As a toddler, Leo rarely made eye contact. In nursery school, he didn't respond to speech like the other kids. He frequently showed compulsive behaviours, like flapping his hands and chewing his clothes. He was easily stressed or overwhelmed. As a result, his diagnosis in 2003, at age two, was relatively straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Rosa wasn't given much guidance about next steps. "I felt very lost," says Rosa, an editor and mother of three who lives in California. "I was really angry." Like so many other parents, what she wanted to know, above all, was why her child had autism. Online, she found other parents seeking the same answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Over the years, Rosa realised she had been mistaken. Not only did Rosa eventually renounce her opposition to vaccination, she started a website, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://thinkingautismguide.com/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Thinking Person's Guide to Autism&lt;/a&gt;, to help others. "I have sympathy for people who believe this stuff because I've been there," she says. "But now I know that that was misinformation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Even today, some places have much higher rates of autism diagnoses than others (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Even today, some places have much higher rates of autism diagnoses than others (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Rosa's story is an example of how, following an autism diagnosis, some families just want clear answers. Earlier this year, the US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr promised a "massive" research effort involving hundreds of scientists, to get to the bottom of what he has called an &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj0z9nmzvdlo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;autism "epidemic"&lt;/a&gt; before September 2025.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That can look alarming to people who don't know [the context of the statistics]", says Zoe Gross, the director of advocacy at the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN), a US nonprofit run by autistic people. It's not necessarily that autism cases are increasing, Gross emphasises: rather, diagnoses are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Screenings for autism have become more sensitive, and many children are getting screened and identified earlier than in past years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As a recognised separate condition, autism is relatively new. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531066/#CR89" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;It wasn't included&lt;/a&gt; in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) – a book with details on the symptoms and recommended treatment of hundreds of mental conditions – until 1980. This means that before then, children with ASD often got misdiagnosed with a condition like schizophrenia, or were never diagnosed at all, Gross says. But even this recognition proved narrow. The 1980 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/eherman/teaching/texts/DSM-I%20-%20DSM-IV%20diagnostic%20criteria.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;criteria included&lt;/a&gt;, for example, an onset before 30 months of age, lack of responsiveness to other people, and language delays – and all of the criteria listed had to be met to receive a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the 45 years since, the diagnostic criteria for autism have broadened. An especially big shift came in 2013, when, for the first time, the DSM brought subcategories including Asperger's syndrome &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531066/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;under the umbrella of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)&lt;/a&gt;. People who wouldn't previously have received an autism diagnosis now are more likely to meet the criteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Autism is highly heritable, but even among identical twins both may not develop it (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Autism is highly heritable, but even among identical twins both may not develop it (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In particular, people have a better understanding of the varied ways that autism may be visible – including in "people who might not have been caught in previous years, who maybe have less intense support needs", Gross says. This is true in many parts of the world. Yun-Joo Koh, the principal investigator at the Korea Institute for Children's Social Development, says that in this country, many parents are learning about ASD through social media and coming to her clinic earlier than they used to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;All of this means fewer hidden cases of autism. "Autistic people have always been here," says Rosa. "But we have never really had a good sense of how many there are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;&lt;span id="in-the-genes" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="in-the-genes" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;In the genes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Autism is very heritable – meaning attributable to &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20250415-the-genetic-mystery-of-why-some-people-develop-autism" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;genetic factors&lt;/a&gt; – but very complex, says Sven Sandin, a statistician and psychiatric epidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sandin’s research across five high-income countries has found that ASD is about &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6646998/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;80% heritable&lt;/a&gt;. That means that, across a population, roughly 80% of the differences in ASD risk are due to genetic variation. In other words, genetics are behind most ASD cases. His research in Sweden has found that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11024771/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;it's especially heritable among boys&lt;/a&gt;: 87% for boys and 75.7% for girls. As with so many aspects of autism epidemiology, it's not clear why, Sandin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But what does seem clear from his work, including &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1866100" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;one of his Swedish studies&lt;/a&gt;, is that autism runs in families. Children whose full sibling had autism were 10 times as likely to have autism themselves, compared to children whose siblings did not have autism. If a half-sibling had autism, children were three times as likely to have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Studies of identical twins have found that if one individual has ASD, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7355281/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;65 to 90%&lt;/a&gt; of their twins also have it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But knowing that autism is heritable does not mean any one gene is responsible in everyone who has it. In fact, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2023/strategic_plan_2023.pdf?ver=8#page=50" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;more than 100 genes&lt;/a&gt; have been identified as having some connection to autism diagnosis – although these are not necessarily specific to autism, and there are often links to other conditions. In some people, it’s thought that there might be &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20250415-the-genetic-mystery-of-why-some-people-develop-autism" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;thousands of genes involved&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;&lt;span id="the-role-of-environment" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="the-role-of-environment" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;The role of environment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But genetics aren't the whole story. "The general belief is… that there is a huge variety of different genes and very complex genetic architecture, and probably with the environmental influences as well, to trigger [autism]", Sandin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images There are some environmental factors involved in the development of autism, but these do not include vaccines (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;There are some environmental factors involved in the development of autism, but these do not include vaccines (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Preterm births are also related to social factors like low income and food insecurity, which may partly explain the steeper rise of autism diagnoses in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/ss/ss7402a1.htm" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;minority children in the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some studies also have found correlations with &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aur.2599" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;birth spacing&lt;/a&gt; and mothers' health conditions, including diabetes, smoking and obesity. But these have proven difficult to untangle – it's not clear whether maternal BMI directly contributes to autism, for example, or if it's just that older mothers tend to have higher BMIs, Sandin says – and may be related to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03479-5" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;shared environmental conditions&lt;/a&gt; rather than a direct link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is possible that at least some of these risk factors, while probably minor players individually, could be more substantial when added together.

"A lot of people are looking for a simple explanation, especially when autism is stigmatised, when they have been told many negative things about for maybe their own child's disability, and they want not only an explanation but something to blame."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The resulting vacuum has created space for simplistic ideas to spread – even those that lack evidence and have been repeatedly debunked. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1708223" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;In the US&lt;/a&gt;, for example, where the current measles outbreak has &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2nzyjgrwxo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;claimed multiple lives&lt;/a&gt;, children whose older siblings have ASD are less likely to be vaccinated themselves against measles, mumps and rubella – &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1708223" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;likely due in part&lt;/a&gt; to the long-debunked link between autism and vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One reason it's common to be alarmed about increasing autism diagnoses, says Gross, is that societies generally haven't built sufficient support systems to accompany a diagnosis. A way to make an autism diagnosis less scary would be to improve the support, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Rosa agrees. The real crisis, she says, is not of autism, but care and support – which she's found lacking for Leo, who is today a 24-year-old who loves hiking and pizza. As Rosa continues seeking the best ways to support her son, researchers will continue unravelling the science of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 09:01:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNTFoxRXFmaHJBSEQ1RWU1OEdUWVlvUDJ2RERSTl92Ry1sWHVRQzh5U05SNTVhVkZNY2xNSUZNSEdYNExpaW5PVm12eFJxRzltOUlWTjBLQnRLRy1uMGxTamFpdVVuMVBPTkV5RV9fbXVPMFdKQlNPbmh3eUctSEdkVkIwVVlQZUk</guid></item><item><title>青少年有常见的疼痛，她认为是由骑自行车引起的-这是致命的4期癌症-每日邮报 | Teenager had common pain she thought was caused by cycling - it was killer stage 4 cancer - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOaUU3bTJGelF3SGNSbm10Q2VEYTRtX1RUU1lqMkEwdlJidERSd3ZQTjVJX1dCZnBUMjhUNWhFRVp2S21hSTdpdGpmWVNxWGtCVGtUMGFwclBRWm5GZzBBUjNzY2JqVUVHdUZsZVEyWml3OVpheVNJM2ZWZGJQVTJaTkJQRUVOQlF4dWNBb0Rqek8yUlJ3UDZOZ2JVdFhicWlO0gGmAUFVX3lxTE8wTmtWbUd6ZVZpTFhVWEdxbGdvQloxQW50LW1JUHBFNFJDS2pHcERIc2hkRE9ndGNzMURGcWVjbkdzSk55dDRxSnlLNldSRllDMW1rVUNfSmdRTGRxVGUwS2ZmbmdOeVZDYmo0NmpSaEZlcFFaTDFTWnJpRzEzMldISmxHQkRUNWpVZS1QWUVBYUNnZk9aM2FZVmZTVzdSNXE5QmU2cHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The heartbroken mother of a 15-year-old has told of her shock at learning her teenager may succumb to late stage bone &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-247d73b0-2ccb-11f0-8f00-edd81b9fdb90"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, despite suffering virtually no symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Millie Dennett, from Poole, Dorset, was a perfectly healthy student when, last month, she fell off her bicycle while out cycling with her father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soon afterwards she developed a pain in her arm, which the family assumed was a result of the accident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when the sensation intensified, her mother Kristina, a 38 year-old carer, decided to take her daughter to A&amp;amp;E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors performed a series of tests including several X-rays, before sending the pair home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But later that evening doctors called Ms Dennett to ask her to bring Millie back to the hospital for an emergency MRI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After spotting a worrying pattern on the scan, the family were referred to a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-35d54d40-2ccb-11f0-8f00-edd81b9fdb90"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; hospital for a biopsy that eventually revealed the devastating truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Millie was diagnosed with stage four osteosarcoma—bone cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, brain, or other bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Healthy and fit Millie Dennett, 15, from Poole, Dorset, was diagnosed with stage four bone cancer after she developed arm pain when she fell off her bike only a few weeks ago in April&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;But Millie and her mother Krista, 38, insisted there were zero warning signs of the tumor in her arm—which had already spread to her chest at a staggering 11 centimetres.

&lt;p&gt;For decades, Alzheimer’s disease has been seen as a one-way road, a slow but inevitable decline in memory and thinking. But new research out of Harvard is beginning to challenge that assumption. A 2024 study suggests that with targeted lifestyle changes, it may be possible to reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms in the early stages, though &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/researchers-found-a-way-to-switch-memories-back-on-in-alzheimers-patients/"&gt;the cure&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a one-size-fits-all kind of deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-024-01482-z"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s Research &amp;amp; Therapy&lt;/em&gt;, followed 50 people with early-stage Alzheimer’s over the course of 20 weeks. Instead of using medication, participants adopted a program focused on a plant-based diet, regular exercise, better sleep habits, and stress reduction. By the end of the study, many showed measurable improvements in cognitive tests. Some even regained skills like remembering names or following conversations.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To get significant results in just 20 weeks, in just 50 patients, only altering lifestyle — to be very honest, was shocking to me,” said senior author Rudolph Tanzi, a Harvard Medical School professor, in a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/07/alzheimers-study-finds-diet-lifestyle-changes-yield-improvements/"&gt;recent statement&lt;/a&gt;. The findings raise the possibility that lifestyle changes alone could help reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms before the disease progresses too far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="is-wp-image-block wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all" alt="MRI of alzheimer's disease" class="is-wp-image-block wp-image-5968984" srcset="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?quality=82 6000w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;amp;quality=82 150w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;amp;quality=82 300w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;amp;quality=82 768w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;amp;quality=82 1024w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;amp;quality=82 1536w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;amp;quality=82 2048w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=63%2C42&amp;amp;quality=82 63w" sizes="(max-width: 6000px) 100vw, 6000px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="is-wp-image-block wp-element-caption"&gt;An MRI showing Alzheimer’s disease in the brain. Image source: Atthapon/Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key factor is insulin resistance, which affects the brain’s ability to process energy. By shifting to a ketogenic or Mediterranean-style diet, participants improved their brain’s energy metabolism. This, in turn, may reduce inflammation and support neural function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.&lt;/h4&gt;	&lt;p class="signup-form-info"&gt;Sign up for the most interesting tech &amp;amp; entertainment news out there.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;p class="signup-form-tos"&gt;By signing up, I agree to the &lt;a rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.com/terms-of-use/" target="_blank"&gt;Terms of Use&lt;/a&gt; and have reviewed the &lt;a rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank"&gt;Privacy Notice.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;span class="success hidden text-white font-bold items-center"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other interventions focused on correcting nutritional deficiencies linked to cognitive decline to try to reverse Alzheimer’s progress. Low levels of vitamin B12, vitamin D, and glutathione, for example, have all been associated with increased Alzheimer’s risk. Improved sleep and regular physical activity also boost blood flow to the brain and promote synaptic health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not every case of Alzheimer’s will respond the same way. The study was relatively small, and most participants had sporadic (non-genetic) Alzheimer’s, which is more likely to be influenced by environmental and lifestyle factors. Experts caution that more research is needed before these findings can be broadly applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, this study offers hope and a practical direction. If you or a loved one is &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/this-ai-can-tell-if-you-might-develop-alzheimers-just-by-hearing-you-speak/"&gt;facing early-stage Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, it’s worth exploring lifestyle changes under a doctor’s guidance. A diet rich in greens and omega-3s, regular movement, and solid sleep habits could do more than just slow symptoms. It might help reverse Alzheimer’s progression altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

and those with weak immune systems, according to lead author Professor Dong Keon Yon from the Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without vaccination, about 30% of people may develop shingles in their lifetime, Yon noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In addition to the rash, shingles has been linked to a higher risk of heart problems, so we wanted to find out if getting vaccinated could lower this risk," he said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study suggests that the shingles vaccine may help lower the risk of heart disease, even in people without known risk factors.

"By preventing shingles, vaccination may lower these risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jasdeep Dalawari, a Virginia-based interventional cardiologist and regional chief medical officer at VitalSolution, an Ingenovis Health company, was not involved in the study but offered his comments on &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the findings;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the findings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This result is notable but requires careful interpretation, especially for the U.S. population," he told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Without vaccination, about 30% of people may develop shingles in their lifetime.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The study used a live vaccine, whereas the U.S. uses Shingrix, a recombinant (non-live) vaccine," Dalawari noted. "It’s important to note that Shingrix is over 90% effective against shingles, compared to the live vaccine's 51%."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The live zoster vaccine contains a weakened form of the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/viruses" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:varicella zoster virus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;varicella zoster virus&lt;/a&gt; that causes shingles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cardiologist also pointed out that the observational study shows correlation, not causation, and that further research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The study included 1.2 million individuals aged 50+, all from one ethnicity," he said.

People who drank less tended to lose a little more weight, the researchers noted, possibly because they were cutting back on alcohol's empty calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The significance of this has to be taken into context of what's available to treat alcohol use disorder," Dr. Maurice O'Farrell, lead author of the study and founder of the Medication Weight Loss Clinic in Dublin, Ireland, told ABC News. "The real advantage that this medication has is compliance, and what this medication does is it gives people a degree of control, it gives the concrete guardrails, and that is something that is completely unique."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scientists have been studying other possible health benefits of GLP-1s besides diabetes management and weight loss for this class of medication, which includes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, in the wake of their booming popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Prior studies and anecdotal reports from patients have hinted that these medications may help cut cravings for alcohol and other addictive substances. One possible explanation is that they act on parts of the brain that control reward and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;According to the study, GLP-1 drugs may affect brain chemicals tied to pleasure and fullness, though more research is needed to fully understand the exact mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"They attenuate dopamine release in reward pathways, and these pathways are common to food satisfaction but also to the pleasure people get from alcohol," O'Farrell said.

              &lt;p&gt;Ozempic and similar drugs aren’t just for weight loss, more and more research is finding. New data is the latest to show that GLP-1 medications help lower people’s alcohol consumption, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in Ireland and Saudi Arabia conducted the study, which involved around 200 patients who were prescribed GLP-1 drugs to manage their obesity. They found that people not only lost weight on the drugs, they also tended to reduce their alcohol intake—by up to two-thirds for those who drank the most beforehand. The findings strengthen the case for GLP-1s as an addiction treatment, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) and similar GLP-1 drugs are &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/semaglutide-tirzepatide-weight-loss-drugs-future-uses-1851116318"&gt;far more effective&lt;/a&gt; at helping people lose weight than diet and exercise alone. But some scientists have also begun to notice that these drugs may help reduce people’s cravings for things besides food, including potentially harmful drugs like opioids, cocaine, and alcohol. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-case-for-ozempic-as-a-addiction-treatment-keeps-getting-better-2000513096"&gt;Early&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/glp-1-drugs-like-ozempic-reduce-cocaine-cravings-case-study-finds-2000565524"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/losing-weight-with-ozempic-might-also-lighten-your-bar-tab-study-finds-2000530051"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; started to support these anecdotal observations as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This new study was prospective, meaning the researchers proactively tracked how people’s alcohol use changed after starting GLP-1 therapy (many past similar studies were retrospective, which only look back in time). The study participants were real-life patients prescribed either semaglutide or liraglutide (an older GLP-1 drug) for weight loss. The participants reported their level of alcohol use before starting the drug, then were asked to come back for follow-up visits three and six months later.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Overall, 188 people returned for at least one follow-up visit. And people who drank alcohol reported drinking less on average after starting a GLP-1 drug. This reduction was especially apparent in those who drank the most to begin with: high consumers (defined as drinking over 11 drinks a week) reported a 68% reduction in their alcohol use, from around 23 drinks a week on average to 8 drinks weekly. That level of reduction is comparable to the effectiveness of existing treatments for alcohol use disorder, the study researchers note.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in alcohol intake among patients treated with GLP-1 RAs,” they wrote in their paper, which is set to be &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1083036"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; this weekend at the annual European Congress on Obesity. The findings were also &lt;a href="https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.16152"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study does have limitations, such as a lack of a control group and a relatively small sample size. There is also still some mystery as how exactly these drugs could affect drug cravings, though it’s suspected that GLP-1 receptors in the brain regulate our response to rewarding and potentially addictive stimuli like alcohol. But the evidence is mounting for GLP-1s having another life as a treatment for substance use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors note that there was a weak positive correlation between the amount of weight someone lost and how much less alcohol they consumed—a connection that makes sense, given how rich in calories alcoholic drinks tend to be. So at the very least, these drugs might serve a dual function for people struggling with their weight and their drinking habits at the same time, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for GLP-1 RAs in managing co-occurring obesity and alcohol use,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it will take randomized and controlled clinical trials to truly know whether semaglutide can become a reliable front-line option for substance use disorders, some of which are &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06015893?cond=Alcohol%20Use%20Disorder&amp;amp;intr=semaglutide&amp;amp;rank=4"&gt;already underway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

County each year, infected at least 138 people in 2024 and cases have remained unusually high so far in 2025. Officials say that levels of the virus in local wastewater suggest &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/diseases/hepa-data.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;these figures are an undercount&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-59aff52b"&gt;How is hepatitis A transmitted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The hepatitis A virus is spread through the so-called oral-fecal route, which means it is ingested through food or drinks that have been contaminated by microscopic bits of stool from an infected person. It can also spread through close contact with someone who is carrying the virus, even if they don’t show any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Unhoused people are often at greater risk of contracting hepatitis A because they have limited access to proper toilets and hand-washing facilities. The virus is also more common among travelers to places with poor sanitation, men who have sex with men and people who use drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But officials say many of the recent cases have occurred in people without those risk factors. They do not yet know why, but Dr. Timothy Brewer, an infectious disease physician and epidemiologist at U.C.L.A., said it had led him to worry about two things: &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/frozen-strawberries-2023/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;food contamination&lt;/a&gt;, and community circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“If you’re practicing good hygiene in a community that has access to potable water, you really should not be seeing a lot of this,” he said. “Something is going on — but exactly what that something is, we don’t yet know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

          &lt;p&gt;A starry sky can be stunning—even inside a hospital emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But instead of celestial bodies sparkling in the night, doctors in South Korea were gazing at bright brain lesions punctuating a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The resulting pattern, called a "starry sky," meant that their 57-year-old patient had a dangerous form of tuberculosis. The doctors &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2415077?logout=true"&gt;report the case&lt;/a&gt; in this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man had previously been treated for the infection in his lungs but came into the hospital's emergency department after two weeks of unexplained headaches, neck pain, and tingling in his right hand. The MRI and Computed-Tomography (CT) scans clearly revealed the problem: rare nodules and lesions, called tuberculomas, speckling his lungs and central nervous system, including both cerebral hemispheres, the basal ganglia deep inside the brain, the cerebellum at the back of the brain, the brain stem, and the upper spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2094308 align-center"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head with gadolinium enhancement revealed numerous small, spherical, peripherally enhancing nodules in the cerebral hemispheres (Panels A and B), basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brain stem, as well as in the upper spinal cord with surrounding edema (Panel C).

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The condition, called CNS tuberculoma, is a relatively rare manifestation of tuberculosis, which typically infects the lungs but can invade any part of the body. It's unclear exactly how tuberculomas form, but evidence suggests that the bacteria that cause tuberculosis—&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis—&lt;/em&gt;can spread around the body via the blood. &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;M. tuberculosis &lt;/em&gt;can get past the blood-brain barrier, possibly by hiding inside a type of white blood cell called a macrophage, in a "Trojan horse" mechanism or by breaking through the barrier.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK585138/"&gt;Tuberculomas are thought to form&lt;/a&gt; when bacteria and macrophages clump together into masses that may contain calcifications or cheese-like dead tissue called caseum.&lt;/p&gt;

            Measles cases continue to accumulate in the United States in what is already the second-worst year since the disease was declared eliminated a quarter-century ago. Now, a recent outbreak in one North Dakota county has led local health officials to quarantine nearly 200 unvaccinated students.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky00063b6mosmds0h6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            North Dakota has reported &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.nd.gov/news/nine-cases-measles-williams-county" target="_blank"&gt;nine measles&lt;/a&gt; cases this year, and a recent outbreak among schoolchildren in Williams County in the northwest part of the state has led local health officials to enforce a law that requires unvaccinated students to quarantine for 21 days after exposure to someone who has the virus. The move was taken by local public health officers in the Upper Missouri District Health Unit, and the state health department is assisting with mitigation efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky00073b6mgjouu841@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Tuesday, families of 188 unvaccinated students in the Williston Basin School District No. 7 received a letter informing them that their children would&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;need to quarantine for three weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky00083b6m25pchj1k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About two weeks earlier, district nurse coordinator Lynn Douglas had sent a letter to all families in anticipation of an outbreak, preemptively outlining the quarantine procedure and highlighting the importance of prevention, including vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky00093b6ml3h0ul3a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Williston Basin School District #7 plays a very important role in the health and well-being of our students,” Douglas said in an email to CNN. “Having vaccine-preventable diseases circulating within a school would lead to large numbers of school absences and adversely affect the health of our students.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000a3b6mm2vvoozd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While even a small drop in immunization rates can lead to outbreaks, unvaccinated students are at significant risk of serious illness and complications from measles, which are highly contagious and preventable diseases,” she said. “WBSD #7 prioritizes student safety by taking measures to protect unvaccinated students and prevent the spread of illness to themselves, their families, and others and in order to do this, students must be excluded.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000b3b6m6hqiyk46@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been at least 1,018 measles cases reported in the US in 2025, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The CDC publishes data on measles cases each Friday, but it has stopped providing details on the specific number of cases in each state, and its national total does not always capture the latest updates from states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000c3b6m4olgaqsp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of these cases – at least 845 – are associated with an outbreak centered in West Texas that has expanded to New Mexico, Oklahoma and possibly Kansas. Texas has reported 709 outbreak-associated cases, New Mexico reported 71 cases, and Oklahoma reported 17 cases – 14 confirmed and three probable – as of Friday. Cases in Kansas, which the state health department says may be linked to the outbreak, have reached 48 as of Wednesday. Experts say these numbers are all a severe undercount because many cases are going unreported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000d3b6mkzblgqvd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, 2019 is only other year in which there were more than 1,000 cases, driven by large outbreaks in New York City and a nearby suburb. There were 1,274 confirmed measles cases that year, according to the CDC, only about 250 more than have been reported so far in 2025.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000e3b6m10oqwmo7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nationwide, CDC data shows that 126 people have been hospitalized with measles this year – about 13% of all cases – and there have been three confirmed deaths associated with the large multistate outbreak: two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all of whom were unvaccinated. The vast majority of cases in the US this year have been in people who are unvaccinated; only about 4% of confirmed cases have been in people who had received one or two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000f3b6mhr9pfdpq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been 14 total outbreaks this year, and 30 states have reported at least one case, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Measles cases continue to accumulate in the United States in what is already the second-worst year since the disease was declared eliminated a quarter-century ago. Now, a recent outbreak in one North Dakota county has led local health officials to quarantine nearly 200 unvaccinated students.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky00063b6mosmds0h6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            North Dakota has reported &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.nd.gov/news/nine-cases-measles-williams-county" target="_blank"&gt;nine measles&lt;/a&gt; cases this year, and a recent outbreak among schoolchildren in Williams County in the northwest part of the state has led local health officials to enforce a law that requires unvaccinated students to quarantine for 21 days after exposure to someone who has the virus. The move was taken by local public health officers in the Upper Missouri District Health Unit, and the state health department is assisting with mitigation efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky00073b6mgjouu841@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Tuesday, families of 188 unvaccinated students in the Williston Basin School District No. 7 received a letter informing them that their children would&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;need to quarantine for three weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky00083b6m25pchj1k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About two weeks earlier, district nurse coordinator Lynn Douglas had sent a letter to all families in anticipation of an outbreak, preemptively outlining the quarantine procedure and highlighting the importance of prevention, including vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky00093b6ml3h0ul3a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Williston Basin School District #7 plays a very important role in the health and well-being of our students,” Douglas said in an email to CNN. “Having vaccine-preventable diseases circulating within a school would lead to large numbers of school absences and adversely affect the health of our students.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000a3b6mm2vvoozd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While even a small drop in immunization rates can lead to outbreaks, unvaccinated students are at significant risk of serious illness and complications from measles, which are highly contagious and preventable diseases,” she said. “WBSD #7 prioritizes student safety by taking measures to protect unvaccinated students and prevent the spread of illness to themselves, their families, and others and in order to do this, students must be excluded.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000b3b6m6hqiyk46@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been at least 1,018 measles cases reported in the US in 2025, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The CDC publishes data on measles cases each Friday, but it has stopped providing details on the specific number of cases in each state, and its national total does not always capture the latest updates from states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000c3b6m4olgaqsp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of these cases – at least 845 – are associated with an outbreak centered in West Texas that has expanded to New Mexico, Oklahoma and possibly Kansas. Texas has reported 709 outbreak-associated cases, New Mexico reported 71 cases, and Oklahoma reported 17 cases – 14 confirmed and three probable – as of Friday. Cases in Kansas, which the state health department says may be linked to the outbreak, have reached 48 as of Wednesday. Experts say these numbers are all a severe undercount because many cases are going unreported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000d3b6mkzblgqvd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, 2019 is only other year in which there were more than 1,000 cases, driven by large outbreaks in New York City and a nearby suburb. There were 1,274 confirmed measles cases that year, according to the CDC, only about 250 more than have been reported so far in 2025.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000e3b6m10oqwmo7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nationwide, CDC data shows that 126 people have been hospitalized with measles this year – about 13% of all cases – and there have been three confirmed deaths associated with the large multistate outbreak: two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all of whom were unvaccinated. The vast majority of cases in the US this year have been in people who are unvaccinated; only about 4% of confirmed cases have been in people who had received one or two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000f3b6mhr9pfdpq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been 14 total outbreaks this year, and 30 states have reported at least one case, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

This approach focuses on tracking AMPARs—key receptors that regulate synaptic strength—over time, illuminating how the brain encodes, strengthens, and stores memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using advanced fluorescence labeling and high-resolution imaging, the team traced memory-linked synaptic changes in mice during learning tasks, revealing the rules that guide how specific synapses are modified. The findings have major implications for understanding memory disorders like Alzheimer’s and may support the development of targeted therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Mapping Breakthrough:&lt;/strong&gt; EPSILON tracks AMPAR protein movement during synaptic plasticity in live brains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Resolution Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Enables visualization of memory-related synaptic changes over time and space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could inform new treatments for memory-impairing conditions like dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Harvard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A team of Harvard researchers have unveiled a way to map the molecular underpinnings of how learning and memories are formed, a groundbreaking new technique expected to offer insights that may pave the way for new treatments for neurological disorders such as dementia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This technique provides a lens into the synaptic architecture of memory, something previously unattainable in such detail,” said Adam Cohen, professor of chemistry and chemical biology and of physics and senior co-author of the research paper, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory resides within a dense network of billions of neurons within the brain. We rely on synaptic plasticity — the strengthening and modulation of connections between these neurons — to facilitate learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109722"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;As synaptic changes of specific memories came into view with greater clarity, patterns started to reveal rules governing how the brain decides which synapses to make stronger or weaker when storing a memory. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synapses, or the junctions where neurons communicate, lay the groundwork for every memory we form, from a childhood melody to a loved one’s face to what we ate for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new paper, the team detailed their new technique, dubbed Extracellular Protein Surface Labeling in Neurons (EPSILON), which focuses on mapping the proteins vital for the transmission of signals across synaptic connections in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These specific proteins are called AMPARs and are considered key players in synaptic plasticity, the process that allows the brain to adapt and reorganize itself in response to new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utilizing sequential labeling with specialized dyes, EPSILON enabled the researchers to monitor these proteins’ movements at high resolutions. Traditionally, understanding such detailed microscopic phenomena has required more invasive methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using EPSILON to observe AMPARs’ behavior in neurons represents a significant scientific advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was undertaken by several members of Cohen’s lab, including Harvard Griffin GSAS student Doyeon Kim and postdoctoral scholars Pojeong Park, Xiuyuan Li, J. David Wong-Campos, He Tian, and Eric M. Moult, as well as scientists from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of fluorescent labeling and cutting-edge microscopy allowed the researchers to illuminate synaptic behavior at unprecedented resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique’s precision was akin to shining a spotlight on some of the brain’s most intricate functions, allowing the team to monitor the synaptic interactions critical for learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research into synaptic processes often lacked such granularity, making EPSILON’s insights particularly valuable for future explorations into diseases like Alzheimer’s, marked by synaptic dysfunction that results in memory and learning impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As synaptic changes of specific memories came into view with greater clarity, patterns started to reveal rules governing how the brain decides which synapses to make stronger or weaker when storing a memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our most important breakthrough is our method that can map the past history of the synthetic plasticity in the living brain,” Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can look at the history of the synaptic plasticity, studying where and how much of the synaptic potentiation has happened during a defined time window during the memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By mapping the synaptic plasticity over time at multiple time points, we can truly map the dynamics of the synapses,” Kim added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll also be able to apply this to different kinds of memories that have different patterns of synaptic plasticity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique’s first application has already yielded intriguing results. By applying EPSILON to study mice undergoing contextual fear conditioning — a process that helps animals associate a neutral context with a fear-inducing stimulus — researchers were able to demonstrate a correlation between AMPARs and the expression of the immediate early gene product cFos, a signal that tells us when brain cells are active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that AMPAR trafficking is closely linked to enduring memory traces, or engrams, within the brain, where specific neurons become activated following learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen credits the significant and sometimes unexpected role basic science can play in fueling progress with enabling their study to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The HaloTag technology, which is used to label proteins, was based on a gene discovered in 1997 by a group of scientists in Ireland who were studying a soil bacterium, which had an unusual ability to break down pollutants,” Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a generations-long arc from the basic research characterizing the natural world to making discoveries that can make human health better. We really need to support the entire arc to make progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, Cohen is eager to see how EPSILON can be further applied to study numerous cognitive phenomena and potentially improve therapeutic strategies targeting memory impairments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve already distributed the molecular tool to labs around the world who are now starting to use these tools to explore how synaptic strength is regulated in their favorite question and context,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was partially supported the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory and neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yahya Chaudhry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Yahya Chaudhry – Harvard&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01922-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EPSILON: a method for pulse-chase labeling to probe synaptic AMPAR exocytosis during memory formation&lt;/a&gt;” by Adam Cohen et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EPSILON: a method for pulse-chase labeling to probe synaptic AMPAR exocytosis during memory formation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tool to map changes in synaptic strength during a defined time window could provide powerful insights into the mechanisms of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we developed a technique, Extracellular Protein Surface Labeling in Neurons (EPSILON), to map α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) exocytosis in vivo by sequential pulse-chase labeling of surface AMPARs with membrane-impermeable dyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach yields synaptic-resolution maps of AMPAR exocytosis, a proxy for synaptic potentiation, in genetically targeted neurons during memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice undergoing contextual fear conditioning, we investigated the relationship between synapse-level AMPAR exocytosis in CA1 pyramidal neurons and cell-level expression of the immediate early gene product cFos, a frequently used marker of engram neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observed a strong correlation between AMPAR exocytosis and cFos expression, suggesting a synaptic mechanism for the association of cFos expression with memory engrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EPSILON technique is a useful tool for mapping synaptic plasticity and may be extended to investigate trafficking of other transmembrane proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Diet plays a role in diverticulitis risk—but not in the way you might think.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study published in &lt;em&gt;the Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt; revealed that eating nuts, seeds, and corn was not associated with an increased chance of a diverticulitis diagnosis in women. What &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;matter in terms of diverticulitis risk? Broader diet patterns, smoking, heavy alcohol use, and excess weight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/diverticulitis-overview-7504021" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Diverticulitis&lt;/a&gt; occurs when pouches called diverticula form in the colon and become inflamed. It can cause symptoms like abdominal pain, fever, and changes in bowel habits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study findings debunk a common misconception that small, hard foods could cause diverticulitis—or damage the compromised intestinal wall in people with the condition. They also expand upon previous study results that only applied to men. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A single study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA &lt;/em&gt;in 2008 found no association between these foods and the development of diverticulitis in men,” study author &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/medicine/gi/people/anne-peery-md-mscr/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Anne Peery, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;. “This study has never been replicated. Although many providers no longer make this recommendation, many patients with a history of diverticulitis continue to limit these foods in their diet.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-role-of-nuts-and-seeds-in-diverticulitis"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For years, avoiding small, hard foods was considered gold standard dietary guidance for people with diverticulitis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Foods like nuts, seeds, and corn were historically considered problematic due to the belief that these small, hard particles could become lodged in diverticula, leading to inflammation or infection,” &lt;a href="https://atlanticcoastgastro.com/physicians/sandhya-shukla-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sandhya Shukla, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Atlantic Coast Gastroenterology Associates in New Jersey, told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, more recent evidence has challenged this notion, such as the 2008 study that found it to be false for men. Because research has been lacking in women, Peery and her colleagues aimed to pin down whether this applied to females, too. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers studied data on over 29,000 women aged 35 to 74. The participants completed questionnaires that detailed their dietary habits from 2003 to 2009 and then every two to three years until 2022.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Using statistical analysis tools, the researchers determined that women who ate foods like nuts, seeds, and fruits with seeds—even in large amounts—had no higher risk of developing diverticulitis than those who ate these foods less often. The research also found no association between eating these foods and needing surgery or hospitalization for diverticulitis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study did have a few limitations, though. The researchers included women who said they had diverticulitis or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/condition/gastrointestinal-infections/diverticulosis-vs-diverticulitis" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diverticulosis&lt;/a&gt; (in which colon pouches are present but are not inflamed). Because diverticulosis doesn’t cause symptoms, some cases may have been missed, making results harder to interpret. Plus, the researchers acknowledged that their study was correlational, not causational and that unknown factors could have affected outcomes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-actually-increases-diverticulitis-risk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though nuts, seeds, and corn are no longer on the naughty list for diverticulitis, other, more general diet and lifestyle factors do seem to make a meaningful difference to risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The new&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;study found that women with diverticulitis were more likely to be current or former smokers, report heavy alcohol use, and have a BMI classified as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/overweight-8658046" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;overweight&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/obesity-7967228" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;obese&lt;/a&gt;, compared with those without diverticulitis. Additionally, being &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/menopause-overview-7485701" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;postmenopausal&lt;/a&gt; and using &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/hormone-replacement-therapy-8630891" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;menopausal hormone therapy&lt;/a&gt; increased risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shukla added that overall diet choices, rather than specific “no-no” foods, are a likely indicator of developing diverticulitis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Dietary patterns, such as the Western diet, which involves the consumption of red meats, processed foods, and high-fat dairy, are associated with a higher risk,” she said. A 2021 review of 8 studies confirmed that people who ate Western diets high in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/red-meat-benefits-8684490" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; were more likely to experience diverticulitis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-following-a-healthy-diet-for-diverticulitis"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers also examined how four healthy eating plans—the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/mediterranean-diet-facts-benefits-and-foods-7152979" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/dash-diet-7972360" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;DASH&lt;/a&gt;) diet, Healthy Eating Index 2015, and Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010—might affect diverticulitis risk. They found that all of them reduced it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This isn’t surprising, according to &lt;a href="http://www.guthealthconnection.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kim Kulp, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Gut Health Connection in the San Francisco Bay Area.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Diet patterns like the Mediterranean diet, which include a variety of plant foods, have been shown to decrease the risk of diverticulitis,” she told &lt;em&gt;Health. &lt;/em&gt;“Eating lots of fruits, vegetables, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/food/18-health-benefits-of-whole-grains" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt;, nuts, seeds, and legumes provides fuel for the good gut microbes, which protect the intestinal lining from inflammation that can lead to diverticulitis.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, some research has found that the health of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/microbiome-definition-8645248" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; is a strong predictor of whether people develop diverticular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/health-benefits-of-fiber-7555609" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; is such a critical component in maintaining a healthy microbiome, Kulp said more of this nutrient is better for minimizing diverticulitis risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to follow your doctor’s guidance for your specific digestive issues. But ultimately, previous clinical guidance to nix certain foods is not only outdated—it’s diametrically opposed to today’s understanding of diet for diverticulitis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Since corn, nuts, and seeds contain fiber and haven’t been shown to cause more diverticulitis, these foods should be included, not avoided,” Kulp said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;In December, Jack Anton woke up and started to feel dizzy. Over the following days, the dizziness worsened, to the point where it was difficult to walk. Around New Year’s Day, the Ephrata-area man went to the emergency department at Tower Health’s Reading Hospital, where he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Anton later underwent surgery to remove the tumor, which was found to be cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he had gotten sick just a few years earlier, the 26-year-old would have had to travel an hour or more to Philadelphia — either daily trips or a weekslong stay — to receive proton therapy to treat his cancer. But with Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health’s Proton Therapy Center now established in East Hempfield Township, Anton’s travel time during his radiation treatment was only a half-hour each way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anton is one of more than 300 people to be treated at the center since it opened at the Ann B. Barshinger Cancer Institute in 2022. Some of those patients have come from more than 100 miles away, but the majority are from Lancaster County, like Anton. That’s according to data provided through an LG Health spokesperson by Dr. Pamela J. Boimel, medical director and chair of radiation oncology at LG Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;READ: &lt;a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/health/how-has-lg-health-changed-in-the-10-years-since-joining-penn-medicine/article_8411a42a-e25e-11ef-bc08-c34a58d914c5.html" target="_blank"&gt;How has LG Health changed in the 10 years since joining Penn Medicine?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The center treats 20 to 25 people every day, Boimel said, and exceeded goals for the number of patients treated. It was projected that 110 patients would start treatment during the 2023 calendar year, its first full year of operations. The actual number of patients treated that year was 120. In 2024, 152 patients were treated, exceeding the projected number of 150. The projection for subsequent years is 180 patients starting treatment annually, which the center may exceed this year, according to information provided by Boimel through the spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LG Health's center is only the second proton therapy center in the state, following Penn Medicine's Roberts Proton Therapy Center in Philadelphia, which opened in 2010. Other centers are located in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to get cancer care close to home is important, Boimel said — patients don’t want to travel for cancer care. And it’s also an issue of health equity, as some people are unable to make the trip, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to bring more advanced treatments ... closer to patients’ home(s) leads to them being able to obtain treatments they might not have previously sought out, even if it means a better outcome for them,” Boimel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Minor side effects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more precise form of radiation treatment, proton therapy is used when the cancer is located near an organ or structure that would suffer significant side effects if exposed to low-dose radiation, Boimel said. These include the brain, where radiation can cause neurocognitive effects and memory issues, and the mouth, where salivary glands and taste buds can be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anton had a tumor about the size of a golf ball in the back of his brain, which was pushing against his spinal cord and cerebellum. After being transferred to Penn Medicine’s Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, he had surgery that removed 90% of the tumor, which was a type of cancer called sarcoma. Sarcoma is a group of cancers that arise in the bones and in soft tissues such as fat, nerves and muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;READ: &lt;a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/local/penn-medicine-lancaster-general-health-unveils-50m-proton-therapy-center-at-ann-b-barshinger-cancer/article_9ce6987c-2585-11ed-bc77-6b2a9fef6175.html" target="_blank"&gt;Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health unveils $50M proton therapy center at Ann B. Barshinger Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anton was given the option of staying in Philadelphia — with the potential to board during his treatment — for what would be weeks of proton therapy, or receiving the same treatment in Lancaster County, around 30 minutes from his home, he said. He chose the Lancaster County option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It made a huge impact on my daily life ... not having to ... go live in Philly for eight weeks. I mean, mentally, I knew I couldn’t do that, so that’s why I chose to do Lancaster,” Anton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anton received proton therapy every weekday morning at 7 a.m. for about seven weeks. During the treatment, he experienced brain fog, a couple of headaches, a bit of nausea and a period of short-term memory loss, he said. But he described these side effects as minor. And he wasn’t neurologically affected by the surgery, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his radiation treatment, Anton was able to continue his job as a resource conservation technician for the Berks County Conservation District, something that probably wouldn’t have been possible if he’d stayed in Philly for treatment, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Insurance approvals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 330 people treated so far at the center, 178 were from Lancaster County, 23 were from Dauphin County, 22 were from York County, 19 were from Berks County and 10 were from Chester County. Another 22 were from parts of Pennsylvania more than 100 miles away from the center, while 14 were from out of state, according to data provided by Boimel through the spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very surprising, I think, and unusual that ... we have become kind of a place where people are seeking out care from very far away,” Boimel said. “Even though we’re a community center, we are offering this academic-level treatment that patients normally would seek out in large cities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Boimel and her colleagues are not trying to use proton therapy for all their patients — they use it for conditions that would benefit from proton therapy in particular, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also helps when dealing with insurance companies. Some insurance providers are resistant to new or advanced cancer treatments, Boimel said, and it can sometimes be difficult to have proton therapy covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oftentimes proton therapy centers ... struggle financially because they end up treating patients where maybe the insurance companies weren’t going to pay, and they have trouble finding patients where the insurance companies will pay for treatment,” Boimel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for types of cancer where proton therapy is “very much indicated by research and data,” insurance companies don’t have a problem approving it, Boimel said. Because LG Health’s center treats the cases where proton therapy is beneficial — and where insurance companies recognize that the treatment is indicated — the center isn’t struggling to get the treatments approved by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking forward&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anton completed his radiation treatments in mid April, and rang the bell at the center to celebrate the milestone. The next day, he got to sleep in — after weeks of waking up at around 5 a.m. to go to treatment, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, he’s awaiting an appointment on May 22, where he’ll get a follow-up MRI and will possibly discuss whether he needs chemotherapy, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anton is a little nervous about the scan — “how could you not be,” he said, but he is trying not to think about it too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite this experience, Anton hasn’t changed his perspective on life — a perspective characterized by living in the present and appreciating the little stuff, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I luckily had a good outlook on life before this, and so it hasn’t really changed,” Anton said. “I appreciate every hour ... I spend with my friends and family, and every time I get to cruise around with the windows open and the music on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-block-1010628" class="tncms-block invert-btn-primary"&gt;&lt;section id="block-1010628" class="block emphasis-h3   "&gt;&lt;div class=" card-bg-color"&gt;&lt;div class="card-panel panel"&gt;

            To get screened for cervical cancer, patients in the United States may no longer need to put their feet in those awkward stirrups, brace for the uncomfortable speculum or even take the time off from work for an in-person doctor’s appointment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2hurh000y3b6mo4vjvuxb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Soon, they will have the option to collect their own vaginal samples for screening from home – instead of a health care provider doing it for them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the first at-home self-collection device for cervical cancer screening in the United States, called the Teal Wand, according to the women’s health company Teal Health. Last year, the FDA gave the company’s Teal Wand “breakthrough device” status, allowing the agency to review it on a faster timeline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz00073b6m3ml13k5l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Teal Wand, which will be provided in Teal Health’s at-home self-collection kit, will require a prescription. Self-collected samples using the Wand are then mailed to a lab to be tested for HPV, the &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-approves-teal-healths-teal-wandthe-first-and-only-at-home-self-collection-device-for-cervical-cancer-screening-introducing-a-comfortable-alternative-to-in-person-screening-302451189.html?tc=eml_cleartime" target="_blank"&gt;company announced&lt;/a&gt; Friday. Most &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/basic_info/risk_factors.htm?c" target="_blank"&gt;cervical cancers&lt;/a&gt; are caused by human papillomavirus or HPV, and screening for HPV can help identify women who may be at risk of developing cervical cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz00093b6mdezj6ndu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Typically, when screening for cervical cancer, gynecologists collect samples for HPV testing, cervical cytology or both. Cervical cytology, also known as a Pap test or Pap smear, involves examining cervical cells for changes to detect precancerous or cancerous cells. The HPV test checks cells for infection with the high-risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer.

            Last year, the FDA greenlit similar self-collection cervical cancer screening kits for use in a medical setting, such as at a doctor’s office, an urgent care or even a mobile clinic. At the time, two health care businesses – biotechnology company &lt;a href="https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2024-05-15" target="_blank"&gt;Roche&lt;/a&gt; and medical technology firm &lt;a href="https://news.bd.com/2024-05-15-Women-in-U-S-Can-Now-Collect-Their-Own-Sample-for-Cervical-Cancer-Screening" target="_blank"&gt;Becton, Dickson and Company&lt;/a&gt; – said the FDA had approved the use of self-collected samples with their respective HPV tests.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000b3b6mcm1xxy3g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Teal Health at-home kit allows a patient to collect their sample using the Teal Wand, which is then processed on Roche’s HPV test, said Kara Egan, Teal Health’s CEO. But a major difference is that the Teal Wand is approved to be used at home, so patients don’t have to travel to or make time for in-person doctor appointments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2tg1l001g3b6m1d813o01@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To use Teal Health’s new self-collection kit, “you request a kit at the Teal website, meet with a provider who prescribes the kit, then comfortably and privately collect at home and mail to the lab to process on the Roche Cobas HPV test,” Egan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2xxz5001j3b6m38e7ryld@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The results are then reviewed by a clinician and shared back,” she said. “If the results are positive, a provider will meet with you and refer you to any required follow-up.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000g3b6m6x8i44fj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Clinical trial &lt;a href="https://www.getteal.com/research/u-s-clinical-study-demonstrates-94-of-women-prefer-at-home-cervical-cancer-screening" target="_blank"&gt;data from Teal Health&lt;/a&gt; has found that self-collection with the Teal Wand has the same accuracy for cervical cancer screening as when a health care provider collects a sample, Egan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000h3b6mocsvgmtd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s the same test, same accuracy, but you can comfortably do it from home,” she said. “It gives women more options, and with telehealth, we see more options to get access to care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000i3b6mnf6gdcsd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Teal Health plans to begin shipping its at-home self-collection kits in June, Egan said, starting in California before expanding nationwide. A waitlist is available at the &lt;a href="https://www.getteal.com/" target="_blank"&gt;company’s website&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Teal Health has been in talks with health insurance companies about having the self-collection kit covered, Egan added, and for people who don’t have insurance, the cost of the kit will be announced within the next month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The American Cancer Society applauded the new FDA approval.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah3z8he001u3b6mtskb05vo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Despite the benefits of cervical cancer screening, not all eligible are screened regularly,” Dr. William Dahut, the society’s chief scientific officer, said in an email Friday. “Most cervical cancers are found in people who have never had a cervical cancer screening test or who have not had one recently. That’s why today’s Food and Drug Administration’s announcement approving the first at-home test to screen for cervical cancer as an additional cancer screening method for this potentially deadly disease will make a huge impact.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Some of the most important steps women can take to help reduce their risk for cervical cancer, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/prevention/?c" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, are to get vaccinated against HPV, avoid smoking, use condoms during sex, have regular screening tests and check with their doctor if their test results are not normal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000q3b6mnarhvk8u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s estimated that about 1 in 4 adults are not up to date on cervical cancer screening recommendations, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2023/23_0071.htm" target="_blank"&gt;according to data from 2021&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Some women are scared of a traditional pap smear or find the process uncomfortable, as a result they put off this vital test,” Dr. &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/ami-p-vaidya/1318087" target="_blank"&gt;Ami Vaidya&lt;/a&gt;, co-chief of gynecologic oncology at Hackensack University Medical Center’s &lt;a href="https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/en/locations/john-theurer-cancer-center?placement=&amp;amp;target=&amp;amp;keyword=john%20theurer%20cancer%20center&amp;amp;matchtype=e&amp;amp;hgcrm_channel=paid_search&amp;amp;hgcrm_source=google_adwords&amp;amp;hgcrm_agency=client&amp;amp;hgcrm_campaignid=8991&amp;amp;hgcrm_tacticid=12043&amp;amp;hgcrm_trackingsetid=17437&amp;amp;utm_source=Google-Assembly&amp;amp;utm_medium=SEM&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Oncology&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22496171240&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAAoKg1oYVP8ALlxrTvqyWrt2OjVvB7&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwz_bABhAGEiwAm-P8YX8eRmK1QYlru8BPXyHBfhyx5ZefApfUH2fja4QwBvG4gBHSbgxkbxoCliIQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank"&gt;John Theurer Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt;, said in a news release Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah42ats00233b6m3hglq2t3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The newly approved at-home screening device “could be an important tool in getting more women regularly screened, especially those that don’t have access to a medical provider,” Vaidya said. “Any type of test that helps detect cervical cancer is a win.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000r3b6mvud4cuh6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/cervical-cancer-screening" target="_blank"&gt;US Preventive Services Task Force recommends&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical/screening" target="_blank"&gt;screening for cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt; with cervical cytology – also known as a Pap test or Pap smear – every three years for women ages 21 to 29. For women 30 to 65, the USPSTF recommends screening every three years with cervical cytology alone, every five years with high-risk HPV testing alone, or every five years with high-risk HPV testing in combination with cytology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000t3b6mrf5vh3ak@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s estimated that about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/hcp/schedules-recommendations.html" target="_blank"&gt;80% of people will get an HPV infection&lt;/a&gt; in their lifetime. HPV, a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/diseases/hpv/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;group of more than 150 viruses&lt;/a&gt;, is spread primarily through sexual contact and includes low-risk strains, which most often cause warts, and high-risk strains, which have been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, such as cervical, anal, penile and oropharyngeal cancers. In most cases, HPV clears on its own within two years, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/about/about-genital-hpv-infection.html" target="_blank"&gt;when the infection does not go away&lt;/a&gt;, health problems like cancer may occur.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000u3b6mobqy3c6x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Screening for cervical cancer remains important because early cases often may not have signs or symptoms. Advanced cases may cause abnormal vaginal bleeding or unusual discharge. Cervical cancer is treated in many ways, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports there have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;1,001 confirmed measles cases&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. this year. It's the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;second-highest case count&lt;/a&gt; in 25 years, topped only by 2019, when more than 1,200 measles cases were detected. The best way to contain measles is two doses of the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps and rubella).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here are numbers to help you understand how measles is spreading now.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1,001 cases:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC keeps &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/" target="_blank"&gt;track of confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; and is updating its count on a weekly basis. On May 2, it reported 935 cases. On Friday, it reported cases have ticked past the thousand mark, to 1,001.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31 jurisdictions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Measles cases have been reported in 31 jurisdictions, up from 30 on May 1. Cases have been reported in more than half of U.S. states this year, but not all of those states have full-fledged outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14 outbreaks&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;An outbreak is defined as 3 or more related cases. So while the total number of cases is important, the number of outbreaks shows where the virus is spreading. The number of outbreaks went from 12 last week to 14 this week.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;By far the largest outbreak is centered in west Texas, where measles has been spreading since January. Reported cases in that outbreak totaled 683 last week and 709 this week.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 deaths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Two unvaccinated, otherwise healthy children in Texas have died of the disease. One adult in New Mexico was diagnosed with measles posthumously.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a population where no one is vaccinated, a single person sick with measles &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread" target="_blank"&gt;could go on to infect up to 18 others&lt;/a&gt; on average. By comparison, when 82% of a population is vaccinated, a sick person would infect about 2 to 3 other unvaccinated people on average.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;95% vaccination rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To prevent outbreaks from spreading within a community, there needs to be a vaccination rate of 95%, according to the CDC. Below that threshold, a community's herd immunity can begin to erode. In Gaines County, Texas, the epicenter of the outbreak in that state and where measles is still spreading, the kindergarten vaccination rate against measles is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/07/nx-s1-5312107/how-a-measles-outbreak-overwhelmed-a-small-west-texas-town" target="_blank"&gt;just under 82%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Herd immunity means that enough members of a community are immune to a contagious disease that it is unlikely to keep spreading because there aren't enough people vulnerable to infection. Herd immunity protects people with weakened immune systems and children who have not yet completed their two-shot series of the measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 months&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's an open question how long measles will keep spreading in the U.S. The Texas outbreak, the biggest one, began in January. If any single outbreak continues to result in ongoing transmission for more than 12 months, the U.S. will lose its &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/242035/WER8809_89-98.PDF?sequence=1" target="_blank"&gt;measles "elimination" status&lt;/a&gt;. That's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/08/1243384827/getting-measles-under-control" target="_blank"&gt;a technical term in public health for contagions&lt;/a&gt; that have been well-controlled for 12 months or more. The U.S. has had that status for about 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A new approach surfaced when Alice Ball from the University of Hawaii transformed it into a more soluble form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alice-ball-had-a-passion-for-chemistry"&gt;Alice Ball had a passion for chemistry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0738081X22001663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alice was born&lt;/a&gt; on July 24, 1892, in Seattle, Washington, into a family that valued creativity and learning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her parents’ interests in newspapers and photography exposed her to different fields beyond traditional academics, and encouraged her inquisitive spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the University of Washington, she explored pharmaceutical &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/100-year-old-chemistry-rule-bredts-rule-proven-false-updating-textbooks-comes-next/"&gt;chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, a discipline focused on the creation and refinement of medicinal compounds from natural or synthetic sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She earned her first degree in 1912 and a second in 1914, demonstrating unusual drive for someone her age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-call-to-tropical-medicine"&gt;The call to tropical medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her quest for deeper knowledge led her to the &lt;a href="https://www.hawaii.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, where she studied the &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/kava" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;kava plant&lt;/a&gt;, a botanical with bioactive components. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kava was known for its soothing effects in some cultural settings, making it an intriguing subject for a talented researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her success in that research drew the attention of &lt;a href="https://daily.jstor.org/the-chemist-whose-work-was-stolen-from-her/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Harry T. Hollmann&lt;/a&gt;, who asked for her help in addressing the treatment of leprosy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many physicians at the time relied on oils extracted from the chaulmoogra tree&lt;em&gt; (Hydnocarpus wightianus)&lt;/em&gt;, but the preparations were unpredictable and sometimes irritating to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crafting-a-new-solution"&gt;Crafting a new solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;She discovered that chaulmoogra seeds contain fatty acids that show potential against the bacteria that cause leprosy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By converting these fatty acids into &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/ethyl-ester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ethyl esters&lt;/a&gt;, she made the preparation easier to inject into patients, which improved their ability to absorb the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People called it the “Ball Method,” recognizing her pioneering step in making an ancient plant medically relevant. Doctors at Kalihi Hospital in Hawaii reported favorable outcomes in patients who had previously struggled with conventional remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tragic-end-and-near-forgotten-credit"&gt;Tragic end and near-forgotten credit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 1916, she inhaled toxic laboratory fumes while preparing materials for her experiments, an accident that quickly turned fatal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She died on December 31, 1916, at just 24 years old, with little public acknowledgment of her groundbreaking developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arthur L. Dean, her academic supervisor, continued the project without clearly mentioning her involvement or her scientific process. Dr. Hollmann stepped in and ensured that her valuable contribution would be recognized in official records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-remembered-legacy-of-alice-ball"&gt;Remembered legacy of Alice Ball&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2025/02/28/alice-ball-day-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; installed a plaque beside a &lt;a href="https://www.osgf.org/blog/2021/2/10/alice-ball-and-chaulmoogra-oil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chaulmoogra tree&lt;/a&gt; to honor her lasting influence. She also received a posthumous award called the Medal of Distinction in 2007, reflecting a gradual correction of history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small satellite named “&lt;a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/11/long-march-6-lofts-ten-argentinian-satellites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alice&lt;/a&gt;” was launched in November 2020, as a way of paying tribute to her achievements from beyond Earth’s boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That modern gesture reminded many in the scientific community to revisit her role in early Hansen’s disease treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-broader-impact"&gt;A broader impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once antibiotics became widely available in the 1940s, the “Ball Method” fell out of common use. Yet historians note that her approach offered one of the first genuine options for people facing severe nerve damage and social stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her achievement stands among the work of other African American pioneers in science, an often underrecognized group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many faced discrimination, individuals like NASA mathematician &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/melba-roy-mouton-mathematician/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Melba Roy Mouton&lt;/a&gt; proved that diverse expertise can break through restrictive barriers, even in top research agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alice-ball-as-an-inspiration"&gt;Alice Ball as an inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern experts see her technique as a remarkable blend of traditional botanical knowledge and chemical resourcefulness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story sparks fresh discussions on the relevance of natural products in managing diseases worldwide, especially in light of the current trend in increasing &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2954574/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her path also turns the spotlight on the importance of crediting researchers, especially when they are marginalized by social structures. In her short life, she managed to merge academic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nematodes-use-chemistry-to-survive-and-communicate/"&gt;chemistry&lt;/a&gt; and pressing medical priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ongoing-lessons"&gt;Ongoing lessons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The desire to help others propelled Alice Ball, even though her name was overshadowed for a time by more prominent figures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People study her story to appreciate how determination and focus can reshape the way we view medical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though chaulmoogra oil is less common now, her idea of transforming thick extracts into more workable solutions still guides pharmaceutical research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts to refine plant-derived treatments often mirror her resourceful approach that involved integrating new technology with older remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead"&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ball’s journey reminds us that life can be brief, but well-targeted &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dark-oxygen-discovery-deep-ocean-rocks-upends-centuries-of-scientific-beliefs/"&gt;scientific&lt;/a&gt; contributions can echo for decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her ability to solve a critical challenge illustrates how observation, laboratory methods, and curiosity can make a difference in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who appreciate her contributions argue that she belongs among the prominent names in medical history, alongside other innovators who expanded treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historians agree that her background and perseverance enrich the broader narrative of global scientific progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information about Alice Ball’s contribution is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0738081X22001663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clinics in Dermatology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;

capital.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Bronx has the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14683527/alzheimers-rises-25th-years-people-diagnosed.html"&gt;highest rate of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; in the nation, tied with Baltimore and Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; One in six adults over 65 in the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-b840bab0-2b60-11f0-992a-73c158b7b47f" class=""&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; borough are diagnosed with Alzheimer's, compared to around one in 10 nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers believe the Bronx became an Alzheimer's hotspot due to its long history of poverty rates well above the national average and a large minority population that has historically been more likely to be struck by the disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The area also has New York City's highest rate of food insecurity, leading residents to turn to ultraprocessed foods shown to induce harmful inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthcare providers in the Bronx have now launched a four-week pilot program to emulate Ikaria, Greece, a small island in the Aegean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Bronx, pictured here, has the highest Alzheimer's rate in the country, tied with Baltimore and Miami&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The island of 8,300 is one of the world's five Blue Zones, areas where residents regularly live well into their 80s, 90s and even 100. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of three Ikarians, for example, live past age 90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One man named &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-12320521/Greek-man-cheats-death-45-years-living-blue-zone.html"&gt;Stamatis Moraitis&lt;/a&gt;, who was born on Ikaria but moved to the US for work, was given a death sentence lung cancer diagnosis in 1976 and just nine months to live. After moving back home to Ikaria, he survived another 45 years until age 98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Residents of the Bronx, in comparison, tend to live to 81, still more than the national average but the lowest out of all five New York City boroughs. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Bronx program, dubbed the 'Blue Zones Challenge,' has recruited 100 Bronx residents of varying ages, races and backgrounds to follow in the footsteps of Ikarians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only enrollment requirement was living in the Bronx, and participants were encouraged to eat more foods aligned with the Mediterranean diet like salmon and arugula. They then were tasked with journaling their habits for four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts running the program told DailyMail.com the goal isn't to completely reverse the risk of Alzheimer's in just a month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, they hope it will help residents adopt long-term healthy habits shown to combat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Edward Cisek, chief research, grants and evaluation officer at CaringKind, one of the two organizations in charge of the Blue Zones Challenge, told this website: 'It's not expected huge changes are going to happen in four weeks. It's to set residents up for success.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The program will run through May 27, 2025, and the team will unveil the findings next month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team is looking to find if the majority of the 100 participants are able to experience notable changes like losing weight, having more energy or improvements in chronic conditions like diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They hope the program may inspire larger initiatives reaching the rest of New York City. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 7million Americans over age 65 have Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Alzheimer's Association, New York state has the third-highest percentage of over-65s with Alzheimer's disease at nearly 13  percent, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12542001/America-Maryland-Alzheimers-disease.html"&gt;trailing only behind Washington DC and Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This adds up to roughly 427,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Blue Zones' are places lauded as longevity hotspots with low rates of chronic diseases and significant amounts of people living well into their 90s and beyond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the Bronx, 17 percent of adults over 65 - about 35,700 - have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The national rate is 11 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a 2023 report, Alzheimer's Association researchers said the higher rates could be due to the demographics in the Bronx. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest Census data shows 57 percent of residents are Hispanic and 28 percent are Black, more than any other New York county. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both of these groups have the highest rates of Alzheimer's disease nationally. The Alzheimer's Association reports Black Americans over 65 are more than twice as likely as their white peers to be struck by the condition, and Hispanics are 1.5 times more likely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent research shows this could be due to Black and Hispanic populations having higher rates of cardiovascular conditions that affect the blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart disease can damage blood vessels and reduce the amount of blood that flows to the brain. Over time, this kills off brain tissues and cells, leading to dementia, particularly vascular dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diabetes, which is twice as common in Black adults, also weakens blood vessels in the brain and leads to inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Socioeconomic status may also be a factor in the Bronx's wave of Alzheimer's disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Bronx is one of America's most impoverished urban counties and the poorest in New York state, with 28 percent of residents living below the poverty line. Nationwide, 11 percent of Americans live in poverty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The median household income in the Bronx in 2022 was $47,260, about 41 percent less than $80,610 nationally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers behind the Blue Zones Challenge in the Bronx are aiming to emulate the habits of Ikaria, Greece (pictured here), where rates of dementia are significantly lower&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These factors are more likely to lead residents to turn toward cheap, ultraprocessed foods loaded with saturated fats, sugars and artificial additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These foods have been shown to increase inflammation and oxidative stress, an imbalance between disease-fighting antioxidants and harmful free radicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Free radicals attack cell DNA and promote the growth of toxic amyloid-beta and tau proteins shown to cause Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Ikaria, meanwhile, residents over age 85 have a one in 10 chance of developing Alzheimer's disease. That's the same risk for Americans 20 years younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time the average US adult reaches 85, they are three times more likely to develop the disease than an 85-year-old in Ikaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ikaria also has about half America's rate of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is largely because Ikarians traditionally follow the Mediterranean diet, which has been hailed as the healthiest eating plan in the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet emphasizes vegetables, dark leafy greens, olive oil, avocadoes, whole grains and nuts and seeds. These foods are rich in nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce levels of harmful inflammation and protect neurons from damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23481688/#:~:text=Omega%2D3%20fatty%20acids%20enhance,microglia%20and%20decrease%20inflammatory%20markers"&gt;Journal of Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/a&gt; also suggested omega-3s reduce levels of amyloid-beta and tau proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ikaria's long life expectancy may also be due to most people living a more relaxed lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To shift the Bronx's health closer toward Ikaria, the Blue Zones Challenge emphasizes lifestyle changes like choosing foods more closely aligned with the Mediterranean diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eleonora Tornatore-Mikesh, president and CEO of CaringKind, points toward a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39096926/"&gt;2024 Lancet study&lt;/a&gt; that round addressing 14 lifestyle factors lowered the risk of dementia by about 40 percent. These included addressing diet, obesity, diabetes and physical inactivity. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Anderson Torres, who is helping run the Blue Zones Challenge, is also participating in the program. He said he has lost weight and has had fewer blood sugar spikes related to his type 2 diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told DailyMail.com that while certain factors like genetic predisposition can't easily be reversed, the Blue Zones Challenge focuses on factors that are within the average person's grasp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'This is the portion you can control: lifestyle. We can't fix all things, but we know lifestyle changes can impact good healthcare.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only requirement to sign up for the challenge was being a resident from the Bronx. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Anderson Torres, CEO of Bronx-based elderly care organization RAIN Total Care who is also a participant in the challenge, told DailyMail.com because Alzheimer's is so prevalent in the area that the team didn't need to specifically seek out a particular group of people for this initial study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By being from the Bronx, we are all at risk,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 100 participants enrolled in the study were told to download a journaling app and keep track of everything they ate, as well as habits like exercising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They weren't given specific instructions but were instead told to be more intentional with their habits. For example, instead of choosing fried chicken, opt for grilled. Participants are also encouraged to add more dark, leafy greens and healthy fats to their meals and suggest their peers try the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These lifestyle changes work best when you do them with other people,' Dr Cisek said.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tornatore-Mikesh told this website the team chose four weeks because research suggests that's how long it takes to create a habit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hope, she said, is to lay the groundwork for participants to make longer-term changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Torres, who treats many Bronx-based patients with Alzheimer's, is participating in the challenge himself. He said that while he has just under three weeks left, small habits like weighing himself every day have caused him to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And as a type 2 diabetic, he has noticed fewer blood sugar spikes since swapping out fried foods for healthier choices like arugula and lean meats.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the other 99 participants experience similar improvements and can start forming similar habits, the researchers plan to expand the efforts to the rest of New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tornatore-Mikesh said: 'I believe this is just the beginning. I want to go for a full Blue Zone.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 16:03:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>北卡罗来纳州妈妈加入突破性的癌症研究，以保护她的女儿- WRAL.com | NC mom joins groundbreaking cancer study to protect her daughters - WRAL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxPZkdrRHFSUW9FbnZ5MTQ2VkRQcno4cVBzdE5lYzUxdjBXZHl2RkllSXRVdUZrNDRRMzdfRFRlYWtIT3BYRGFKc2g0WktiaE9haWd3UXZqUV9tNlpYU09PTFoyOFY2azZ0RmM1dHhSSmRtZTVxVGE2V3d3U2FDOE0yVEVRMTVRSjNuaXpZcFAwcEhlUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;
					
						&lt;p&gt;This Mother’s Day, Samantha McCoy isn’t just asking for
flowers. She’s asking for progress. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The Johnston County mom is one of the North Carolinians enrolled
in the groundbreaking &lt;a href="https://voices.cancer.org/"&gt;VOICES of Black Women
Study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always wanted to be a part of anything that’s going to
help, especially my children,” McCoy said. “I have daughters. Anything that is
going to hopefully make an advancement, so they don’t have to hear the words,
‘You have cancer.’”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;VOICES&lt;/i&gt; study by the American Cancer Society (ACS)
aims to uncover why Black women are more likely to die from cancer and develop
more aggressive forms of the disease. It is the largest study of its kind in U.S. history.
The plan is to follow 100,000 women between 25-55 years old with no prior
cancer history for the next 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Black women have not had an opportunity in medical science
to share their stories and share their experiences,” shared cancer
epidemiologist Lauren McCullough. “We really wanted to hear their voices.” &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;McCullough, co-principal investigator of the study, said the
name &lt;i&gt;VOICES&lt;/i&gt; holds multiple meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“In the African American community, I think our voices have
always been the way we’ve passed down information. Whether it’s through song or
storytelling, it really is sort of integral to our culture,” said McCullough.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/mother-daughter-cancer-study-black-women-may-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/mother-daughter-cancer-study-black-women-may-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Participants are asked to complete two 30-minute
questionnaires twice each year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The survey asks women about a range of topics – ranging from
doctor visits and diagnoses, to income, family dynamics and social habits.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We really felt having a mixed methods approach where we
have both the hard numbers and data, paralleled with women’s open-ended
responses to questions, would be the best way to really understand what the
data is showing us,” said McCullough.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The study also asks women about feelings of stress and
anxiety. Researchers note emotional health has been strongly linked to physical
wellbeing. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“On the airplane, they always say if the oxygen mask comes
down you have to put yours on first before you help the other person,” said
McCoy. “As women, we have to take care of ourselves first so we can help our
family members, and a lot of us don’t do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/mother-daughter-cancer-study-black-women-may-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;McCullough explained the questions seek to uncover under-researched
links between environmental and social determinants of health, and cancer incidences
and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“What sets &lt;i&gt;VOICES&lt;/i&gt; apart, I think, from previous studies
is that we are attuned to some of those social and structural barriers,” said
McCullough. “We’re asking questions that may be uncomfortable. We’re asking
about experiences with racism and discrimination. We’re asking about
generational wealth.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;ACS data shows just under 3,500 women have enrolled in the
study nationwide, fewer than 200 of them from North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyportal.cancer.org/enroll/voices"&gt;Black
women from all fifty states and Washington D.C. are encouraged to enroll online.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;McCoy hopes sharing her story will inspire other moms to
join the cause and fuel efforts to protect children like her three daughters, Carolyn, Deion and Madison. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It’s super easy. If you’re on social media, you’ve got time
to do this,” said McCoy. “Let’s do the research, let’s put the time and effort
into it, let’s be part of the study and let’s find a cure.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She added, “Any study that is going to be make it easier to
get treatment, to provide studies that we can make advancements, to figure out
what’s going on, and to be able to provide for everybody regardless of age,
income and race – I’m all for.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In North Carolina, it’s estimated that 71,320 new cancers
will be diagnosed this year, along with an estimated 20,910 deaths, according
to the ACS.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Breast, lung, and colorectal cancers are the most diagnosed in
women, with prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers impacting the most men. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The ACS reports more North Carolinians die from lung cancer than from any other cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

This detailed map, created using cryo-electron microscopy, reveals how sweeteners bind to a key receptor component, TAS1R2, which resembles a Venus flytrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery could enable the development of new molecules that better regulate or reduce sugar cravings, potentially helping combat obesity and diabetes. Unlike current artificial sweeteners, which were discovered by chance and often fail to curb sugar desire, this structural breakthrough offers a rational path to designing better alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Breakthrough:&lt;/strong&gt; First high-resolution map (2.8 angstroms) of the human sweet taste receptor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sweet Binding Pocket:&lt;/strong&gt; Identifies how molecules like sucralose and aspartame bind to trigger sweetness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; May lead to better sugar substitutes and insights into metabolic health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Zuckerman Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our attraction to sugar has grown to an unhealthy level. The average person in the United States now consumes more than 100 pounds of the sweet stuff every year, up from 18 pounds in 1800.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With new research published May 7, in &lt;em&gt;Cell,&lt;/em&gt; Columbia University scientists have taken a major step toward dealing with this public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109714"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman eating a sugar cube." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The new work maps the structure of the human sweet taste receptor in unprecedented detail, to a resolution as good as 2.8 angstroms. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, they have mapped the 3-D structure of the human sweet taste receptor, the molecular machine that allows us to taste sweet things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could lead to the discovery of new regulators of the receptor that would significantly alter our attraction to and appetite for sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The leading role that sugar plays in obesity cannot be overlooked,” said study co-first author Juen Zhang, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Charles Zuker, PhD, at Columbia’s Zuckerman Institute and at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The artificial sweeteners that we use today to replace sugar just don’t meaningfully change our desire for sugar. Now that we know what the receptor looks like, we might be able to design something better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sweet receptors on our tongue can detect a large number of different chemicals that taste sweet, from common table sugar (also known as sucrose) to antimicrobial enzymes in chicken eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other receptors—for bitter, sour, or other tastes—our sweet sensors evolved to not be very sensitive. This helps us focus on sugar-rich foods for energy, and drives a need for a lot of sweets to satisfy our sweet tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determining the structure of the human sweet receptor is key to comprehending how it helps us detect sweet taste, fundamentally advancing our understanding of taste perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 20 years ago, Dr. Zuker and his colleagues uncovered the genes behind the mammalian sweet taste receptor. This landmark work revealed its chemical formula, but until now no one knew its precise shape, much like how knowing a cake’s recipe will not tell you what the pastry will look like when finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without this knowledge, understanding the molecular basis of sweet detection to rationally design ways to regulate the function of this essential receptor has been a challenge, said Dr. Zuker, in whose laboratory this new work was also carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “All the artificial sweeteners that we use today were either discovered by accident or based on known sweet-tasting molecules,” said study co-author Brian Wang, a research assistant in the Zuker lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a result, most artificial sweeteners have drawbacks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work maps the structure of the human sweet taste receptor in unprecedented detail, to a resolution as good as 2.8 angstroms. In comparison, the smallest atom, hydrogen, is slightly more than 1 angstrom wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took the researchers innovative approaches and about three years to map the human sweet taste receptor’s structure, in large part because it proved difficult to grow this protein on cells in lab dishes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just getting the purified protein we needed to map the structure took more than 150 different preparations over the course of three years,” said study co-first author Zhengyuan Lu, a doctoral student at the Zuker lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists then used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to analyze the human sweet taste receptor. This technique fires beams of electrons at molecules that have been frozen in solution, helping researchers capture snapshots of those molecules from different perspectives, from which they can reconstruct their three-dimensional structures at the atomic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of particular importance, cryo-EM revealed the receptor’s binding pocket: the cavity where sweet things stick and trigger the set of reactions that drive our strong appetite for sweets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Defining the binding pocket of this receptor very accurately is absolutely vital to understanding its function,” said study co-author Anthony Fitzpatrick, PhD, a principal investigator at Columbia’s Zuckerman Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By knowing its exact shape, we can see why sweeteners attach to it, and how to make or find better molecules that activate the receptor or regulate its function,” added Dr. Fitzpatrick, who is also an assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biophysics at Columbia’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human sweet taste receptor consists of two main halves. One of these, named TAS1R2, possesses the binding pocket, a component resembling a Venus flytrap. Knowing the structure of this part may also help us understand why people differ in how sensitive they are to sweets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists mapped the receptor’s structure as it bound to two of the most commonly used artificial sweeteners, aspartame and sucralose. These are, respectively, 200 and 600 times sweeter than sucrose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then systematically altered tiny parts of the receptor. This helped shed light on the role each of these parts play in binding onto the sweeteners, said study co-author Ruihuan Yu, a doctoral student at the Zuker lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to move our understanding of science forward to be able to help people,” said study co-author Andrew Chang, a research technician at the Fitzpatrick lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the human sweet taste receptor is found mostly on taste buds in the mouth, Dr. Zhang noted it is also scattered throughout the body, where it may play a role in the function of organs such as the pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, the new map of this receptor’s structure might support research investigating our metabolism, as well as in disorders such as diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#19777c6e6a596370377a76756c747b7078377c7d6c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zuckerman Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://zi.columbia.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zuckerman Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Zuckerman Communications – Zuckerman Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.04.021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Structure of Human Sweetness&lt;/a&gt;” by Andrew Chang et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Structure of Human Sweetness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, the detection and ultimately the perception of sweetness begin in the oral cavity, where taste receptor cells (TRCs) dedicated to sweet-sensing interact with sugars, artificial sweeteners, and other sweet-tasting chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human sweet TRCs express on their cell surface a sweet receptor that initiates the cascade of signaling events responsible for our strong attraction to sweet stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we describe the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human sweet receptor bound to two of the most widely used artificial sweeteners—sucralose and aspartame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results reveal the structural basis for sweet detection, provide insights into how a single receptor mediates all our responses to such a wide range of sweet-tasting compounds, and open up unique possibilities for designing a generation of taste modulators informed by the structure of the human receptor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 15:34:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1oakdRdDltTlVILUt5QTlsQlRBcnRZLWd3ZG9NUGU4NmtoMm1BbUpxb1VGaG9PeDJ1YTdVM05YbTJzc3oyMWR1WHBfak5KcllBcFV0M1I2TGd1cTVQMmR1cF9FaWl6clNXZDRXNUlURDlHOEdMdjBPYQ</guid></item><item><title>8位意大利物理学家制作了完美的cacio e pepe吗？我测试了他们的实验以找出答案- CNN | Did 8 Italian physicists make the perfect cacio e pepe?

            Few things are as impressive to dinner party guests as a perfectly executed à la minute pasta dish.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaf8loc003l3b6mzlcoo0vo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a Roman-born foodie, I would argue that cacio e pepe, a Roman pasta recipe that is as delicious and simple as it is finicky, is a bold menu choice for the novice cook.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700053b6m1gqecjsh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The name says it all: pasta, cacio (cheese) and pepe (pepper). That’s it. That’s the recipe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700063b6m58o4lg1b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is no margin for error with just pasta, Pecorino Romano cheese, and black pepper,” Michele Casadei Massari, CEO and executive chef of Lucciola Italian Restaurant in Manhattan, told CNN via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700073b6moc7ae82r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The main challenge lies in achieving a stable emulsion: If the cheese is overheated or the starch-water balance is wrong, the sauce will separate,” Massari said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700083b6maqetauzk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When that happens, the pecorino forms a gloopy cheesy mess, sticking to everything but the noodles — sad and naked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700093b6mru4lvpwx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So, how can one reliably avoid unpleasant dinnertime disasters? Either by practicing a lot — and inevitably making mistakes in the process, as I have — or by using science to guide the way.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000a3b6mc6ow50ts@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Eight Italian physicists collaborated to crack the code of a foolproof cacio e pepe recipe, studying the properties of cheese, starch and water at different temperatures to learn how to replicate a flawless dish every time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000b3b6mdvrzbml6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study was published April 29 in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/37/4/044122/3345324/Phase-behavior-of-Cacio-e-Pepe-sauce" target="_blank"&gt;Physics of Fluids&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000c3b6mf5fihjzo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The magic trick? Adding a precise amount of cornstarch relative to the overall quantity of cheese used, to keep the dreaded clumps at bay.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000d3b6mhzek6xja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When I first heard about the method, the Roman cuisine purist in me was skeptical.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000e3b6mor1cddf4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Too many times, I’ve read cheat sheets for the perfect carbonara dish in which the solution to perfect, non-scrambled-egg sauce is to add cream (please, do not do this). In the interest of objectivity, I had to test the recipe myself and talk to these fellow Italians behind the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000f3b6malreri8u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a conversation in Italian, three of the study authors shared that the research came from their frustration for one too many cacio e pepe dishes gone wrong. Thanks to the group’s familiarity with the concept of “liquid-liquid phase separation,” they knew how to investigate the problem scientifically.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000g3b6mb0y3pg55@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At some point, the eight of us were all at the Max Planck Institute in Dresden (Germany), some as PhD students, some as postdocs,” said study coauthor Daniel Maria Busiello, a statistical physicist at Italy’s University of Padova. At that time, “something we’d often do was cooking Italian recipes, not just for Italians, but for others as well.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000h3b6m5lp3tu36@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Making big batches of cacio e pepe to feed other hungry scientists turned out to be a near-impossible feat. “There were problems with controlling the temperature of the sauce and of the noodles, causing these clumps,” Busiello said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000i3b6mvpf28x6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I remember a time the dish came out inedible. Something clicked then,” said study coauthor Ivan Di Terlizzi, one of the group’s top cooks, and a statistical physicist at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000j3b6mwtdn6m82@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Di Terlizzi approached fellow researcher Giacomo Bartolucci, now a biophysicist at the University of Barcelona in Spain, with a working theory about possible commonalities between the behavior of cacio e pepe sauce and that of aqueous solutions of proteins inside cells. Bartolucci had focused on phase separation and the aggregation of proteins for his doctoral research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000k3b6mqo8k8xbq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The scientists set out to understand whether the cheese and water in this recipe could be scientifically described as “a system that undergoes phase separation at high temperatures,” in Busiello’s words.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000l3b6m4mfatv8r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We had a theoretical framework and a practical problem,” Busiello added.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000m3b6mhrcdq0q0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Innovating on traditional Italian recipes, even on solid scientific grounds, is a high-risk endeavor. Given the touchy subject, the study authors are of course all Italians, by design.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000n3b6mn9cb1xho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If we have to piss off a bunch of people, at least let it be eight Italians who did it,” Di Terlizzi said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000o3b6m5dp67fdm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To investigate the behavior of cacio e pepe sauce under heat, the researchers conducted experiments recreating the cooking process in a controlled setup.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000p3b6mdctlpk25@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We prepared small batches of sauce using precise amounts of cheese, starch, and water, and gradually heated them using a sous vide device to carefully control the temperature,” Di Terlizzi explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000q3b6mkvrder94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At each stage, we took a small sample of the sauce, placed it in a petri dish and photographed it from above to observe how clumps formed. This allowed us to track how changes in temperature and ingredients affected the smoothness of the sauce.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000r3b6m5slp1y01@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers found that the concentration of starch in the sauce is the key factor influencing its stability. If the proportion of starch falls below 1% of the total cheese weight, the cheese will enter what the authors call the “Mozzarella phase” — in which clumps are inescapable and the dish is ruined — at lower temperatures. A 2% to 3% starch-to-cheese ratio yields the best results.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000s3b6mqeyk94ts@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the recipe for two published in the study, the researchers used 5 grams (0.18 ounce) of cornstarch or potato starch dissolved in water, heated up gently to form a gel, then cooled down with more water before being blended with 200 grams (7 ounces) of pecorino cheese.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000t3b6muahwfq8o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sodium citrate, a common additive used to make smooth mac and cheese, also worked well in their recipe, although according to Di Terlizzi it lent the dish a slightly “cheese single” aftertaste.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000u3b6msp8avli0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The scientifically engineered pecorino cream can withstand temperature changes better than the classic cheese-starchy water mixture made with pasta cooking water and can even be reheated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000v3b6mg2tw9qgs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Temperature is in fact another key factor that can make or break the sauce, which has to do with how the proteins in the cheese behave when heated.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000w3b6mha7j8xmp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The sauce is stable if created at low temperatures and the starch bonded with the proteins. If, after that happens, you expose the sauce to high temperatures, proteins can no longer interact,” Di Terlizzi said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000x3b6mzof6u6et@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the emulsion of cheese and starch happens at high temperatures though, “there’s no guarantee that proteins will bond with other proteins, which causes the aggregation, before they bond with the starch.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000y3b6mi87n4xdq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The scientifically optimized recipe will yield solid results for large batches of pasta, as the stable sauce will give you more flexibility dealing with a large volume of piping hot noodles, cooling down more slowly than a smaller batch of pasta would.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000z3b6mzt040x4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When trying the scientifically optimized recipe, don’t throw away all the pasta cooking water! You’ll still need some of it in the final mixing of all ingredients (the “mantecatura” in Italian). Just be careful to let it cool down slightly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700103b6mf9l0w8gu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When I tested the recipe, the instructions felt straightforward, and the process was quick, though it required a few more steps than what I’m used to (such as forming the starch gel on the stove).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700113b6mbx3b73af@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was frankly odd to work with a pecorino cream that felt so smooth — it almost reminded me of a jarred sauce. Nothing changes as far as the pepper goes. Just crack as much of it as you’d like and toast it in a pan to release its aroma.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700123b6m7h2ja6tr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            My husband and I enjoyed the dish. It tasted great, and dealing with a pecorino cream that needs much less babying at the stove and allows for a much less time-sensitive mantecatura is a definite plus. Also, who doesn’t love the idea of a cacio e pepe party for a crowd?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700133b6mw0e27aa8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            My only qualm is that knowing there was starch added in the sauce, my perception of the dish’s mouthfeel was definitely skewed, but that wasn’t the case for my husband.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700143b6m6fkh744e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a proud Roman home cook, my pursuit of a perfect classic cacio e pepe will be a life-long experiment, but the scientifically optimized recipe exceeded my expectations and would be a good initiation for home cooks who have been put off by the dish’s treachery thus far.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700153b6m1pykxwt3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But what exactly makes the traditional way of making this dish, by emulsifying the cheese with pasta cooking water, so challenging?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700163b6my3e7k6t1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s practically impossible to know just how much starch is naturally present in the pasta cooking water, so the success of the crucial emulsion is more of a gamble, but there are tricks to mitigate catastrophe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700173b6m76rvfzf5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One, coming from Massari, is to use less water to boil the pasta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700183b6mhslknx8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For cacio e pepe, I recommend using about 6 to 8 cups of water for 7 ounces of pasta, which translates to a ratio closer to 1 part pasta to 6–7 parts water by weight — significantly less than in traditional pasta cooking,” the chef said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700193b6ml6n5dtcn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A classic rule of thumb for cooking pasta, according to Massari, is to use about 1 quart of water for every 3½ ounces of pasta, and 2 teaspoons of salt.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7001a3b6mee7hp9h1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers, who used an arbitrary 10-to-1 ratio of water to pasta in their experiments, also said that reducing that volume of water by two-thirds generally concentrated the natural pasta starch to a safe degree.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001b3b6m5xcpr6o5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Massari also recommends emulsifying the cheese and pasta water below 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit), which is in line with the new study’s findings on temperature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001c3b6m0m7p0xra@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I first create a cold cheese cream, using finely grated Pecorino and a small amount of the pasta’s starchy cooking water, blending until smooth. Then, I toss the pasta off the heat with the cream and freshly cracked black pepper, adding extra water to adjust the texture,” Massari said. “The result should be a silky, cohesive sauce that clings beautifully to every strand of pasta, not a broken or heavy coating.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001d3b6m7ppm32hm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The natural starch from properly handled pasta is more than sufficient to achieve a creamy, stable, and authentic sauce without compromising the nutritional integrity of the dish,” Massari added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001e3b6muk2hhk1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another chef’s trick to buy you some time while attempting the recipe the traditional way is “pasta regeneration” — which involves partially cooking the pasta for about 70% of its time, immediately shocking it in ice water to stop gelatinization and finishing it later before serving.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001f3b6m40ky176q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This method preserves al dente texture while enhancing the final release of surface starch, which is crucial for stabilizing delicate emulsions,” Massari explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001g3b6my07yo0ng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers said their scientifically optimized recipe has surged to meme status, online and offline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001h3b6mbxdj6vfw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Some social media users were hypercritical about the recipe we proposed, despite it being used before in prestigious restaurants,” Di Terlizzi told CNN. “Overall, I can say that excitement prevailed, especially in the scientific community,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001i3b6mbsdtb5e2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We won’t say we invented the definitive method,” Di Terlizzi said, but this method will save you from ruining good, expensive and hard-to-source pecorino cheese.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001j3b6m2hujmvjh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the researchers, that’s personal: “We’re in Germany. We have that shipped to us all the way from Italy. We can’t just buy it at the store every day,” Di Terlizzi said. “So, when the dish turns out badly, that bothers us.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001k3b6mhj0c9hwe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A big pasta dinner celebrated the publication of the paper, with the researchers preparing at least 4 pounds of pasta for a crowd.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001l3b6mcl1e0pnn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We were on pins and needles because our diners all knew about the experiment — but it worked perfectly,” Busiello said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001m3b6meeorbvkm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartolucci added, “That was our trial by fire.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            This is CNN’s summary of the recipe presented in the study. You can find Pecorino Romano DOP — which stands for Protected Designation of Origin, a certification of a product’s origin and quality assigned by the Italian government and the European Union — and tonnarelli pasta at Italian grocers and online specialty stores.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            • 300 grams (10.6 ounces) pasta, preferably tonnarelli (spaghetti or rigatoni also work well)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001u3b6mi6eux9f2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001w3b6mnddrfz3h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            2. While the water comes to a boil, add peppercorns in a single layer to a dry pan over medium-low heat. Toast until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove pepper from heat immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001x3b6mxv34fw6l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            3. Make the starch gel. In a small saucepan, dissolve the cornstarch by whisking it into 50 grams (3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) cold water. Heat the mixture gently over low heat until it thickens and turns nearly clear. Remove the starch gel from heat and whisk in 100 grams (6 ¾ tablespoons) water to cool. The mixture will return to a liquid state.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001y3b6mq0j3gq23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            4. Make the pecorino cream. Add the starchy water, grated cheese and peppercorns&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine until a smooth cream forms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaf5ypz003j3b6meiw27a7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            5. Cook the pasta according to the package directions until al dente, reserving 237 milliliters (1 cup) of pasta water before draining. Drain the pasta and let cool for up to 1 minute.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d800203b6my6yio35j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            6. Mix the pasta with the sauce, ensuring even coating, and adjust the consistency by gradually adding pasta water as needed. Keep the sauce slightly runny as it tends to thicken as it cools. If needed, the dish can withstand gentle reheating (up to 80 or 90 C, 176 to 194 F) to reach serving temperature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d800213b6mpnrwrod4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            7. Sprinkle with additional grated cheese and pepper and serve immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I recommend using high-quality spaghettoni pasta made from durum wheat semolina, bronze-extruded and slow-dried at low temperatures,” Massari told CNN. “I prefer using Matt, a heritage durum wheat cultivated mainly in Puglia and Sicily.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmacp1wd40000356mmv0i3npc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            1. Bring 6 to 8 cups of lightly salted water to a boil in a large pot. Toast the black pepper in a dry pan over medium-low heat until fragrant. Remove pepper from heat immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8002d3b6mxa4vfkn7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            2. Cook the spaghettoni according to the package directions until slightly al dente, reserving 237 grams (1 cup) of cooking liquid while it’s cooking.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8002e3b6ml2addbdi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            3. While the pasta is cooking, prepare a cold emulsion by mixing grated Pecorino Romano with a small ladle of warm pasta water (ideally under 60 C, or 140 F) in a medium bowl until it forms a creamy base.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8002f3b6myrw3a0fc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            4. Drain the pasta slightly al dente, then transfer it to the pan with the pepper.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8002g3b6m2d5yf488@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            5. Toss the pasta with the Pecorino cream, gradually adjusting with more pasta water to create a glossy, smooth sauce that perfectly coats the noodles. Add more black pepper and cheese before serving. Serve immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Few things are as impressive to dinner party guests as a perfectly executed à la minute pasta dish.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            As a Roman-born foodie, I would argue that cacio e pepe, a Roman pasta recipe that is as delicious and simple as it is finicky, is a bold menu choice for the novice cook.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700053b6m1gqecjsh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The name says it all: pasta, cacio (cheese) and pepe (pepper). That’s it. That’s the recipe.

            “There is no margin for error with just pasta, Pecorino Romano cheese, and black pepper,” Michele Casadei Massari, CEO and executive chef of Lucciola Italian Restaurant in Manhattan, told CNN via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700073b6moc7ae82r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The main challenge lies in achieving a stable emulsion: If the cheese is overheated or the starch-water balance is wrong, the sauce will separate,” Massari said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700083b6maqetauzk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When that happens, the pecorino forms a gloopy cheesy mess, sticking to everything but the noodles — sad and naked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700093b6mru4lvpwx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So, how can one reliably avoid unpleasant dinnertime disasters? Either by practicing a lot — and inevitably making mistakes in the process, as I have — or by using science to guide the way.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000a3b6mc6ow50ts@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Eight Italian physicists collaborated to crack the code of a foolproof cacio e pepe recipe, studying the properties of cheese, starch and water at different temperatures to learn how to replicate a flawless dish every time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000b3b6mdvrzbml6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study was published April 29 in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/37/4/044122/3345324/Phase-behavior-of-Cacio-e-Pepe-sauce" target="_blank"&gt;Physics of Fluids&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000c3b6mf5fihjzo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The magic trick? Adding a precise amount of cornstarch relative to the overall quantity of cheese used, to keep the dreaded clumps at bay.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000d3b6mhzek6xja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When I first heard about the method, the Roman cuisine purist in me was skeptical.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000e3b6mor1cddf4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Too many times, I’ve read cheat sheets for the perfect carbonara dish in which the solution to perfect, non-scrambled-egg sauce is to add cream (please, do not do this). In the interest of objectivity, I had to test the recipe myself and talk to these fellow Italians behind the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000f3b6malreri8u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a conversation in Italian, three of the study authors shared that the research came from their frustration for one too many cacio e pepe dishes gone wrong. Thanks to the group’s familiarity with the concept of “liquid-liquid phase separation,” they knew how to investigate the problem scientifically.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000g3b6mb0y3pg55@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At some point, the eight of us were all at the Max Planck Institute in Dresden (Germany), some as PhD students, some as postdocs,” said study coauthor Daniel Maria Busiello, a statistical physicist at Italy’s University of Padova. At that time, “something we’d often do was cooking Italian recipes, not just for Italians, but for others as well.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000h3b6m5lp3tu36@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Making big batches of cacio e pepe to feed other hungry scientists turned out to be a near-impossible feat. “There were problems with controlling the temperature of the sauce and of the noodles, causing these clumps,” Busiello said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000i3b6mvpf28x6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I remember a time the dish came out inedible. Something clicked then,” said study coauthor Ivan Di Terlizzi, one of the group’s top cooks, and a statistical physicist at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000j3b6mwtdn6m82@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Di Terlizzi approached fellow researcher Giacomo Bartolucci, now a biophysicist at the University of Barcelona in Spain, with a working theory about possible commonalities between the behavior of cacio e pepe sauce and that of aqueous solutions of proteins inside cells. Bartolucci had focused on phase separation and the aggregation of proteins for his doctoral research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000k3b6mqo8k8xbq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The scientists set out to understand whether the cheese and water in this recipe could be scientifically described as “a system that undergoes phase separation at high temperatures,” in Busiello’s words.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000l3b6m4mfatv8r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We had a theoretical framework and a practical problem,” Busiello added.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000m3b6mhrcdq0q0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Innovating on traditional Italian recipes, even on solid scientific grounds, is a high-risk endeavor. Given the touchy subject, the study authors are of course all Italians, by design.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000n3b6mn9cb1xho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If we have to piss off a bunch of people, at least let it be eight Italians who did it,” Di Terlizzi said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000o3b6m5dp67fdm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To investigate the behavior of cacio e pepe sauce under heat, the researchers conducted experiments recreating the cooking process in a controlled setup.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000p3b6mdctlpk25@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We prepared small batches of sauce using precise amounts of cheese, starch, and water, and gradually heated them using a sous vide device to carefully control the temperature,” Di Terlizzi explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000q3b6mkvrder94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At each stage, we took a small sample of the sauce, placed it in a petri dish and photographed it from above to observe how clumps formed. This allowed us to track how changes in temperature and ingredients affected the smoothness of the sauce.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000r3b6m5slp1y01@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers found that the concentration of starch in the sauce is the key factor influencing its stability. If the proportion of starch falls below 1% of the total cheese weight, the cheese will enter what the authors call the “Mozzarella phase” — in which clumps are inescapable and the dish is ruined — at lower temperatures. A 2% to 3% starch-to-cheese ratio yields the best results.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000s3b6mqeyk94ts@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the recipe for two published in the study, the researchers used 5 grams (0.18 ounce) of cornstarch or potato starch dissolved in water, heated up gently to form a gel, then cooled down with more water before being blended with 200 grams (7 ounces) of pecorino cheese.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000t3b6muahwfq8o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sodium citrate, a common additive used to make smooth mac and cheese, also worked well in their recipe, although according to Di Terlizzi it lent the dish a slightly “cheese single” aftertaste.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000u3b6msp8avli0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The scientifically engineered pecorino cream can withstand temperature changes better than the classic cheese-starchy water mixture made with pasta cooking water and can even be reheated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000v3b6mg2tw9qgs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Temperature is in fact another key factor that can make or break the sauce, which has to do with how the proteins in the cheese behave when heated.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000w3b6mha7j8xmp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The sauce is stable if created at low temperatures and the starch bonded with the proteins. If, after that happens, you expose the sauce to high temperatures, proteins can no longer interact,” Di Terlizzi said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000x3b6mzof6u6et@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the emulsion of cheese and starch happens at high temperatures though, “there’s no guarantee that proteins will bond with other proteins, which causes the aggregation, before they bond with the starch.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000y3b6mi87n4xdq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The scientifically optimized recipe will yield solid results for large batches of pasta, as the stable sauce will give you more flexibility dealing with a large volume of piping hot noodles, cooling down more slowly than a smaller batch of pasta would.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000z3b6mzt040x4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When trying the scientifically optimized recipe, don’t throw away all the pasta cooking water! You’ll still need some of it in the final mixing of all ingredients (the “mantecatura” in Italian). Just be careful to let it cool down slightly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700103b6mf9l0w8gu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When I tested the recipe, the instructions felt straightforward, and the process was quick, though it required a few more steps than what I’m used to (such as forming the starch gel on the stove).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700113b6mbx3b73af@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was frankly odd to work with a pecorino cream that felt so smooth — it almost reminded me of a jarred sauce. Nothing changes as far as the pepper goes. Just crack as much of it as you’d like and toast it in a pan to release its aroma.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700123b6m7h2ja6tr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            My husband and I enjoyed the dish. It tasted great, and dealing with a pecorino cream that needs much less babying at the stove and allows for a much less time-sensitive mantecatura is a definite plus. Also, who doesn’t love the idea of a cacio e pepe party for a crowd?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700133b6mw0e27aa8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            My only qualm is that knowing there was starch added in the sauce, my perception of the dish’s mouthfeel was definitely skewed, but that wasn’t the case for my husband.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700143b6m6fkh744e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a proud Roman home cook, my pursuit of a perfect classic cacio e pepe will be a life-long experiment, but the scientifically optimized recipe exceeded my expectations and would be a good initiation for home cooks who have been put off by the dish’s treachery thus far.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700153b6m1pykxwt3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But what exactly makes the traditional way of making this dish, by emulsifying the cheese with pasta cooking water, so challenging?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700163b6my3e7k6t1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s practically impossible to know just how much starch is naturally present in the pasta cooking water, so the success of the crucial emulsion is more of a gamble, but there are tricks to mitigate catastrophe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700173b6m76rvfzf5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One, coming from Massari, is to use less water to boil the pasta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700183b6mhslknx8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For cacio e pepe, I recommend using about 6 to 8 cups of water for 7 ounces of pasta, which translates to a ratio closer to 1 part pasta to 6–7 parts water by weight — significantly less than in traditional pasta cooking,” the chef said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700193b6ml6n5dtcn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A classic rule of thumb for cooking pasta, according to Massari, is to use about 1 quart of water for every 3½ ounces of pasta, and 2 teaspoons of salt.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7001a3b6mee7hp9h1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers, who used an arbitrary 10-to-1 ratio of water to pasta in their experiments, also said that reducing that volume of water by two-thirds generally concentrated the natural pasta starch to a safe degree.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001b3b6m5xcpr6o5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Massari also recommends emulsifying the cheese and pasta water below 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit), which is in line with the new study’s findings on temperature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001c3b6m0m7p0xra@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I first create a cold cheese cream, using finely grated Pecorino and a small amount of the pasta’s starchy cooking water, blending until smooth. Then, I toss the pasta off the heat with the cream and freshly cracked black pepper, adding extra water to adjust the texture,” Massari said. “The result should be a silky, cohesive sauce that clings beautifully to every strand of pasta, not a broken or heavy coating.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001d3b6m7ppm32hm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The natural starch from properly handled pasta is more than sufficient to achieve a creamy, stable, and authentic sauce without compromising the nutritional integrity of the dish,” Massari added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001e3b6muk2hhk1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another chef’s trick to buy you some time while attempting the recipe the traditional way is “pasta regeneration” — which involves partially cooking the pasta for about 70% of its time, immediately shocking it in ice water to stop gelatinization and finishing it later before serving.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001f3b6m40ky176q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This method preserves al dente texture while enhancing the final release of surface starch, which is crucial for stabilizing delicate emulsions,” Massari explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001g3b6my07yo0ng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers said their scientifically optimized recipe has surged to meme status, online and offline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001h3b6mbxdj6vfw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Some social media users were hypercritical about the recipe we proposed, despite it being used before in prestigious restaurants,” Di Terlizzi told CNN. “Overall, I can say that excitement prevailed, especially in the scientific community,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001i3b6mbsdtb5e2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We won’t say we invented the definitive method,” Di Terlizzi said, but this method will save you from ruining good, expensive and hard-to-source pecorino cheese.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001j3b6m2hujmvjh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the researchers, that’s personal: “We’re in Germany. We have that shipped to us all the way from Italy. We can’t just buy it at the store every day,” Di Terlizzi said. “So, when the dish turns out badly, that bothers us.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001k3b6mhj0c9hwe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A big pasta dinner celebrated the publication of the paper, with the researchers preparing at least 4 pounds of pasta for a crowd.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001l3b6mcl1e0pnn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We were on pins and needles because our diners all knew about the experiment — but it worked perfectly,” Busiello said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001m3b6meeorbvkm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartolucci added, “That was our trial by fire.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            This is CNN’s summary of the recipe presented in the study. You can find Pecorino Romano DOP — which stands for Protected Designation of Origin, a certification of a product’s origin and quality assigned by the Italian government and the European Union — and tonnarelli pasta at Italian grocers and online specialty stores.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            • 300 grams (10.6 ounces) pasta, preferably tonnarelli (spaghetti or rigatoni also work well)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001u3b6mi6eux9f2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Instructions&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001w3b6mnddrfz3h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            2. While the water comes to a boil, add peppercorns in a single layer to a dry pan over medium-low heat. Toast until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove pepper from heat immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001x3b6mxv34fw6l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            3. Make the starch gel. In a small saucepan, dissolve the cornstarch by whisking it into 50 grams (3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) cold water. Heat the mixture gently over low heat until it thickens and turns nearly clear. Remove the starch gel from heat and whisk in 100 grams (6 ¾ tablespoons) water to cool. The mixture will return to a liquid state.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001y3b6mq0j3gq23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            4. Make the pecorino cream. Add the starchy water, grated cheese and peppercorns&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine until a smooth cream forms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaf5ypz003j3b6meiw27a7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            5. Cook the pasta according to the package directions until al dente, reserving 237 milliliters (1 cup) of pasta water before draining. Drain the pasta and let cool for up to 1 minute.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d800203b6my6yio35j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            6. Mix the pasta with the sauce, ensuring even coating, and adjust the consistency by gradually adding pasta water as needed. Keep the sauce slightly runny as it tends to thicken as it cools. If needed, the dish can withstand gentle reheating (up to 80 or 90 C, 176 to 194 F) to reach serving temperature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            7. Sprinkle with additional grated cheese and pepper and serve immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I recommend using high-quality spaghettoni pasta made from durum wheat semolina, bronze-extruded and slow-dried at low temperatures,” Massari told CNN. “I prefer using Matt, a heritage durum wheat cultivated mainly in Puglia and Sicily.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            1. Bring 6 to 8 cups of lightly salted water to a boil in a large pot. Toast the black pepper in a dry pan over medium-low heat until fragrant. Remove pepper from heat immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8002d3b6mxa4vfkn7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            2. Cook the spaghettoni according to the package directions until slightly al dente, reserving 237 grams (1 cup) of cooking liquid while it’s cooking.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8002e3b6ml2addbdi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            3. While the pasta is cooking, prepare a cold emulsion by mixing grated Pecorino Romano with a small ladle of warm pasta water (ideally under 60 C, or 140 F) in a medium bowl until it forms a creamy base.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8002f3b6myrw3a0fc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            4. Drain the pasta slightly al dente, then transfer it to the pan with the pepper.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            5. Toss the pasta with the Pecorino cream, gradually adjusting with more pasta water to create a glossy, smooth sauce that perfectly coats the noodles. Add more black pepper and cheese before serving. Serve immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Westchester County Department of Health confirmed on Friday, May 9 that an indoor/outdoor cat that lived in Katonah died on Wednesday, May 7, and later tested positive for rabies. Officials say the cat was an average-sized white tabby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="e-instream-video-container" js-instream-video-container=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials did not specify exactly where the cat was found but said they would release more information as it becomes available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="b-banner m-mobile-rectangle" data-position="mobile_rectangle" data-testid="mobile_rectangle" js-banner=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As it was an indoor/outdoor cat, there is no way to tell exactly where the cat was while outside," health officials said in a social media comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities are urging anyone who may have come into contact with the cat—or whose pets may have—to immediately call the health department at 914-813-5000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you, a family member, or your pet may have had any contact with this cat, call right away,” the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="e-nativo-container" js-nativo=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="b-banner m-mobile-rectangle" data-position="mobile_rectangle" data-testid="mobile_rectangle" js-banner=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabies is 100% preventable with early treatment, but once symptoms appear in humans or animals, the disease is always fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure to rabies can occur through bites or contact with the saliva of an infected animal. Post-exposure treatment is highly effective when started before symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent rabies, health officials urge residents to never feed, handle, or approach wild or stray animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="b-banner m-mobile-rectangle" data-position="mobile_rectangle" data-testid="mobile_rectangle" js-banner=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Biochemist Rhonda Patrick says intensity wins over length when it comes to taking care of heart or efficient blood sugar regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing her views on Lewis Howes' School of Greatness Podcast, Patrick says people should opt for 10 minutes of gruelling workout than 10,000 steps of leisurely walk if they want to make better utilization of their time, and improve glucose regulation and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that 10,000 steps should be replaced with 10 minutes of vigorous exercise a day," she said in the interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People may feel long-duration walks could be better for fitness, but the biochemist says slow walking may bring limited benefits compared to intense exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It comes down to [the fact that] you can walk slow, right?" she told Howes. "Also, do you know how long it takes? It takes a long time—like an hour and a half," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, 10 minutes of vigorous exercise, like sprints or cycling intervals, can help boost blood glucose regulation and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of &lt;keyword id="24430337" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="exercise-snacks" source="keywords"&gt;exercise snacks&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quoting a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38629807/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Patrick said that 10 bodyweight squats every 45 minutes during an 8.5-hour period of sitting improves blood sugar regulation better than a single 30-minute walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking about 'exercise snacks' or brief, intense bursts of activity is an effective way to avoid health risks linked with our inactive lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examined how different patterns of muscle activity while interrupting prolonged sitting affect blood sugar control in overweight and obese men. Compared to 8.5 hours of uninterrupted sitting, all active interruptions, one continuous 30-minute walk, or 3-minute walks or squats every 45 minutes led to better post-meal glucose control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequent walking or squatting was significantly more effective than a single 30-minute walk. The improvements were linked to increased muscle activity, especially in the quadriceps and glutes. In short, frequent, short bursts of movement, even as brief as 3 minutes, help regulate blood sugar more effectively than one long session of walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Intense exercise vs slow walking: What improves VO2 max&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VO2 max, or maximal oxygen consumption, is a measure of how much oxygen your body can use during exercise. Slow or casual walking doesn't have a major impact on VO2 max. Vigorous exercise on the other hand could drastically improve this measure which can improve your cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a good VO2 max reduces your risk of death from all causes to a significant extent. People with low VO2 max could have a mortality rate lower than those who smoked, had blood pressure, or diabetes, according to Patrick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unique benefits of walking&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many, however, would still say that walking is the best exercise as it supports joint mobility and strengthens muscles without the strain of high-impact exercise, which makes it ideal for people of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular walking also improves digestion, boosts immune function, aids in maintaining a healthy weight, and enhances sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mentally, walking, especially in nature, can reduce stress, elevate mood, improve creativity, and even lower the risk of anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Indoor walking workout: Complete 1000 steps in 10 mins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 14:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwJBVV95cUxPdnpLaTVyRFBOSG9yRHFmNDNLX0ZzazlwSXNNcFZNRk12M2dNcGNJQjJPaktzN0p4Nm5rT25heVhIVjBjRFZwemdmSENwWTg0OEJlelFhTUNEbWZmdkppekFlaEsyUElSWC04TG5wVDE1VndfSTREVDJQcE1YVzVDbDFMeHFsWFF3T1R2aXdVZW90bTU4X093eWdCTGRkdVhlT2IwdUdNMTlfbDYxUDI3N0FEenhtWWVTaWoyeWltYlM2UmN6aWxQcDZLRXZDaDJUUkd0bmJPZzZHUzBNd28tU3V1ck5pMTJXbjJFeS1MVThXVkcycHMyOF9Kd1gwZkZFS0lWbldUdjV2NkRJSS1PRENqTndrbnfSAZwCQVVfeXFMUGtCODgyLVhsYkpHQ0ljd2d4R2VfT1A4ZHdJLTI3cTNheFJoZTFZVXFQUWhURm5aenJ3aktYQk1hRDJYSjhyTm1GaU03TVM3MkUtbks1NWZISk9ZUV9zRnlHc0NheGhIRVltUVJBZnl0b3BEdUlHMmVwdGpidXhXNFA0WlVfM0w5bWVpZmFtY05LcGl3YVVrU3ZpMWo2Y1Y1N28yYXRoUFlybWl1LW1KRjQ2OGgxeEZTVDg0U2lpMTh1U2FRRDczNGdMRGNOZ1JkQk1mNVVJUHZEb0d3d0liQU1DWXhEWnVHTm92T3FLeTBPQUNjZEQ0NUFvT0k2bnlwa1ZveVlud01PQ1l5bndKc3dhc0pNRzJsNFQzX0g</guid></item><item><title>FDA批准首个代替子宫颈抹片检查的家庭替代品--《纽约时报》 | F.D.A.

But the at-home version could help women who have trouble finding, traveling to or making time for an in-person appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The approval is a result of a process that began with the discovery decades ago&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that the human papillomavirus, commonly known as HPV, causes almost all cervical cancer cases, and that people who don’t have the virus are at virtually no risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Armed with that information, many providers started testing Pap smear samples for HPV in addition to analyzing cervical cells under a microscope. Some medical authorities shifted to recommend HPV testing as the primary screening method, which opened the door for vaginal tests, because the virus can be detected in vaginal as well as cervical cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Cervical cancer experts told The New York Times that the evidence for at-home testing was strong, and studies show it to be about as accurate as Pap smears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
