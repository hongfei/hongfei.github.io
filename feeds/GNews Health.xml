Seasonal vaccination is also a critical public health tool to reduce serious illness, community transmission, and strain on hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want the people who live and work in our states to know that there is a strong public health, healthcare &amp;amp; scientific community that will continue to stand together to provide and use the data and evidence needed for you to make healthy choices, and we are here to protect our communities.” &lt;strong&gt;– Dr. Erica Pan, Director of the California Department of Public Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines remain a critical tool to prevent severe illness and death. In a void of federal leadership, our four states are stepping forward to provide clear, consistent recommendations our communities can trust. Our commitment is to ensure that our shared guidance is rooted in science and that vaccines people want and need are accessible to all. Public health depends on clarity, equity, and transparency—and that is what we’re delivering today.&lt;strong&gt;” – Dr. Sejal Hathi, MD, MBA, Director, Oregon Health Authority&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines protect more than just ourselves — they help safeguard our families, neighbors, and communities. By staying up to date, Washingtonians can reduce the spread of illness and keep our state strong this season. The Alliance’s recommendations are rooted in science, giving our communities confidence in the guidance we provide.” –&lt;strong&gt; Washington State Secretary of Health Dennis Worsham&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The effectiveness of public health institutions depends on the public’s trust. We understand our responsibility to earn that trust by helping people protect themselves, their families and their community. These recommendations represent a collaborative effort, done with humility and based on science, to meet our responsibilities to our communities and the public at large.”&lt;strong&gt; – Kenneth S. Fink, MD, MGA, MPH, Director, Hawai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ʻ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;i Department of Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Truth under assault&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has aggressively weaponized the CDC by purging its vaccine advisory committee, firing all 17 members and replacing them with cherry-picked appointees who include vaccine skeptics. He’s forced out the CDC director, triggered high-level and career-staff resignations, and scheduled expedited meetings where this reshaped panel will vote on critical recommendations that guide national vaccine policy and insurance coverage. Public health leaders warn these moves dismantle independent, science-based oversight and inject politics into decisions that protect Americans’ health — undermining the CDC’s credibility at a moment when trust and clarity are most needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;States stepping in &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alliance states are fighting back against the Trump administration’s assault on science — sharing a commitment to ensuring that health recommendations are guided by safety, efficacy, transparency, access, and trust. To develop these recommendations, Health Officers, who are all medical doctors, and subject matter experts from each of the WCHA states reviewed guidelines from credible national medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). Our alliance believes that all clinically recommended vaccinations should be accessible to the people of our states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WCHA will continue to build its structure, evaluate new evidence and recommendations as they become available, and determine how to ensure the review process is transparent. WCHA is committed to sharing any updated assessments with our communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Doctors who perform skin cancer surgeries often recommend nicotinamide — which is a form of Vitamin B3 — to their patients. It's been shown to protect cells from UV radiation damage.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, a new study of nearly 34,000 veterans, finds this over-the-counter supplement is linked to a reduction in non-melanoma skin cancers among people who've already had skin cancer. The research was&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2838591" target="_blank"&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Dermatology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The biggest reduction was seen among people who began taking the supplement after being diagnosed with their first skin cancer. Researchers found those who took 500 mg of nicotinamide, also known as niacinamide, twice daily, for at least one month, had a 54% reduced risk of developing another skin cancer, compared to patients who did not take the supplement.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Overall, the reduction in skin cancer risk, across all the participants, was about 14 percent. The reduction was seen in non-melanoma skin cancers, including basal cell carcinoma, which is the most common, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The biggest reduction was in squamous cell cancers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was very surprised at the degree of risk reduction," says &lt;a href="https://dermatology.vumc.org/lee-e-wheless" target="_blank"&gt;study author Dr. Lee Wheless&lt;/a&gt;, of Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a staff physician at the Tennessee Valley Healthcare System VA Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Evidence to support the potential benefits of B3 supplements to protect against skin cancer goes back a decade. The results of a randomized clinical trial in Australia published in 2015 that included 386 people with a history of non-melanoma skin cancers pointed to a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1506197" target="_blank"&gt;reduced risk of new skin cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The 2015 findings led many doctors to recommend B3 supplements to their patients. A survey of 1,500 doctors who perform Mohs surgery — a precise procedure to remove skin cancers — found &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33625146/" target="_blank"&gt;77% recommend &lt;/a&gt;nicotinamide. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sarah Arron is a dermatologist in the San Francisco Bay area, who performs surgery on people with skin cancers. She was not involved in the study. Arron had been on the fence about when to recommend Vitamin B3 to her patients. Now, she says the new study provides stronger evidence and adds more clarity.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The growing body of literature suggests that we should routinely recommend nicotinamide as secondary prevention for all patients with skin cancer and that earlier initiation will have a stronger effect," Arron wrote in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2838594" target="_blank"&gt;an editorial &lt;/a&gt;on the study, which was published alongside the study in JAMA Dermatology.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Arron says the supplement is widely available over the counter and has "minimal adverse effects." She says people should buy the form of the supplement that ends in "amide", rather than niacin (nicotinic acid) which is another form of B3 that does not have the same effects.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I am going to be more rigorous in recommending it to patients, especially patients who are having their first skin cancer. I think the benefit is strongest if we start it early," Arron told NPR. She says the supplement was less effective at preventing skin cancer among participants in the study who began taking B3 after they had already been diagnosed with multiple skin cancers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She points out that more than $8 billion is spent each year to treat skin cancers in the U.S., and she says people tend to underestimate the impact of non-melanoma cancers. Squamous cell skin cancers are very treatable, and are often removed when detected early, but they can spread to other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One unanswered question is whether B3 supplements are beneficial for people who have never been diagnosed with skin cancer.  Arron says more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It is certainly possible that somebody who is at higher risk for skin cancer, who's already showing signs of precancerous change in the skin, might benefit from nicotinamide," she says. "But we'll have to do those studies to see."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says Vitamin B3 has been shown to help protect cells from UV radiation damage.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lots of skin care products, from cleansers to serums to moisturizers include B3, which is marketed as an ingredient to help improve skin tone and texture. There may be aesthetic benefits for the skin, but Arron says it's unclear if these topical products would have any influence on cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;This new study did not evaluate the effects of Vitamin B3 on melanoma risk, which is a type of skin cancer that has a higher risk of spreading, and can be life-threatenting when it's not identified and treated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Arron says when it comes to prevention, the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/06/04/1179542293/picking-the-right-sunscreen-isnt-as-important-as-avoiding-these-6-mistakes" target="_blank"&gt;best strategy to protect skin&lt;/a&gt; is advice you've most likely heard: lather up with sunscreen and cover up.&lt;/p&gt;

They found that those that have had 2 or more tattoo sessions decreased in risk of both invasive and &lt;i&gt;in situ &lt;/i&gt;melanoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In situ &lt;/i&gt;melanoma means that the cancer cells remain on the skin's surface and are more easily removed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, researchers found that the participants with only one tattoo session were more likely to have melanoma, especially &lt;i&gt;in situ. &lt;/i&gt;Experts ponder the reasons why that may be the case, but it is speculative, and more research is needed to understand the pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Tattoos are increasingly common, and it’s an understudied form of environmental exposure, especially in young people. We really need to understand how tattoos could impact risk for different types of cancer,” says Doherty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pew Research Center data shows that a third of American adults have tattoos. Around 41% of Americans under 30 have at least 1 tattoo, as do 46% of people between the ages of 30 and 49. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For melanoma, the results seem to be mixed," Doherty explained. "But we see people with two, three, and four tattoo sessions having decreasing risk, and that’s a stronger pattern than the increased risk with just one session.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the team, they originally hypothesized that having more tattoos would increase melanoma risk due to carcinogens, like metals and other chemicals, in tattoo ink. Experts say that the ink in a person's skin can break down over time and create new carcinogens that weren't originally present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results that tattoos could decrease melanoma risk surprised us. But this isn’t a black and white case of ‘get more tattoos, and you could lower your risk of melanoma,’” explained Rachel McCarty, a post-doctoral scientist at the International Agency for Research on Cancer. "Instead, we need to do more research to understand what we are seeing and if this decreased risk is simply due to behavioral or physical factors, or if there could be beneficial immune responses associated with tattooing which lower melanoma risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One theory that researchers laid out was that those with several tattoos are more cautious with sun safety and take better care of their skin. Another is that tattoos could form a physical barrier that blocks ultraviolet radiation or cause an immune response against precancerous cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tattoo artists already advise their clients to wear sunscreen and sun protection to prevent tattoos from fading,” says McCarty. “We know wearing sunscreen is an important safety step for everyone, even without tattoos."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. &lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr., testifies before a Senate Finance Committee hearing on President Donald Trump's 2026 health care agenda, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., September 4, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Jonathan Ernst | Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Healthy Returns newsletter, which brings the latest health-care news straight to your inbox. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/healthy-returns-newsletter/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to receive future editions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-cdc-announce-new-acip-members-sept-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt; added five new members&lt;/a&gt; to a key government vaccine panel that he purged in June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes before &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a critical meeting of the committee&lt;/a&gt;, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, scheduled for Thursday and Friday. The panel will review data and make recommendations on vaccines for Covid-19 and Hepatitis B, as well as the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella shot, ahead of the fall and winter season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, who are the new advisors? They include an infectious disease expert who has pushed back on Covid mandates, such as vaccine requirements,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;mandates and another member who has advocated for unproven treatments for that virus, including ivermectin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's some evidence to certainly suggest that some of the members have based their opinions on questionable&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;scientific information or have misinterpreted the results of scientific studies," Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's no surprise: The seven members Kennedy appointed to ACIP earlier this year included some widely known vaccine critics. Kennedy maintains that gutting the last committee was necessary to restore public trust in immunizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the panel has traditionally consisted of independent medical and public health experts "who rely on the gold standard of best scientific evidence," Maniar said. He called it "concerning that we're moving in a very different direction with a committee that plays a very important role in terms of immunization policy and coverage" in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP routinely reviews vaccine data and makes recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that determine who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other efforts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what to know about the five new members: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirk Milhoan &lt;/strong&gt;is a pediatric cardiologist at Driscoll Children's Hospital in Texas. HHS in a release said he "holds a Ph.D. in the mechanisms of myocardial inflammation." He is a senior fellow at the Independent Medical Alliance, a group formed in 2020 that has been fighting to&lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ima-secures-major-victory-hhs-removes-mrna-vaccines-from-childhood-and-pregnant-womens-immunization-schedules-302466175.html" target="_blank"&gt; restrict the use of mRNA Covid vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for pregnant women and children and has advocated for unproven Covid treatments. Milhoan's &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/experts/kirk-milhoan/" target="_blank"&gt;bio on the group's website&lt;/a&gt; says he is dedicated to treating patients with "vaccine-related cardiovascular toxicity due to the spike protein." At a 2024 panel on vaccine injuries &lt;a href="https://crescentcitytimes.com/special-event-covid-hearings/" target="_blank"&gt;convened&lt;/a&gt; by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican and vocal Covid shot skeptic, Milhoan claimed those vaccines pose more harm than good. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hillary Blackburn &lt;/strong&gt;is a pharmacist and director of medication access and affordability at the Catholic health system, Ascension. She is the daughter-in-law of Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Griffin &lt;/strong&gt;is an obstetrician and gynecologist based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. HHS said "she was among the first robotic-assisted gynecologic surgeons in the U.S. and has led efforts to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality." According to &lt;a href="https://www.lafourchegazette.com/townnews/medicine/louisiana-legislature-aims-to-remove-covid-19-vaccine-from-school-immunization-schedule/article_f33ddc42-bbfb-11ec-92b0-97e801671a29.html" target="_blank"&gt;local reports&lt;/a&gt;, she has &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/centralcitynews.us/videos/3843797775903484/" target="_blank"&gt;spoken against &lt;/a&gt;Louisiana's decision to add Covid shots to the school immunization schedule and has testified about adverse reactions from vaccines. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raymond Pollak &lt;/strong&gt;is a transplant surgeon in Illinois. In 1999, Pollak was a &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/archive/usao/iln/chicago/2003/pr111703_01.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;whistleblower in a suit&lt;/a&gt; against the University of Illinois Hospital alleging that the hospital admitted patients for liver transplants when they were not medically necessary. HHS said he's published more than 120 peer-reviewed articles and been a principal investigator on National Institutes of Health transplant biology grants and numerous drug trials. Pollak's views on vaccines are unclear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catherine Stein,&lt;/strong&gt; an infectious disease epidemiologist at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. HHS said she has published 115 peer-reviewed articles, and her research has focused on tuberculosis and infectious diseases. Stein has been openly critical of the U.S.'s response to Covid and has downplayed the severity of the pandemic. She told Ohio lawmakers that health officials were inflating Covid death and hospitalization numbers, according to &lt;a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2021/02/22/shes-a-public-health-professor-by-day-a-covid-19-truther-by-night/" target="_blank"&gt;Ohio Capital Journal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We'll be covering the ACIP meeting this week with the new members, so stay tuned for our coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at a new email: &lt;a href="http://annika.constantino@versantmedia.com" target="_blank"&gt;annika.constantino@versantmedia.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Latest in health-care tech: Bye for now!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Ashley, coming to you with some bittersweet news this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Monday, I officially started a new role at CNBC as our AI reporter! I'll be covering the major AI labs, including OpenAI and Anthropic, for our site. There's certainly no shortage of stories to dig into, and I'm excited to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since my coverage scope is changing quite a bit, sadly that means this is my last week as a regular contributor to the Healthy Returns newsletter. It's been so fun to connect with readers through this format, and I'll miss writing it each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there's tons of overlap between AI and health care right now, so I'll still be covering the sector through that lens. You'll still see my byline in the newsletter from time to time, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not going far, so please stay in touch. You can send me tips and story ideas at &lt;a href="mailto:ashley.capoot@versantmedia.com" target="_blank"&gt;ashley.capoot@versantmedia.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until next time! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Latest in health-care: Health care inflation and the GLP-1 stress test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groceries and gas prices get the headlines when it comes to CPI, the closely watched government inflation report. But for much of this year, health care inflation has taken a bigger bite out of our wallets, and it is poised to take an even bigger share of our money next year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With medical care inflation hitting a three-year high in August, insurers are boosting premiums across commercial plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While CPI showed prescription drug costs were up just under 1% in August, high-priced drugs for cancer care remain the top category for health spending for large employers. When it comes to high-volume drugs, GLP-1s are a big cost driver, with the ever-growing list of conditions treatable by Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and the growing demand from workers for weight loss treatments Zepbound and Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-cost, high volume drugs have created big challenges for employers before, from the advent of statins to treat high cholesterol in the 1990s to the breakthrough Hepatitis C treatment Sovaldi a decade ago. In those instances, employers pushed for shifts in pharmacy benefits management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be another moment where PBMs will feel pressure to offer a new model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some employers are beginning to explore how they can get better pricing on GLP-1s through the cash market. While they and the drugmakers would be violating their PBM contracts if they went direct on GLP-1 sales, some new PBM entrants are proposing new contract models for the weight loss treatments and potentially pricey cell and gene therapies in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paytient CEO Brian Whorley calls it a stress test moment for the PBM market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mr. Hemsley goes to Washington&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108146030" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;UnitedHealth Group Inc. signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on April 21, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has become commonplace to see chief executives from big tech and pharmaceutical companies meeting with White House officials and President Trump himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-13"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/UNH/"&gt;UnitedHealth Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; CEO Stephen Hemsley seems to be taking a page from that playbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemsley met with the president's chief of staff Susie Wiles recently, according to the Wall Street Journal. The move comes as the UnitedHealth CEO is trying to get out company out from under a cloud of regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer, legal staff approached the Department of Justice about an investigation into its business, and later this fall the company is set to release an outside audit of its business practices in its Medicare and pharmacy benefits units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the report, a spokesman for the company told CNBC, "Public policy shapes health care across America, and it's our responsibility to engage with the administration and Congress at all levels to improve patient access and affordability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Bertha at a new email: &lt;a href="http://annika.constantino@versantmedia.com" target="_blank"&gt;bertha.coombs@versantmedia.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 17:02:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOT0NGZkU3bkdzSXZqc2R5dDRhRmU2b2JMWEJGRnhlMUZsVjJ0UkpCbXpPblpWcWdIQTRsWDdMOWt6YjUtLUk3TXFOX2pUTGJNbEJCemZ5aC1DVUhZam9MZGdyQnl3alJwQVFjT09CWm4zMzF6U2pNX25GLXpXTjhoNFk2WW1xMVp3LWdCeHhEbkx3eDhrc2s1elN0aUJxR0NGX09LNEhKRdIBrAFBVV95cUxNZTJMRVhRdVJibUNmT2ZqSm5hU2E0cjQtRWp4RTlHcG1hS1FjS011RHpzUXh3SGt1ek1kMEFrQU5qWkx6SzVka2l4VFFpUjQ1YzhhWHdHRW9BbjFVNGUtbmRPVnNxeFBUVC1UbVNYM0hMRkZ6MTQ2YW5UVzNaRUZQT1JIQUV2VjVSX0JmZVRRR3NVTGJITzhHTzZOc0VxYkdQYW51eWtCZTBoMjZv</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员警告说， “食肉”弧菌杀死了第五名路易斯安那州居民- NOLA.com</title><link>https://www.nola.com/news/healthcare_hospitals/louisiana-flesh-eating-bacteria-vibrio-cases-2025/article_139bbeb3-7cec-4db0-bc32-f1ba7f4d8448.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="1"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fifth person in Louisiana has died of a vibrio vulnificus infection, a dangerous flesh-eating bacterium that has caused 26 hospitalizations in the state so far, a sharp increase compared to the annual average of about 10 cases and one death over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is found in warm, brackish coastal waters and raw or undercooked seafood, especially oysters. Most infections in Louisiana this yearÂ â€” 22 of 26Â â€” have been tied to water exposure. But at least two deaths, including a sixth death from a Florida resident who ate oysters harvested from Louisiana waters, have been linked to raw or undercooked seafood.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Of the Louisiana patients, more than 90% had an underlying health condition such as diabetes, liver disease or another immune-compromising illness. The Louisiana Department of Health declined to say whether the most recent death was tied to oyster consumption or water exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Surging across the Gulf&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gulf Coast is seeing rising cases outside of Louisiana as well. Texas has reported 10 cases and one death, Mississippi five cases and one death, and Alabama has seen three cases, one tied to Louisiana oysters, according to those state health departments. Florida has recorded numbers similar to Louisiana, with 25 cases and five deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

Vibrio vulnificus is a bacterium in the same family as those that cause cholera. It normally lives in warm seawater and is part of a group of vibrios that are called "halophilic" because they require salt.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say infections peak between May and October, when Gulf waters are warmest and residents are most likely to swim, fish or handle seafood. Rising summer temperatures, stronger heat waves and runoff from increasingly intense storms extend the season when Vibrio can flourish, said Tiong Aw, public health microbiologist with Tulane University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€œAlongside this increasing water temperature, we have more frequent and intense storms, and this can also wash extra nutrients into the water,â€� Aw said. â€œAll these create an ideal condition for Vibrio to grow and survive.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;h3&gt;A dangerous infection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least a dozen species of Vibrio bacteria can cause illness, but Vibrio vulnificus is the most severe. Once inside the body, the bacteria can trigger necrotizing skin infections, bloodstream infections, or gastrointestinal illness. About one in five people with severe infection die, sometimes within 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-default tnt-inline-width-default"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-white"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-f000c0a4-64ee-58f1-9388-eeb1445bdc45" data-instance="#gallery-items-139bbeb3-7cec-4db0-bc32-f1ba7f4d8448-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-139bbeb3-7cec-4db0-bc32-f1ba7f4d8448"&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€œItâ€™s very dramatic,â€� said Julio Figueroa, an infectious disease expert at LSU Health New Orleans who has treated cases. â€œVulnificus is, aptly, a good name for it.â€�&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hallmark symptom is the sudden appearance of fluid-filled blisters near a wound site. The infection can also worsen quickly. For some people, it might take a week and a half for the infection to start to cause symptoms concerning enough to seek medical help. For others, death can occur within 48 hours of exposure, said Figueroa.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The infection can be treated with antibiotics, which are most effective if used early on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is most at risk?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While healthy people may recover from Vibrio infections with antibiotics and supportive care, those with chronic conditions are vulnerable. People with liver disease, diabetes, cancer, HIV or weakened immune systems are at greatest risk for hospitalization, limb amputation or death.

&lt;p&gt;LDH urges residents to take simple steps to prevent infection, such as staying out of brackish or salt water if you have a wound and covering it with a waterproof bandage. Wash any cuts exposed to seawater or raw seafood with soap and clean water, and seek medical care immediately if a wound shows signs of redness, swelling or blistering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;College of Pharmacy Professor Jaime Ross has discovered that cognitive decline occurs in a sex-dependent manner, mirroring patterns observed in humans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="170" data-end="656"&gt;Tiny fragments of plastic, known as microplastics and nanoplastics, are now so widespread in the environment that they regularly make their way into our bodies through the food we eat, the water we drink, and even the air we breathe. A new study from the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/university-of-rhode-island/"&gt;University of Rhode Island’s College of Pharmacy&lt;/a&gt; reports that these particles can travel throughout the body, reaching organs such as the brain, where they may build up and contribute to conditions resembling &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_44d955d660610a76fe199b3479668107" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/span&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="658" data-end="1216"&gt;This research builds on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/08/230828162343.htm"&gt;earlier work&lt;/a&gt; showing that microplastics are capable of passing through the blood-brain barrier, a natural defense system that usually shields the brain from harmful agents as tiny as viruses and bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="658" data-end="1216"&gt;Assistant Professor Jaime Ross extended the investigation to explore how these plastics affect brain function. Her team’s results suggest that the accumulation of micro- and nanoplastics in the brain may play a role in memory loss and cognitive decline, particularly in people with certain genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Testing Microplastic Exposure in Mice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ross’ latest study, published recently in the journal &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research Communications&lt;/em&gt;, examined mice that had been genetically modified to include the naturally occurring gene APOE4, a strong indicator of Alzheimer’s risk, making people 3.5 times more likely to develop the disease than those who carry the APOE3 variant of the gene that is passed from parents to offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_494767" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-494767" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Jaime-Ross.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-494767" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Jaime-Ross-777x518.jpg" alt="Jaime Ross" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Jaime-Ross-777x518.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Jaime-Ross-400x267.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Jaime-Ross-768x512.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Jaime-Ross-150x100.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Jaime-Ross-450x300.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Jaime-Ross.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-494767" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;URI College of Pharmacy Assistant Professor Jaime Ross has found links between micro- and nanoplastics and Alzheimer’s Disease in mice. Credit: URI Communications&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In these mice, like in people, it’s not a guarantee that you’re going to see any changes in cognition. You could have identical twins both carrying APOE4, one totally cognitively healthy, and the other could develop Alzheimer’s disease,” Ross said. “So that tells us there’s something about lifestyle, something about the environment going on. There are modifiable factors we’re studying related to Alzheimer’s–diet, exercise, vitamins, and especially environmental toxins like microplastics. If you carry the APOE4, and you happen to consume a lot of microplastics, will this contribute to Alzheimer’s disease?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, Ross and her team exposed two groups of mice—one with the APOE4 variant and one with APOE3—to micro- and nanoplastics in their drinking water over a period of three weeks. The tiny particles from polystyrene—among the most abundant plastics in the world, found in Styrofoam take-out containers, plastic cups, and more—infiltrated the mice’ organs, including the brain, as expected. The research included a control group from each APOE designation did not receive microplastic exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ross’ team then ran the mice through a series of tests to examine their cognitive ability, beginning with an open-field test, in which researchers put a mouse in a chamber and allow it to explore at will for 90 minutes. Ordinarily, a mouse will hug the walls, naturally attempting to hide from potential predators. However, after microplastic exposure, the APOE4 mice—especially the male mice—tended to wander more in the middle of the chamber and spend time in open space, leaving themselves vulnerable to predators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Behavioral and Memory Changes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test their ability to recognize novel objects, Ross placed mice in an open chamber with two distinct objects. After having time to explore the objects, the mice were removed and returned later, this time with one of the objects replaced with a different shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The female mice with APOE4 and microplastic exposure were slow to recognize the novel objects, if they did at all, a sign of cognitive decline affecting memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the first test, you can see the males are spending more time and resting more in the center of the arena. In females, we saw changes in novel object recognition,” Ross said. “In human Alzheimer’s patients, men tend to experience more changes in apathy; they care less. Women experience more changes in memory. So the memory and the apathy connection are pretty clear: When you expose animals that are carrying the largest known risk factor in humans for developing Alzheimer’s disease to micro- and nanopastics, lo and behold, their behavior changes in a sex-dependent manner similar to the sex-dependent differences we see with Alzheimer’s patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Growing Environmental and Health Crisis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are concerning enough to warrant further study into the cognitive decline caused by exposure to micro- and nanoplastics, which are among the most prominent environmental toxins to which people are routinely exposed. (A separate &lt;a href="https://www.uri.edu/news/2023/08/new-uri-study-finds-extensive-microplastics-in-narragansett-bay/"&gt;URI study released in 2023 revealed of the extent to which microplastics&lt;/a&gt; accumulate in the environment, shockingly finding that the top two inches of the floor of Narragansett Bay contain more than 1,000 tons of microplastics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ross is continuing to expand her research into the topic and encourages others to do so, in the hope of leading to better regulation of the toxins. The Microplastics Safety Act, introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in July, would direct the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to study the human health impacts of microplastics in food and water, specifically focusing on vulnerabilities for children, the endocrine and reproductive systems, and links to cancer and chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There has not been a lot of money spent on the human health impacts of microplastics,” Ross said, noting she is in regular discussion with the Rhode Island Congressional delegation about the need for regulation. “It’s interesting that what we’re seeing in mice is similar to what we’re seeing in the real world. We want to encourage further research into the scourge of micro- and nanoplastics.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts say taking niacinamide, a derivative of vitamin B3, could help slash the risk of developing skin cancer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamadermatol.2025.3237?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamadermatol.2025.3238"&gt;JAMA Dermatology&lt;/a&gt;, researchers concluded: 'In this study nicotinamide use was associated with reduced skin cancer risk in those with at least one prior skin cancer.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They noted the risk reduction was greatest when patients started taking vitamin B3, also known as niacinamide, after their first instance of skin cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its protective effect gradually decreased with each subsequent skin cancer—with those diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) experiencing the biggest benefit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SCC is the second most common form of skin cancer, with more than 25,000 people diagnosed with the condition every year in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it is highly survivable in its early stages, when left untreated it can spread to other areas of the body where it becomes more difficult to treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kimberly Breglio, a dermatologist specialising in immunology and study co-author, said: 'Timing of treatment was a crucial variable in our study, with patients experiencing benefit only when initiated after the first few skin cancers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Our results aligned with the risk estimates previously reported that showed a 30 to 50 per cent reduction in risk of skin cancer.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Earlier this year, comedian Katherine Ryan, 41, revealed she's battling cancer for the second time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts, while confident in the link between vitamin B3 and skin cancer prevention and treatment, acknowledged their study did have some limitations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They noted that the cohort used is not necessarily generalisable, with the majority of participants being male. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they added: 'This is a population that is at greater risk for skin cancer than the general population, so any risk reduction among this group would likely be similar to those with lesser baseline risk.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also noted that their study design was a retrospective observational study, rather than a randomised clinical trial which would allow them to better account for any potentially confounding variables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As such they said further research is needed to determine the optimal potential for vitamin B3 with regards to skin cancer prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a review of the study, Dr Sarah Arron, high risk skin cancer programme lead at the University of California, welcomed the findings, saying: 'The growing body of literature suggests that we should routinely recommend nicotinamide as secondary prevention for all patients with skin cancer ad that earlier initiation will have a stronger effect.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Predominantly caused by exposure to ultraviolet rays via the sun or sunbeds, experts have long warned that up to 87 per cent of skin cancer cases could be avoided. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet a shocking 70 per cent of people in the UK make catastrophic errors when it comes to sun protection, increasing the risk of the deadly disease. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as Cancer Research UK predicted there could be as many as 26,500 new cases of melanoma—the deadliest form of skin cancer—diagnosed every year by 2040, with the incidence rate raising faster than any other common cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When diagnosing melanoma skin cancer, which typically presents as moles that have uneven edges, dermatologists look out for asymmetry, border, colour, diameter and evolving moles, known as the ABCDEs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;How the cancer is treated depends on whether the cancer has spread, with only a third of patients diagnosed at stage four surviving beyond five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Non-melanoma cancers, including SCC and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), starts in the top layer of skin and are usually caused by overexposure to UV rays from the sun and sunbeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The main symptoms include a growth or unusual patch on the skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finding non-melanoma skin cancer early can mean it's easier to treat so anyone who is worried about a new growth that has changed in colour or texture, hurts, bleeds, crusts or scabs for more than four weeks is urged to contact their GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In March, comedian Katherine Ryan, 41, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/tvshowbiz/article-14523725/Katherine-Ryan-cancer.html"&gt;revealed she's battling skin cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She made the revelation in her podcast, Telling Everybody Everything, explaining that she paid to have mole removed from her arm and learned shortly afterwards that it was cancerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-fc1495d0-93d5-11f0-b9af-3da9fba99df6" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15107545/vitamin-B3-niacinamide-skin-cancer.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;What is malignant melanoma? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Malignant melanoma is a serious form of skin cancer that begins in melanocytes, cells found in the upper layer of skin that produce melanin, which gives skin its colour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While less common that other types of skin cancer, it is more dangerous because of its ability to spread to other organs more rapidly if it is not treated at an early stage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-medium"&gt;Symptoms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new mole or a change in an existing mole may be signs of melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melanomas can appear anywhere on your body, but they're more common in areas that are often exposed to the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some rarer types can affect the eyes, soles of the feet, palms of the hands or genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Check your skin for any unusual changes. Use a mirror or ask a partner or friend to check any areas you cannot see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In particular, look for: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Moles with an uneven shape or edges &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Moles with a mix of colours &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Large moles - melanomas often tend to be more than 6mm wide &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Moles that change size, shape or colour over time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-medium"&gt;Causes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultraviolet (UV) light is the most common cause of melanoma.

The treatment you have will depend on where it is, if it has spread and your general health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgery is the main treatment for melanoma. Radiotherapy, medicines and chemotherapy are also sometimes used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgery could involve removing the melanoma and an area of healthy skin around it, swollen lymph nodes if the cancer has spread to them and other parts of the body if it has spread to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If a large part of skin has to be removed, a skin graft might be needed which could see kin taken from another part of the body to cover the area where the melanoma was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiotherapy is sometimes used to reduce the size of large melanomas and help control and relieve symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Targeted medicines and immunotherapy are used to treat melanomas that can't be dealt with by surgery, or have spread to lymph glands or other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chemotherapy, which kills cancer cells, is sometimes used to treat advanced melanoma when it has spread to another part of the body. It does not work as well as other treatments, but can be used if you are unable to have them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-medium"&gt;How dangerous is it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Generally for people with melanoma in England:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;almost all people (almost 100%) will survive their melanoma for 1 year or more after they are diagnosed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;around 90 out of every 100 people (around 90%) will survive their melanoma for 5 years or more after diagnosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;more than 85 out of every 100 people (more than 85%) will survive their melanoma for 10 years or more after they are diagnosed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Sources: NHS, the Skin Cancer Foundation and Cancer Research UK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is one of the most comprehensive demonstrations to date of how generative AI can model human disease progression at scale, and was trained on data from two entirely separate healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Details of the breakthrough were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09529-3" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the journal Nature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Medical events often follow predictable patterns,” said Tomas Fitzgerald, a staff scientist at EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). “Our AI model learns those patterns and can forecast future health outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tool works by assessing the probability of whether – and when – someone may develop diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease and many other disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Named Delphi-2M, it looks for “medical events” in a patient’s history, such as when illnesses were diagnosed, together with lifestyle factors such as whether they are or were obese, smoked or drank alcohol, plus their age and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tool also looks at anonymised patient record data to predict what might happen over the next decade and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tool was trained and tested on anonymised patient data from 400,000 people in the UK Biobank study and 1.9 million patients in the Danish national patient registry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Health risks are expressed as rates over time, similar to forecasting a 70% chance of rain at the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ewan Birney, the EMBL interim executive director, said patients might be able to benefit from the tool within the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You walk into the doctor’s surgery and the clinician is very used to using these tools, and they are able to say: ‘Here’s four major risks that are in your future and here’s two things you could do to really change that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I suspect everyone will be told to lose weight, and if you smoke you will be told to stop smoking – and that will be in your data so that advice isn’t going to change remarkably – but for some diseases I think there will be some very specific things. That’s the future we want to create.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said the advantage of the new AI tool over existing ones – such as the Qrisk method of calculating risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next decade – was “we can do all diseases at once and over a long time period. That is the thing that single disease models can’t do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team said: “Delphi-2M predicts the rates of more than 1,000 diseases, conditional on each individual’s past disease history, with accuracy comparable to that of existing single-disease models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Delphi-2M’s generative nature also enables sampling of synthetic future health trajectories, providing meaningful estimates of potential disease burden for up to 20 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Moritz Gerstung, the head of the division of AI in oncology at the German &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research Centre, said: “This is the beginning of a new way to understand human health and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Generative models such as ours could one day help personalise care and anticipate healthcare needs at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxNYkc3SlFfRF9GRWotblI0c0tRbFNxNkJEN1FsOXAzbGM5cVNIYzlxMU1OLW1RNzZ6RHRBc2NCZXlxNVlnLWZyMmZxYmtsejZ4d1FZSjFUM0hjY2p2QjQzM2hyUndfVzJsR3hmbmpZNy1pWVpKbGVwU0Q0cXR5cGhONjR6SFVRTWhiNzMtSl9nQlpUQ1I0MXhpRHNYb0ZVSEdLc2QwaFB4YzVPdEFnOWJxNDZHdlRKWTRXVGMyU1pSNjFkZjA</guid></item><item><title>Highmark研究：对于那些希望减肥的人来说，手术胜过Ozempic等药物- TribLIVE.com</title><link>https://triblive.com/local/regional/highmark-study-surgery-beats-drugs-like-ozempic-for-those-looking-to-lose-weight/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;One of neurologist Anelyssa D’Abreu’s least favorite tasks is giving her patients a dreaded diagnosis: early-stage Alzheimer’s disease. But it’s not quite as bad as it used to be. Today when they ask, “Is there anything we can do?” D’Abreu has a new answer: “Perhaps.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike a decade ago, when D’Abreu had little to offer her patients with Alzheimer’s, there are now drugs that may impede the disease’s progression. The difficulty with this approach, however, is that it comes with a trade-off. The new medications carry the risk of serious side effects, including brain bleeds, strokelike symptoms and even death. Yet they also come with hope, something new for Alzheimer’s patients and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/collections/cbeideifhd" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02927-7/d41586-025-02927-7_51451710.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Innovations In Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugs in this class, known as anti-amyloid therapies, have not gained much traction. In limited studies, they have been shown to slow or even decrease one of the biological symptoms of Alzheimer’s: the accumulation of amyloid beta in the brain. Nearly four dozen studies on these drugs have been conducted since 2018, and collectively they indicate that anti-amyloid therapies may marginally reduce the rate of cognitive decline. Some experts say that could offer perhaps an additional year of independence. But the clinical trials completed to date rely on only 18 months’ worth of published data, and their success has been tempered by the drugs’ significant downsides. Additionally, the framing of these drugs’ success has come under criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D’Abreu, who heads the University of Virginia neurology department’s cognitive and behavioral neurology division, was initially apprehensive about offering antiamyloid treatments to her patients with early-stage Alzheimer’s. A relatively high percentage of participants in the anti-amyloid studies experienced brain swelling and microbleeds, events known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), which can lead to disability or even death. Up to 40 percent showed brain swelling, and up to 28 percent had brain bleeds. D’Abreu wasn’t the only physician who hesitated over such potentially severe side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, researchers and clinicians were highly skeptical of these drugs when they were introduced. They had shown promise in clinical studies but are only now yielding enough data in real-world scenarios for scientists to gain a better understanding of their efficacy. After much thought, D’Abreu decided it was important to offer her patients the option. When people are functionally independent, she says, delaying progression toward full-blown Alzheimer’s is a big deal. “If it really slows down a person in the mild-cognitive-impairment stage, that makes a huge difference,” she says. Among the 50 or so people at her hospital who have received the therapy so far, none have experienced any serious adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s affects about 7.2 million people over age 65 in the U.S., according to the Alzheimer’s Association, and about 74 percent of them are 75 or older. Scientists have been seeking treatments for decades; because amyloid beta plaques can begin accumulating long before noticeable symptoms appear, most efforts aimed to clear them from the brain and prevent the formation of new ones. In 2021, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration fast-tracked the first anti-amyloid therapy, some hoped it would be what patients and providers had been waiting for: a drug that could stop Alzheimer’s in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aducanumab, marketed by manufacturer Biogen as Aduhelm, got the green light from the FDA under the agency’s accelerated-approval pathway. It was the first medication to target, reduce and remove amyloid beta plaques. There was little evidence, however, that amyloid beta clearance correlated with slowed cognitive or functional decline. And the drug introduced the risk of ARIA, in addition to being riddled with other problems: controversial clinical-trial results, skepticism from the FDA’s own advisory committee, an initial average annual price of $56,000, and refusal by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to cover the cost without additional clinical evidence of efficacy. Just 31 months after its approval, Biogen announced it was removing aducanumab from the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, the FDA has approved two more anti-amyloid treatments: lecanemab (Leqembi), made by Eisai in partnership with Biogen, and donanemab (Kisunla) from Eli Lilly. Both slowed cognitive decline better than aducanumab or placebo in clinical studies. But both also come with a risk of ARIA. In the phase 3 clinical trial for lecanemab, which assessed efficacy and safety in large groups of people, about 9 percent of participants taking a placebo had brain swelling or hemorrhages, compared with 17.3 percent of those in the lecanemab group. In four separate donanemab trials, up to 30.5 percent of the participants showed brain abnormalities, compared with 0.8 to 7.2 percent in the placebo groups, and three deaths related to ARIA were attributed to the drug. Both therapies are also expensive—an average annual price of $26,500 for lecanemab or $32,000 for donanemab, plus hundreds to thousands more for required brain scans and other monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These therapies are not an option for everyone with Alzheimer’s. They are recommended only for patients at early disease stages, and people most at risk for ARIA should avoid them. To identify the best candidates, D’Abreu and other neurologists put their patients through extensive cognitive assessments, costly positron-emission tomography scans to look for amyloid in the brain that would help them diagnose the condition, and tests to determine whether they carry the gene variant &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; ε4, which increases dementia risk and the likelihood of brain swelling or bleeding in people taking anti-amyloid medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the improved ability to assess risk, some neurologists remain highly dubious of available anti-amyloid therapies, as well as of the hypothesis they’re based on: that amyloid is the root cause of the disease. James Burke, a neurologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, was skeptical when lecanemab was approved in 2023 and says there still isn’t enough clinical evidence to change his mind. Researchers have been collecting data beyond the 18-month time frame but currently have no good understanding of the drugs’ longer-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke thinks it’s important to draw a line between statistically significant changes, such as cognitive decline slowing by a reported 27 percent with a drug compared with a placebo, and those that are clinically meaningful, such as whether patients can drive safely or care for themselves with minimal assistance. “It’s not obvious that people are even going to know the benefit is there,” he says, but “the harms are very substantial and almost certainly badly underestimated.” He notes that those harms, which include strokes and deaths that some attribute to the drugs, have occurred in rigorously controlled settings that do not necessarily reflect real-world conditions. Trial participants often are healthier and younger, on average, than typical dementia patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke is resigned, however, to the inevitability of prescribing anti-amyloid therapy for patients who meet the criteria. “If that’s what they want, there’s no point, for a provider who has access to treatment, in putting up a wall. They’ll just get the treatment someplace else.” But he also focuses on other approaches, such as helping people reduce vascular risk factors, eat a healthier diet and exercise more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now these drugs are the best pharmaceutical interventions on offer, says Judith Heidebrink, a neurologist and cognitive-disorder specialist at the University of Michigan Medical School. She was involved in the lecanemab phase 2 trial and its open-label extension. “Even given these risks,” she says, those taking the drug are, on average, “more likely to maintain a higher level of independence and have slower disease progression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was what 80-year-old Bob Merriman was hoping for. He had seen both his parents and a brother ravaged by Alzheimer’s. He knew his odds of developing it were high, and he desperately wanted to avoid the same fate. His wife, Mary, says he had signs of confusion and was getting easily frustrated with simple tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merriman reached out to his physician after hearing about anti-amyloid therapies and was referred to Heidebrink for evaluation. After extensive cognitive testing, magnetic resonance imaging and blood work to determine whether he had cognitive impairment or a genetic predisposition to Alzheimer’s (he did), Merriman began receiving biweekly infusions of lecanemab last November. He was willing to accept the potential risks and is checked regularly for signs of ARIA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was determined,” Mary says. “He was like, ‘No, I know what the alternative is.’ ” She adds that he seems more focused than before and plans to continue taking the treatment for as long as possible. As anti-amyloid drugs edge into the mainstream, they are enabling additional research that can better predict who might be most susceptible to brain swelling and microbleeds, along with improved ways to find and manage potential risks. The result is increased confidence in these therapies among neurologists who might prescribe them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many patients who take lecanemab seem to share this confidence and, like Merriman, feel the drug helps them on some level. (Lecanemab has been on the market longer than donanemab.) D’Abreu and other neurologists say most of their patients choose to complete the initial 18-month course and often continue with maintenance therapy. That’s helped sway D’Abreu’s thinking on the medication, but she is not yet convinced of its efficacy. Because it’s possible for patients with mild cognitive impairment to remain stable for months without treatment, she says she can’t be certain how large a role anti-amyloid therapy plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke remains highly skeptical that the benefits of these therapies outweigh the risks. “This medicine can cause bleeding in the brain in one in 200 people,” he says. “It’s not a safe or benign medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fewer neurologists are sitting on Burke’s side of the fence these days, however. More than two years after lecanemab was approved, overall hesitancy among practitioners in the field has shifted. In February 2024 market research firm Spherix surveyed 75 neurologists and found that fewer than half of them recommended lecanemab to their patients. They cited low satisfaction with the data and frustration with issues such as insurance coverage, logistics surrounding infusion access, and burdensome follow-up testing. A year later, however, 80 percent of those surveyed said they were now discussing anti-amyloid therapies with their patients. The average number of patients on lecanemab per surveyed neurologist has increased about fivefold. There are not enough data yet to gauge the acceptance of donanemab, which received full FDA approval in July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the use of anti-amyloid medication becomes more widespread, there’s also a need to better understand what happens when people on these therapies come into the emergency room experiencing a stroke or a blood clot, conditions that would usually be treated with drugs to induce thrombolysis, breaking up the clot. “Right now our data are incredibly limited, but there’s a bunch of case reports of truly catastrophic bleeding when people are on amyloid-lowering agents and then get thrombolysis,” Burke says. These concerns have become common enough that a report was recently published in &lt;i&gt;JAMA&lt;/i&gt;, the most widely circulated medical journal, to help clinicians weed through the details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis that amyloid beta is a root cause of cognitive decline is popular, and it’s where the major drug companies have placed much of their focus. But it’s not the only one, and controversy has plagued it for decades. It’s been the subject of allegedly manipulated studies, and some assert academic institutions and government agencies have funneled research dollars to support this approach. The first positive results from aducanumab were preceded by a long line of failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even ardent proponents of the antiamyloid theory agree that additional methods for treating Alzheimer’s are necessary. One idea is to use combination therapy, similar to how HIV or cancer drugs are administered, according to geriatrician Howard Fillit, co-founder and chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation. He says trials are underway for other therapies that target tau proteins in the brain, as well as inflammation and various metabolic pathways, all of which &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02926-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02926-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;contribute to disease progression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There also are ongoing trials to determine whether anti-amyloid drugs administered before symptoms emerge can delay or even prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s. The AHEAD 3-45 study, which comprises two trials, is testing whether the approach is effective against preclinical Alzheimer’s—when amyloid plaque builds slowly and silently in the brain. If the amyloid hypothesis is correct and these clumps of protein are the primary cause of Alzheimer’s, presymptomatic therapy could remove or prevent the formation of these plaques early on, thereby halting disease altogether. If the trials are successful, researchers may find that “we’ve actually delayed the inevitable clinical course for some of these patients,” says Lon Schneider, a neurologist and gerontologist at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine. The study should be completed in 2031.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D’Abreu’s center at the University of Virginia is participating in a longer-term trial of donanemab, comparing the daily function of patients who are taking the drug versus those who are not. She still has concerns about the risks of anti-amyloid therapy, but as more data become available, she is increasingly comfortable about its safety and efficacy. More research could provide a more nuanced understanding of whether these drugs make a difference for patients and their care partners or whether the marginal improvement is not worth the untenable—and potentially lethal—burdens. D’Abreu remains cautiously optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America’s Health Insurance Plans’ &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/ahip-statement-on-vaccine-coverage" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; comes just ahead of the first meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ 12 members handpicked by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The selection of the five newest members was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/15/kennedy-names-new-acip-members-cdc-vaccine-advisers/"&gt;announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;, and their meeting is Thursday and Friday. Experts have speculated that, among other steps, the panel will drop the existing recommendation that newborns receive the hepatitis B vaccine, a move that could lead to a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/11/newborn-hep-b-vaccine-debate-how-it-started/"&gt;resurgence of the virus&lt;/a&gt; and, as a result, liver disease and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Health plan coverage decisions for immunizations are grounded in each plan’s ongoing, rigorous review of scientific and clinical evidence, and continual evaluation of multiple sources of data,” AHIP said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AHIP said its plans will cover all vaccines recommended by ACIP as of Sept. 1, 2025, and that there would be no cost sharing for patients through the end of 2026. That includes updated Covid-19 and influenza vaccines. Health insurers are required to make vaccines free if they are recommended by ACIP and adopted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but AHIP’s pledge ensures coverage will continue even if the new members change the panel’s recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pledge is significant because of the sheer size of AHIP’s &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/members" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;member plans&lt;/a&gt;, which together provide coverage and services to over 200 million Americans. They include over a dozen Blues plans, Centene, Aetna, Elevance, Humana, Kaiser Permanente, Molina, and Cigna. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealthcare, the country’s largest health insurer, is not an AHIP member. The company did not immediately respond when asked about its vaccine coverage plans. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amy Killelea, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, said AHIP’s announcement is important because it preserves access in the face of volatility. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s very much a calming of the anxiety and fear out there, to say, ‘We are not going to do anything on a whim, we are not going to make massive changes at this time. We are going to hold steady to the evidence base that’s been in place, that’s been reviewed by ACIP not very long ago,’” Killelea said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy shocked the public health world in June by &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/09/rfk-jr-fires-every-member-of-cdc-vaccine-expert-panel-acip/"&gt;firing&lt;/a&gt; all 17 members of ACIP, a panel of experts that advises the CDC, and then &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/11/rfk-jr-names-new-acip-members-replaces-cdc-vaccine-experts-he-just-fired/"&gt;quickly naming&lt;/a&gt; eight new members, one of whom has since dropped out. Those members, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/15/kennedy-names-new-acip-members-cdc-vaccine-advisers/"&gt;five new ones&lt;/a&gt; announced Monday, include well-known vaccine critics and people with little or no vaccine expertise. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s ACIP first met in June, but the group &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/cdc-acip-rfk-vaccines-public-health-policy-changes/"&gt;did not make major changes&lt;/a&gt; to vaccine recommendations for children or adults.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the meeting in Atlanta this week, in addition to considering the hepatitis B vaccine, the group will make recommendations related to Covid-19 shots and the pediatric vaccine schedule. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Many people &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/04/covid-vaccine-access-limited-by-prescription-requirements-insurance-coverage/"&gt;have struggled&lt;/a&gt; to get Covid-19 vaccinations since Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;announced in May&lt;/a&gt; that they were no longer recommended for healthy children over 6 months old and healthy pregnant people. The panel’s existing recommendations include Covid-19 vaccinations for all adults and children over 6 months old, but with “shared clinical decision-making,” meaning they’re eligible with a doctor’s approval. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Any changes ACIP makes would need to be approved by the CDC’s acting director, Jim O’Neill. Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/cdc-director-fired-behind-the-scenes-look/"&gt;ousted&lt;/a&gt; the agency’s previous director, Susan Monarez, after she refused his demand that she later approve all of ACIP’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p class="nih-pretitle"&gt;Wednesday, September 17, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;h1&gt;NIH launches landmark project on whole-person health and function&lt;/h1&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has launched an effort to advance research on whole-person health and create an integrated knowledge network of healthy physiological function. Whole person health involves looking at the whole person—not just separate organs or body systems—and considering multiple factors that promote health. For example, a multicomponent lifestyle intervention including healthy diet, physical activity and stress management may improve multiple and interconnected aspects of health including cardiovascular (e.g. blood pressure), metabolic (e.g. glucose metabolism) and musculoskeletal function (e.g. muscle strength).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Biomedical research is largely organized around the study of specific organs and diseases. In contrast, we do much less research on health itself, which is an integrated process involving the whole person,” said Helene M. Langevin, M.D., director of NIH’s National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, which leads the NIH-wide program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The five-year research initiative will proceed in several stages, drawing from existing scientific knowledge to develop a complete, working model of healthy human physiology. It will build on the NIH &lt;a href="https://humanatlas.io/"&gt;Human Reference Atlas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/HuBMAP"&gt;Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)&lt;/a&gt; to connect the complex anatomy and function of the body’s different organs and systems into a single “map.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future stages of the project will link common clinical measures, such as blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol, to major physiological functions. This initiative will also populate the framework with existing human data and ultimately build and test an interactive model of whole-person health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By organizing healthy physiological function into a whole-body knowledge network, researchers will be able to explore scientific questions about health in a new way,” said Dr. Langevin. “With our ability to acquire new scientific data at an increasingly dizzying speed, the importance of integrating and connecting new data to what we already know is greater than ever. The Whole Person Reference Physiome will lay a foundation for understanding the factors that drive declines in health and mechanistic pathways to health restoration.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information about the research program is available on the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT) website, here: &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/NHCW3mdunUCF3ULUAvilYQ/project-details/11224772#description"&gt;https://reporter.nih.gov/search/NHCW3mdunUCF3ULUAvilYQ/project-details/11224772#description&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

News releases, fact sheets and other NCCIH-related materials are available on the &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/"&gt;NCCIH website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the National Institutes of Health (NIH):&lt;/strong&gt; NIH, the nation's medical research agency, includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Other types of fatty fish, like mackerel and sardines, deliver the same benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eggs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you like them scrambled, hard-boiled, or over easy, experts say they’re great for your skin. “&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a62282874/eggs-every-day-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Eggs;cpos:17;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Eggs&lt;/a&gt; are a great source of vitamins A and E, which support cell growth and promote healthy skin hydration,” says Dr. Gratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pumpkin seeds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin seeds are a tasty source of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g65992526/symptoms-of-zinc-deficiency/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:zinc;cpos:18;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt;, which is vital for skin health, says &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fletsliveitup.com%2Fpages%2Flena-bakovic&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa66127718%2Ffoods-for-skin-health%2F" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lena Bakovic, M.S., R.D.N., C.N.S.C.;cpos:19;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Lena Bakovic, M.S., R.D.N., C.N.S.C.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Live It Up. “Zinc plays an important role in wound healing, inflammation, and immune function,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Chickpeas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chickpeas are rich in protein, vitamin E, zinc, and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65893243/types-of-magnesium-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:magnesium;cpos:20;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, and help reduce inflammation and support collagen production,” Dr. Gratch explains. Their mild flavor also means you can enjoy them in chilis, salads, grain bowls, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Flaxseeds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a plant-based source of omega-3 fatty acids, Bakovic recommends flaxseeds. &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://ijprajournal.com/issue_dcp/The%20Science%20of%20Flaxseed%20in%20Skincare%20%20A%20Review%20on%20Its%20Moisturizing%20and%20Hydrating%20Benefits.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;cpos:21;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that they help keep skin moist and combat the processes that promote premature aging and collagen breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Berries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you opt to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a64542223/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-blueberries-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eat blueberries every day;cpos:22;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;eat blueberries every day&lt;/a&gt; or are looking for reasons to add more strawberries, raspberries, or blackberries to your plate, experts say these help boost skin health. “Antioxidants found abundantly in plant-based foods like berries work to protect cells from oxidative stress damage,” says Bakovic. “This plays a role in healthy skin maintenance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Quinoa&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like berries, Bakovic says that quinoa is a whole grain that is rich in antioxidants—particularly quercetin, which research in &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2025.1523905/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Frontiers in Pharmacology;cpos:23;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Pharmacology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found promotes skin barrier repair and reduces pigmentation and scarring for people with acne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Turmeric&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakovic recommends seasoning your food with the spice. Research in the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/7/3617" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:International Journal of Molecular Sciences;cpos:24;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Journal of Molecular Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has shown that curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, may help prevent premature skin aging, treat inflammation from psoriasis and acne, protect against sun damage, and reduce wound healing times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Olive oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Use this in cooking and dressings,” suggests Pelitera. “Olive oil is a good source of mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids, providing support for healthy [cells and] tissues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Walnuts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nuts are great snack options that contain vitamin E, selenium, and healthy fats to nourish and protect the skin,” Dr. Gratch says. Walnuts are a great pick because they contain the highest concentration of omega-3 fatty acids of any nut, per &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/good-food/4-health-benefits-of-walnuts-and-how-much-you-should-eat/2024/02" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UC Davis Health;cpos:25;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UC Davis Health&lt;/a&gt; (they’re also a palatable source, if fish isn’t your thing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bell peppers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This colorful, crunchy veggie “provides a good source of vitamin C and vitamin A while also being high in water content for a source of hydration,” Pelitera says. Enjoying every color will ensure you’re getting a wide variety of antioxidants and beneficial plant compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Almonds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Almonds are a powerful source of vitamin E, which is a fat-soluble vitamin and essential for skin health,” says Pelitera. Almond butter will deliver the same perks—just choose one made with just the nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dark chocolate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dark chocolate is a good source of polyphenols, which can help inhibit enzymes that degrade collagen and elastin, which are important for encouraging supported skin structure and function,” Pelitera explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Water (and water-rich foods)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s not technically a food, but hydration is so important to healthy skin that H2O has to be on this list. “Drinking sufficient daily amounts of water as well as consuming foods with high water content (such as cucumbers and watermelon) helps to maintain skin moisture levels, working towards reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles,” Bakovic explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 13:43:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNUEFKMjN6Y091aXJhLWRIdURuU1lBczg1VEwzcWVWMjhHLVF1a0ZjazBJalJjbEdrazVnRlduOGNVVmVYZkdtdmVxQ0QxY2FNZm81YUNQZlc3a3U5RTFNcXVDRUE0RWtVU2xyMU1rLVl1UFI4QkU3NHV2REI1eHN5SHd3</guid></item><item><title>金毛猎犬非常喜欢猫，它在搞笑视频中让主人很担心- DogTime</title><link>https://dogtime.com/news/190657-golden-retriever-dog-love-cat-pillow-video</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people think of a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever,&lt;/a&gt; they often picture a loyal, affectionate, and occasionally overly clingy dog. Pair that personality with a cat — an animal famous for valuing personal space — and you might expect some tension. But in one household, the dog’s boundless affection has turned the family cat into an unlikely “pillow.” A TikTok video of the duo captures the moment, showing their owner both amused and slightly concerned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tiktok-video-shows-golden-retriever-using-cat-as-a-pillow"&gt;TikTok video shows Golden Retriever using cat as a pillow&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A viral TikTok video features a Golden Retriever and her cat sibling in an unusually cozy scene. In the clip, the big Golden pup can be seen lying comfortably with her head resting right on top of the smaller cat’s head. At first glance, it almost looks as though the cat might be trapped under the weight of her fluffy companion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The owner, who is filming, can be heard laughing nervously as she checks to make sure the cat is okay. She gently lifts the dog’s head, worried the pressure might be too much for the smaller pet. To her surprise, the cat is not only perfectly fine but also purring loudly and sound asleep. What’s more, the feline seems completely unfazed by being used as a pillow. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the video’s caption, the owner explains that they were initially worried about introducing the two pets, unsure if they would get along. Nonetheless, those doubts didn’t last long. “She loves her little brother and she’s so gentle with him,” the owner wrote, adding that their &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/174748-instagram-viral-video-rescue-dog-cat"&gt;bond has only grown&lt;/a&gt; stronger over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The playful mix of concern and cuteness struck a chord with TikTok users. Many of them shared similar stories about their pets forming unlikely friendships in the comments section. “I was worried my rescue and GP/lab wouldn’t get along. Needless to say, they’re best friends,” one user said. Another teased that it was “the literal representation of loved him to death.” Someone even reassured the worried owner, writing, “I promise if the cat did not want it he would not allow it lol.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-study-shows-why-high-fat-diets-make-the-brain-forget-faster-and-how-it-might-be-reversible"&gt;Study Shows Why High-Fat Diets Make the Brain Forget Faster — And How It Might Be Reversible&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-quaternary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In just seven days, fruit flies on a high-fat diet struggled to remember things they had learned only hours earlier.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The problem wasn’t brain shrinkage but a jammed-up “cleanup crew” inside neurons that normally recycles damaged cell parts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Intermediate- and long-term memory were affected, while short-term memory, like instant recall, stayed intact.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When researchers boosted the cleanup process, memory function returned, suggesting the damage may be reversible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHIBA, Japan —&lt;/strong&gt; Ever had trouble remembering where you put your phone, or what someone told you earlier in the day? Most of us chalk it up to being distracted or tired. But new research suggests something else might be at play: what you eat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study from Chiba University in Japan, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1011818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, shows that a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/high-fat-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high-fat diet&lt;/a&gt; can disrupt memory in fruit flies in as little as a week. The damage didn’t strike all kinds of memory equally. The flies could still recall things right away, but memories meant to last a few hours or even a full day slipped away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The culprit wasn’t &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/weight-gain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/sitting-too-much-brain-shrinkage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain shrinkage&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the problem traced back to a jammed-up cellular “cleaning crew” that normally keeps neurons in working order. And surprisingly, once that cleanup system was boosted, memory bounced back—even while the flies stayed on their fatty diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-brain-s-cleaning-crew-gets-overloaded"&gt;The Brain’s Cleaning Crew Gets Overloaded&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the experiment, fruit flies were given either a normal diet or one laced with 20% coconut oil. That’s roughly like a person getting a fifth of their calories from added fats. Flies might sound like an odd choice, but their brain cells share many of the same maintenance systems as ours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After seven days, the flies on the high-fat diet showed trouble with something called &lt;em&gt;autophagy.&lt;/em&gt; You can think of autophagy as the brain’s cleaning service: it sweeps away broken proteins and worn-out cell parts before they pile up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But under the fatty diet, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/high-fat-diets-genes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;this system faltered&lt;/a&gt;. Cellular garbage began to build up inside neurons, especially in regions tied to memory. It wasn’t that the flies lacked the tools. They still had plenty of lysosomes—the little sacs inside cells that break down waste. The problem was that autophagosomes (the bags that collect trash) and lysosomes (the bins that break it down) failed to connect. With the two unable to merge, the cleanup stalled, leaving junk scattered through the neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happened-to-the-flies-memory"&gt;What Happened to the Flies’ Memory&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientists then tested how this cellular gridlock affected behavior. Flies were trained to avoid certain smells linked with a mild electric zap. Normally, a fruit fly can remember this for a few hours or even a day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results were clear: flies on the fatty diet forgot within hours. Their short-term memory (what they remembered right after training) was fine. But when tested three hours later, their recall was poor. By the next day, their long-term memory &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/memory-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;had also weakened.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In daily life, the type of memory most affected is the one that helps us recall what was said earlier in a meeting, where we placed an object, or what someone asked us to pick up from the store. It’s the glue that holds everyday routines together.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-the-damage-be-undone"&gt;Can the Damage Be Undone?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is hope to be had, however. When the researchers tinkered with the flies’ brain cells to ramp up their cleanup systems, the memory problems eased. They tried three different approaches:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turning off a protein called Rubicon&lt;/strong&gt;, which normally slows autophagy.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overactivating another protein, Atg1&lt;/strong&gt;, which jump-starts cleanup.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeding flies rapamycin&lt;/strong&gt;, a drug that helps cells recycle waste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All three strategies worked. Flies regained their ability to form memories that lasted for hours, even though they stayed on the high-fat diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was a catch: when autophagy was pushed too far in flies on a normal diet, their memory dipped. This shows the brain needs balance. Too little cleanup leads to clutter, but too much may throw healthy processes off track.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean for everyday people? It’s not a direct prescription, but it offers some big-picture clues. First, it shows that diet-related &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/disrupted-sleep-memory-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory problems&lt;/a&gt; may not be permanent. The brain’s cleanup system can bounce back if supported. For humans, that support could come from more balanced eating patterns, lifestyle changes that encourage healthy metabolism (like exercise and good sleep), or — one day — medicines that safely boost this recycling process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-octonary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="" alt="Image depicts brain food by showing a fork with healthy food on it and a human brain on the handle." class="wp-image-126478" data-lazy-src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brain-food.jpg"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brain-food.jpg" alt="Image depicts brain food by showing a fork with healthy food on it and a human brain on the handle." class="wp-image-126478"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;What you’re picking up at the end of your fork plays a big role in how your brain operates. (Image by Lightspring on Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also highlights the importance of balance. The study found that artificially boosting the cleanup system in healthy flies on normal diets slightly reduced memory performance, suggesting the brain needs precisely balanced maintenance activity. That means there’s no magic pill. The body works best when its systems are in sync, and extreme fixes can backfire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, the practical lesson is that what we eat can affect the brain’s housekeeping surprisingly quickly. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Choosing foods&lt;/a&gt; that don’t overload the system may help preserve focus and memory in the short run, while also protecting long-term brain health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyond-fruit-flies"&gt;Beyond Fruit Flies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fruit flies, of course, are not people. But they offer a quick way to see how diets affect memory at the cellular level, something that’s much harder to study directly in humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that memory may be far more sensitive to diet &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/snacking-on-junk-food-could-seriously-corrode-your-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;than we realize&lt;/a&gt;. While many studies have looked at long-term eating patterns and dementia risk, this experiment shows measurable changes within just a week. That’s startlingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also offers a possible explanation for why high-fat diets are linked in human studies to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and other forms of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cognitive-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;. If our brain’s cleaning crew can’t keep up, damaged proteins may accumulate and interfere with memory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, there are limits. The study used only male flies, and only one type of fat (coconut oil). Different fats might act differently, and sex differences may matter too. Human diets also span decades, not days. So while the findings are provocative, they’re not a direct prescription for people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-bigger-picture"&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cellular cleanup system doesn’t just protect memory. It’s vital for health throughout the body, from the liver to the heart. That means the effects of a high-fat diet could ripple &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/high-fat-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;well beyond the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, the message is less about panic and more about awareness. Our brains depend on well-tuned maintenance crews. If diet can throw those off balance in days, it may help explain why some people feel mentally sluggish after periods of heavy eating—and why diet is increasingly linked to long-term brain health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The encouraging news? The brain’s systems &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aren’t rigid&lt;/a&gt;. They can bounce back if given the right support. While scientists are still far from translating these fly experiments into human therapies, the idea that diet-linked memory loss might be reversible is a hopeful one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology&lt;/strong&gt;: Male fruit flies were fed either a normal diet or one with 20% coconut oil for seven days. Memory was tested at three time points: 3 minutes (short-term), 3 hours (intermediate-term), and 24 hours (long-term). Brain tissue was examined for cleanup markers, and genetic and drug interventions were used to tweak autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;: Flies on the fatty diet showed impaired intermediate- and long-term memory, though short-term memory stayed intact. Their neurons accumulated waste due to failed fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes. Enhancing autophagy genetically or with rapamycin restored memory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;: Only male flies and one fat source were tested. Short exposures in flies don’t directly translate to decades-long human diets. Effects on other memory systems remain to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;MSPCA-Angell is advising owners to vaccinate their dogs after golden retriever puppies with a potentially deadly disease were found abandoned in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five young puppies were found near Geneva Avenue in Dorchester on Aug. 23, and three of the puppies tested positive for the Parvovirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parvo is highly contagious and potentially deadly, so when the puppies tested positive, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://boston.gov/departments/animal-care-and-control__;!!BspMT6SJLSDJ!IGosr4mt9Ygx5aPpCvWvnlZ1NjxaQ8CZffVW6e6OKlSM8hXExLBxpuKTZJWBzUCHkBnnmrZco19Pew%24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Boston Animal Control&lt;/a&gt; immediately reached out to us for help,” said Mike Keiley, vice president of the MSPCA-Angell’s Animal Protection Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parvovirus can be transmitted from dog to dog or from indirect exposure to things contaminated by feces. The virus can kill an infected puppy within 48 hours of showing symptoms, according to MSCPA-Angell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Big-Red-is-in-a-foster-home-while-he-completes-his-recovery-credit-MSPCA-Angell-68caa7b338389-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-34002305" srcset="https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Big-Red-is-in-a-foster-home-while-he-completes-his-recovery-credit-MSPCA-Angell-68caa7b338389-scaled.jpg?width=200 200w, https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Big-Red-is-in-a-foster-home-while-he-completes-his-recovery-credit-MSPCA-Angell-68caa7b338389-scaled.jpg?width=300 300w, https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Big-Red-is-in-a-foster-home-while-he-completes-his-recovery-credit-MSPCA-Angell-68caa7b338389-scaled.jpg?width=400 400w, https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Big-Red-is-in-a-foster-home-while-he-completes-his-recovery-credit-MSPCA-Angell-68caa7b338389-scaled.jpg?width=500 500w, https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Big-Red-is-in-a-foster-home-while-he-completes-his-recovery-credit-MSPCA-Angell-68caa7b338389-scaled.jpg?width=600 600w, https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Big-Red-is-in-a-foster-home-while-he-completes-his-recovery-credit-MSPCA-Angell-68caa7b338389-scaled.jpg?width=700 700w, https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Big-Red-is-in-a-foster-home-while-he-completes-his-recovery-credit-MSPCA-Angell-68caa7b338389-scaled.jpg?width=800 800w, https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Big-Red-is-in-a-foster-home-while-he-completes-his-recovery-credit-MSPCA-Angell-68caa7b338389-scaled.jpg?width=900 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Big Red in foster care.&lt;i&gt; – MSPCA-Angell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Golden Retrievers are a highly sought-after breed, so it’s abnormal that a bunch were found sick and alone outside like this,” Keiley continued. “No one has stepped forward to claim the dogs, so considering all of the circumstances, we believe they were abandoned.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the three puppies with the Parvovirus were hospitalized for six days before entering foster care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third puppy with the virus, named Big Red, will be available for adoption within the next nine days after he clears the virus and gastrointestinal parasites from his system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that there will be a lot of interest in adopting Big Red. Although we can only pick one adopter, we’re so excited that he’ll soon have the very best home and a bright future after a challenging start,” Keiley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation into the puppies’ abandonment remains ongoing between Boston Animal Control and MSPCA-Angell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fb-post" data-width="500" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/bostonanimal/posts/pfbid02SaokxJvzu8U8LUyqAExUnzS8B6eVMF9jNxiDbgbq5ANyynQ5T7dZGCrHdDN9zJ1zl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you thought the secret to prolonging the life of your gorgeous bouquets required some kind of mad floral scientist’s toolkit—special powders, mystery chemicals, or that cryptic sachet that comes with supermarket flowers—think again. For Claire Delon, a florist in the heart of Lyon, the game-changing solution was already sitting in her fridge. That’s right: sparkling water.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5177416233695826" data-ad-slot="3757471395" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-3814"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How a Soda Mishap Sparked a Floral Revolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claire Delon isn’t your average florist. Sure, she started out the traditional way, as an apprentice in a classic flower shop, learning all the basics of floristry. But curiosity got the better of her—and thank goodness for that. Instead of sticking strictly to tried-and-true methods, Claire began experimenting with every technique and trick to make her arrangements outlast the others. Her efforts paid off, but not in the way you might expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, an accident changed everything. As she tells it: “A bottle of soda was spilled near some bouquets, and I noticed those flowers lasted longer. That piqued my curiosity and kicked off a whole series of experiments.” Who knew a little spill could lead to a revelation, right? It was this quirky observation that led Claire to try using sparkling water—and the results were, well, effervescent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Winning Method: Simple, Fizzy, Effective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several attempts with different approaches, Claire found that nothing worked as well as sparkling water. She explains, “I noticed that the flowers retained their brightness and freshness twice as long when I replaced part of the vase water with sparkling water. The carbon dioxide really seems to work wonders.” That’s right—not a high-tech fix, not an expensive additive, but a gentle fizz that works miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process couldn’t be simpler. Here’s Claire’s method for sparkling success:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-4"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5177416233695826" data-ad-slot="2855453267" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix one part sparkling water with three parts tap water in your vase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure the water is at room temperature—this helps avoid giving your flowers a chilly shock! (No one likes cold feet, not even tulips.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And voilà, a simple switch to your flower care routine, and your floral displays could look fresh and vivid twice as long. The secret ingredient? Good old carbon dioxide, which, it turns out, does more than just create festive bubbles in your drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blooms That Last—and Why That Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claire’s sparkling water technique isn’t just a neat trick for fellow florists. Her discovery brought surprising benefits to her shop as well. Not only did the quality of her bouquets improve, but a new clientele flocked to her boutique, drawn by the promise of longer-lasting flowers. As word spread, her shop’s foot traffic and reputation flourished—much like her blooms!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages of using sparkling water don’t stop there. By noticeably extending the lifespan of bouquets, this method offers several important perks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less floral waste:&lt;/strong&gt; Bouquets stay vibrant for longer, so fewer get tossed out prematurely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More value for customers:&lt;/strong&gt; Clients can enjoy their flowers longer, reducing the need for frequent purchases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better for the environment:&lt;/strong&gt; Fewer purchases and less waste help shrink the carbon footprint of beautiful blooms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a win-win: finer flowers for longer, and a little less guilt about that extravagant bouquet you just couldn’t resist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-4"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5177416233695826" data-ad-slot="2855453267" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An Idea with Room to Grow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, Claire Delon’s innovative approach gives consumers an economic boost and moves the floral industry toward greater sustainability. By putting the spotlight on methods that are as straightforward as they are effective, she’s nudging others in the sector to rethink their practices for a greener, more flourishing future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, next time your bouquet starts drooping, skip the mystery powders, and remember Claire’s simple advice: a splash of sparkling water might just keep your flowers smiling twice as long. Your blooms (and your conscience) will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it comes to cancer, early detection is not just a dull public health slogan – it can literally save millions of lives. The secret sauce? Getting to know your own body and keeping those detective senses sharp for any little anomaly that pops up. Forget the stereotype that only lumps or drastic physical changes matter. In fact, being your own health detective opens the door to catching sneaky early symptoms and, with a bit of luck, tackling problems before they snowball.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5177416233695826" data-ad-slot="3757471395" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-3820"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking Your Senses Seriously: It’s Not Just What You See&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several scientists want to set the record straight. It’s not just about visible or tangible changes. The sense of smell – yes, your humble nose – could be a surprising ally in early detection. For women in particular, attention should be paid to vaginal discharge, because any alteration in odor or consistency could potentially be an early warning sign of cervical cancer. But don’t fret needlessly! We’re not talking about minor fluctuations that happen from month to month. The real red flag is any unexpected or persistent change that sticks around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unexpected persistent lump or bump&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes in vaginal discharge (odor or consistency)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other bodily anomalies you can notice yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Early Detection Matters: Advice From Dr. Nikki Kanani&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General practitioner Dr. Nikki Kanani hammers home a crucial point: “By detecting risk signs at an early stage, any abnormal cell can be treated quickly before it has a chance to potentially develop into cancer.” Seems simple, right? But here’s the twist: in the early phases of many cancers – including cervical – there aren’t really obvious symptoms. That’s right, no grand announcement, no dramatic pain, not even the dreaded spontaneous bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does that mean? It’s the perfect recipe for procrastination. After all, if nothing feels wrong, why go for a test? The answer is plain: because science says so. In the case of cervical cancer, the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; way to catch trouble before it begins is a regular &lt;strong&gt;smear test&lt;/strong&gt; (also known as a pap smear). This preventive test uses a swab to detect abnormal cells on the cervix before they have a chance to become cancerous. This may not sound like a blast, but the consequences of skipping it are far less fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those inclined to put off their test, Dr. Kanani offers gentle but firm encouragement:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“We know it can seem embarrassing and you can easily postpone it, but accept your invitation because having a check-up could save your life.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-4"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5177416233695826" data-ad-slot="2855453267" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Numbers and The Enemy Behind the Curtain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, around 3,000 women develop cervical cancer, and 1,000 die from it. And who’s the villain in most cases? Persistent infection with a high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) – a very common virus, often transmitted via sexual contact. The cold truth is that cervical cancer rarely shouts its presence in the early stages. That’s what makes regular screening so powerful: it spots abnormalities before things get out of hand, often before any symptoms would raise a single eyebrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About 3,000 women develop cervical cancer annually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roughly 1,000 deaths per year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most cases linked to long-term infection with high-risk HPV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about statistics, though. It’s about creating a habit of self-awareness, noticing not only what you see but what you &lt;em&gt;smell&lt;/em&gt;. The takeaway couldn’t be clearer: if something seems strange and it sticks around – whether it’s a lump, a lingering odor, or any other bodily weirdness – consulting a health professional promptly could make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion: Listen to Your Body (And Don’t Ignore That Check-Up Reminder!)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s recap: Saving lives from cancer may be as much about your own senses as about science. Knowing what’s normal for your body allows you to spot early, subtle changes – whether they be visible, tactile, or olfactory. For women, changes in vaginal discharge, especially in odor or texture, are not to be ignored. But don’t wait for dramatic symptoms; when it comes to cervical cancer, they likely won’t show up at the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most powerful tools in the fight against cervical cancer? Observation, regular screening, and a dash of courage to accept that invitation to have a smear test. So, take a sniff, don’t be shy, and remember: embarrassment lasts minutes, but early detection can mean the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-4"&gt;

She and her husband only made it 20 minutes into the drive north to a hospital in La Grande before she felt her water break. Ten minutes after that, her husband still barreling down the highway, she had a daughter in her arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;But Banister‚Äôs newborn did not make any sounds ‚Äî she had fluid in her lungs.

Tina Kotek‚Äôs office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;With roughly half of all Oregon births covered by Medicaid, hospital administrators say it is likely that more hospitals ‚Äî already operating on thin margins ‚Äî may follow Baker City‚Äôs lead. The result: more dangerous pregnancies and higher rates of maternal and infant mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúMost hospitals lose money on maternity services already,‚Äù said Jeremy Davis, CEO of Grande Ronde Hospital in La Grande, the hospital where many Baker City women have turned to for obstetrics care after Saint Alphonsus closed its birthing center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just going to put further pressure on hospitals on whether they can continue to retain some of these essential services,‚Äù Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;A handful of Oregon health care providers are already taking steps to scale back maternity care.

Oregon Medical Group plans in November to &lt;a href="https://www.oregonmedicalgroup.com/obgyn" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;shut down its OB-GYN department&lt;/a&gt;, which serves patients at McKenzie-Willamette Medical Center in Springfield, because of an exodus of providers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The Samaritan Health system was also &lt;a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/05/samaritan-health-considers-closing-maternity-units-in-lebanon-lincoln-city.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;considering eliminating labor and delivery units&lt;/a&gt; at two of its five hospitals ‚Äî North Lincoln and Lebanon Community, both serving rural areas ‚Äî due to resource and cost constraints.

Two years prior, in 2022, it was about -4.1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;These margins are even more precarious for smaller, rural medical centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/E73CTR6SINGVFNBCXWHAOGD3OI.JPG?auth=ecc01bcf0142e5c911044c0b00c610985c89f33964e1c984375a6a2a121e5578&amp;amp;width=150" alt="A view of Baker City, Ore. taken on Sept. 12, 2025 from the outskirts of town, near Teela Banister‚Äôs home.

Both plans pay providers significantly less than commercial insurers, the Hospital Association says: Medicaid in Oregon only reimburses about 56 cents for every dollar spent on a patient‚Äôs care, while Medicare pays back 82 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;A high proportion of patients on Medicaid can be an indicator of a hospital‚Äôs financial vulnerability. In a &lt;a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_on_rural_hospitals.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;June letter&lt;/a&gt; opposing the ‚ÄúBig Beautiful Bill,‚Äù U.S. Senate Democrats used this metric to identify rural hospitals across the country that could be financially devastated by Medicaid cutbacks, putting them ‚Äúat-risk‚Äù of service cuts or closure. Whether a hospital had been operating with negative margins for three or more years was another factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Four Oregon medical centers were identified as ‚Äúat-risk‚Äù in the letter. This includes Providence Seaside, which has operated with negative margins since at least 2020, according to financial disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Some rural medical centers are able to make up a portion of their operating losses through other revenue, such as grants, special federal designations that raise insurance reimbursements, or through a property tax district. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Still, Medicaid remains a financial lifeline for rural hospitals, and administrators say constricting that critical source of revenue may threaten their ability to sustain services like obstetrics at the same level moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúObstetric units do not make money,‚Äù explained Dr. Katy Kozhimannil, a professor of health policy at the University of Minnesota. ‚ÄúWhen the bottom falls out from Medicaid financing as a small rural hospital, you can‚Äôt keep maintaining a unit that is operating at a loss.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Senate Republicans allocated $50 billion in the ‚ÄúBig Beautiful Bill‚Äù to provide ‚Äú&lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/the-one-big-beautiful-bill-protects-rural-hospitals" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/the-one-big-beautiful-bill-protects-rural-hospitals"&gt;immediate relief&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù to rural hospitals. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator Mehmet Oz have argued that rather than &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2025/09/15/healthcare-kennedy-oz-invest-rural-hospitals/85944121007/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2025/09/15/healthcare-kennedy-oz-invest-rural-hospitals/85944121007/"&gt;putting money toward a system&lt;/a&gt; that has failed rural patients, the fund would transform rural health care by focusing on technological and lifestyle tools to tackle the root causes of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚Äú$50 billion has been dedicated to transform rural health care delivery nationwide‚Äîrepresenting a structural shift away from propping up failing models toward sustainable, long-term solutions,‚Äù Oregon Republican Party Chairwoman Connie Whelchel said in a statement to InvestigateWest, adding the fund will ‚Äúfinally prioritize‚Äù rural communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;While it‚Äôs unclear exactly how the money will be divvied up, Oregon Health Authority is expecting to receive around $100 million annually through 2030 ‚Äî about 4% of the anticipated cuts to the state‚Äôs Medicaid plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Band-Aid on an amputation,‚Äù Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) said in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EvVcKpvgQ" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EvVcKpvgQ"&gt;remarks on the Senate floor&lt;/a&gt; in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Recent financial woes against the backdrop of broader instability was one of the primary reasons Samaritan Health had planned to downsize its labor and delivery program, CEO Marty Cahill said. The system was also looking at consolidating its urology, orthopedics and general surgery services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúWe just might not be able to [offer labor and delivery] in all five of our hospitals,‚Äù Cahill said. ‚ÄúWe might have to start to consolidate down to a fewer number of hospitals, so that we can again provide that quality of care that we want to.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Across the state, Wallowa Memorial Hospital CEO Dan Grigg said they are not yet talking about service cuts. But as the head of a small, independently owned medical center serving roughly 8,000 people in rural northeastern Oregon, Grigg understands the difficult decisions some hospitals may make to cut or reduce high-cost services like obstetrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúWhen it comes between closing a hospital and closing a service,‚Äù Grigg said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre always going to close the service before you close the hospital.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray"&gt;Growing maternity care deserts &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Maternity care has increasingly been on the receiving end of cutbacks as hospitals try to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Since 2010, more than 500 hospitals in the U.S. closed their obstetrics units, leaving more than half of all rural hospitals and a third of all urban hospitals without the service, according to a study published in the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2827543" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;medical journal JAMA&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Kozhimannil, who was a lead author on the study, says there are a few reasons why a hospital might decide to shutter a maternity ward, but they all boil down to a question of resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Like emergency rooms, labor and delivery units need to be staffed 24/7 in the event they receive a patient in the middle of childbirth. This means hospitals need to have obstetricians, labor and delivery nurses, anesthesiologists and neonatologists regularly on-call ‚Äî positions that are highly specialized and difficult to hire for, especially in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;This round-the-clock availability also translates to higher overhead costs which hospitals are rarely able to fully recoup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;For one, most simply do not receive enough patients for the department to be profitable. Kozhimannil says the average hospital needs about 200 births annually to keep their unit viable, but a third of facilities in the U.S. operate under that minimum threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúWe do about 50 deliveries a year and so we‚Äôre only getting paid 50 payments for those deliveries,‚Äù said Grigg, the CEO of Wallowa Memorial. ‚ÄúIf you do 1,000 deliveries with the same standby cost, you‚Äôre getting that payment a thousand times over.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Even then, most payments from insurance don‚Äôt cover the full cost of care for childbirth. For instance, the average reimbursement the Oregon Health Plan &lt;a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/HPA/ANALYTICS/Pages/Hospital-Payment-Report.aspx" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;gave to hospitals in 2023&lt;/a&gt; for a complication-free, vaginal delivery was about $8,521. The average cost for this kind of delivery in the U.S. is about $15,712, per the &lt;a href="https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/health-costs-associated-with-pregnancy-childbirth-and-postpartum-care/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative monitoring health care costs and quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúIf the overall organization is still profitable ‚Ä¶ you can absorb those financial losses,‚Äù said Davis, the CEO of Grande Ronde Hospital. ‚ÄúIf the organization has multiple years of financial losses, now all of a sudden, your criteria and the lens has changed to where you‚Äôve got to start looking at an individual department level or service line level.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;When a hospital closes an obstetrics unit, expectant mothers often end up traveling farther to reach the closest hospital, not only for labor and delivery but also for care related to potential complications and postpartum recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Studies have found this added distance lends itself to more births in riskier settings like emergency rooms, at home or in vehicles, as well as higher numbers of pre-term births.

Anticipating an influx of patients from Baker City, the medical center hired on extra obstetrics nurses and trained their emergency room staff and first responders about what to do in the event a laboring woman cannot reach the hospital, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúMinutes matter and they really do make the difference between a mother going home with a baby in her arms and a mother going home with empty arms,‚Äù said Amanda Vinson, a registered nurse at Samaritan Lebanon‚Äôs Girod Birth Center and member of the Oregon Nurses Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The loss of a birth center can additionally lead to decreases in the availability of other kinds of reproductive health care, like postpartum mental health support, doula and midwife services and gynecological surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúWhen a hospital stops providing obstetric services, those risks do not go away,‚Äù Kozhimannil said. ‚ÄúThose risks are still there, they‚Äôre just not borne by the hospital any more.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray"&gt;Accessing care where it isn‚Äôt&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;When Baker City‚Äôs birth center shuttered, Shelley Payton, a local doula, tried to fill in the gap that was left. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Her role had always been to support her clients through birth by facilitating communication with their care team and providing an extra set of hands wherever necessary. But in the aftermath of the closure, she became a coordinator and confidant for women across the region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Baker City is remote.

The average household income in Baker County is about $58,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;One woman who ended up going to the emergency room at Saint Alphonsus told Payton the doctors there missed that she was experiencing preeclampsia ‚Äî a condition involving persistent high blood pressure that can lead to serious issues for both the mother and baby if left untreated. The woman only got that diagnosis a few days later, when she was able to make it to La Grande, according to the doula. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Payton said other clients who went to Saint Alphonsus‚Äô emergency room for possible pregnancy complications were told they could not be treated there and would need to be transported via ambulance or helicopter elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The closure even impacted other areas of care. A mother of three told InvestigateWest she developed severe anemia after she was unable to get a timely procedure to address ‚Äúuncontrollable‚Äù menstrual bleeding because Saint Alphonsus no longer provided the service in Baker City. It took another two months for her to get the procedure after she switched to another hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no longer as easy as just showing up to the hospital in Baker like, ‚ÄòYeah, I want to come in real quick and get checked out,‚Äô‚Äù Payton said. ‚ÄúThat requires a lot more time and planning now and obviously that‚Äôs not something people want to do, especially if they‚Äôve got a sleeping toddler at home.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Weighing these risks, some women, like Dallas Pfeiffer, decided to temporarily relocate before their due date to be closer to a hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Pfeiffer found out she was expecting a second child in the summer of 2023, shortly after the closure of Saint Alphonsus‚Äô obstetrics unit. Having had a C-section during her first delivery, she thought picking a larger hospital in Boise would be a safer bet if something went awry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Pfeiffer‚Äôs new doctor urged her to be in Idaho at least a week before her scheduled C-section, in case she went into labor early.

    &lt;p&gt;Being slightly overweight might not shorten your life, but being very thin might. A large Danish study tracking more than 85,000 adults has found that people with a BMI below 18.5 were nearly three times more likely to die early than those in the middle to upper end of the so-called “healthy” range. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link between &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/bmi-2668"&gt;body weight&lt;/a&gt; and health is more complicated than often assumed. This &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1098063#:%7E:text=The%20study%20of%20tens%20of,of%20the%20normal%20weight%20range."&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt;, which is yet to be peer reviewed, suggests that the lowest risk of death may not sit neatly in the traditional “healthy” body mass index (BMI) range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the findings suggest that people with BMIs that would normally be classed as “overweight” appear to have outcomes that are just as good as, or even better than, those with lower BMIs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers found a U-shaped curve when plotting BMI against mortality, meaning those with the lowest and highest BMIs were at the highest risk of death. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the data, presented as a conference paper at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, being underweight carried the greatest danger. People with a BMI below 18.5 were nearly three times more likely to die prematurely than those with a BMI between 22.5 and 24.9.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those at the lower end of the “healthy” range also faced higher risks, with BMIs between 18.5 and 19.9 doubling the likelihood of death. Even people with BMIs between 20 and 22.4 were at a 27% higher risk of an early death compared with the reference group. These findings seem surprising, given that the BMI range of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/obesity/"&gt;18.5 and 24.9&lt;/a&gt; is usually considered optimal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the scale, carrying extra weight did not always translate into greater risk. In the study, people with BMIs between 25 and 35 (typically categorised as “overweight” or “obese”) showed no significant increase in mortality compared with the reference group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only those with a BMI of 40 or more saw their risk of death rise substantially, more than doubling (2.1 times). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings add further data that challenges the common societal association between thinness and health. But research shows that &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-14-371"&gt;being underweight is a risk to health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-022-02778-1"&gt;particularly in older age&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having some fat reserves can help the body cope with illness. For example, patients undergoing cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, &lt;a href="https://www.macmillan.org.uk/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/coping-with-treatment/changes-in-weight"&gt;tend to lose weight&lt;/a&gt; due to factors such as appetite loss and changes to taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those with more fat reserves at the start can draw on them, helping their bodies continue essential functions. In contrast, someone with very little fat may run out of reserves quickly, limiting their body’s ability to recover. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unintentional weight loss is also often a &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/symptoms/unintentional-weight-loss/"&gt;warning sign of illness&lt;/a&gt;, with conditions such as &lt;a href="https://www.wcrf.org/living-well/living-with-cancer/your-questions-answered/weight-loss/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about-diabetes/type-1-diabetes/symptoms"&gt;type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; often resulting in weight loss before diagnosis. This means a low BMI can sometimes be a marker of underlying disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not surprising&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from the researchers’ conference paper, there have been headlines such as: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250914205759.htm"&gt;Being too thin can be deadlier than being overweight, Danish study reveals&lt;/a&gt;. That might sound surprising, but it shouldn’t. We need food to survive, and without it, we will die. We know this, and have known this for hundreds, if not thousands of years.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without food, the body enters a catabolic state, where it breaks down tissues to get the energy needed to keep the brain functioning. In this process, other important body functions, such as immune function, are put on hold to prioritise energy for the brain.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the Danish participants in this study had all undergone body scans for health reasons. These scans are costly, so they are usually carried out for a good reason – when a health issue is suspected.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledge that a possible reason for their findings is that  participants could be losing weight due to an underlying illness, and so it could be the illness itself, rather than the associated weight loss that is increasing the risk of death.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the findings reinforce what other research has suggested: thinness is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8368050/"&gt;not always protective&lt;/a&gt;, and extra weight is &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/41/3/bnaa004/5780090?login=true"&gt;not always harmful&lt;/a&gt;. The concept that you can be “fat but fit” continues to gain scientific backing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this mean the “healthy” BMI range should be revised upward? The researchers suggest this, saying that modern medical advances, which help people manage obesity-related conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, could be shifting the safest weight range higher than before. A BMI between 22.5 and 30 may now carry the lowest risk of death, at least in the Danish population studied. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A blunt tool&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, BMI has always been a blunt tool, as I have &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-you-cant-judge-health-by-weight-alone-260659"&gt;previously argued&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t take into account important factors for health, such as diet, lifestyle, and fat distribution, among others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BMI can be misleading for people from different racial, ethnic, or cultural backgrounds. Critics say the standard cutoffs are based &lt;a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/how-use-bmi-fetishizes-white-embodiment-and-racializes-fat-phobia/2023-07"&gt;on white body types&lt;/a&gt;, which can make perfectly healthy bodies from other groups seem “unhealthy”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, BMI was developed &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17890752/"&gt;nearly two centuries ago&lt;/a&gt; using data from a small sample of white, European men. Although some efforts have been made to adapt ranges for certain ethnic groups, for example, &lt;a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/health-survey-england-additional-analyses/ethnicity-and-health-2011-2019-experimental-statistics/overweight-and-obesity"&gt;NHS guidance&lt;/a&gt; lowers the BMI thresholds for increased risk of diabetes in Asian and black groups, BMI still fails to account for differences in body composition, fat distribution and baseline risk among individuals in our diverse society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When significant healthcare decisions – such as access to &lt;a href="https://reproductive-health-journal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12978-024-01891-1"&gt;fertility treatments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11488359/"&gt;certain surgeries&lt;/a&gt; – are based on BMI, we should expect it to be an accurate and fair measure, developed and validated in populations that truly represent the people it is applied to. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, healthcare professionals would have access to more detailed measures such as blood tests, imaging scans, and detailed lifestyle information. These are costly and time consuming, but they reveal much more than a height-to-weight ratio ever can. Until better measures are widely available, BMI will continue to be used, but studies like this underline the need to refine how it is interpreted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Danish data is still preliminary. More details and further research will be needed before drawing firm conclusions. But the headline message stands: being very thin is dangerous, and carrying some extra weight may not shorten life. The real lesson is not that thin is bad and fat is good, but that BMI alone is a fragile measure of health.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

But scientists have now documented a case where the virus stayed inside one man’s body for over 750 days, more than two years. This rare case was linked to an individual living with advanced HIV, whose immune system was too weak to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When the body cannot clear the virus&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient, who was not receiving antiretroviral therapy, carried the SARS-CoV-2 virus from mid-2020 until mid-2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40706602/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Researchers &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;collected eight clinical samples during this period and sequenced them to track how the virus behaved inside his body. His immune system, severely compromised, became an unusual environment where the virus could survive and evolve continuously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the virus changed inside one person&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed something extraordinary. Over two years, the virus accumulated 68 consensus and 67 subconsensus mutations. Some of these mutations occurred in the spike protein, the same region that helped Omicron become so infectious worldwide. In fact, 10 mutations matched positions later found in the Omicron lineage, and nine of them were present before Omicron was even officially identified in late 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A personal infection, not a global threat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus stayed largely confined to this one patient. Researchers found no evidence of onward transmission in the community. Some mutations were rare in public databases, suggesting the virus may have adapted so specifically to the patient’s body that it lost the ability to spread easily to others. In other words, the infection became a private battleground between one immune system and one evolving virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for the future&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that persistent infections in immunocompromised people may play a role in shaping viral evolution, offering insights into how new variants like Omicron could emerge. It also underscores the importance of access to timely HIV treatment, vaccines, and close monitoring of such long-term infections. Beyond science, it is a reminder that gaps in healthcare can have ripple effects that extend far beyond individual patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case is not just a scientific record; it is a human story about vulnerability, strength, and the urgent need to strengthen health systems. A virus that lasted more than 750 days inside one body tells us as much about medicine as it does about society’s responsibility to protect its most fragile members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is based on findings published in The Lancet (2024).

							&lt;p&gt;Let's skip the toxic positivity about aging. Yes, sixty is the new forty, wisdom is beautiful, and plenty of people run marathons at seventy. But bodies change. Physics doesn't care about inspirational quotes. After sixty, certain things that once required no thought become negotiations, then struggles, then impossibilities—unless you're among the genetic lottery winners who age like fine wine while the rest of us age like milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't doom and gloom. It's recognition. Because pretending these changes don't exist doesn't make them disappear; it just makes people feel like failures when biology does what biology does. Sometimes the kindest thing is honest acknowledgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Reading menus in mood lighting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restaurants seem to have collectively decided that ambiance means darkness. After sixty, those &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/what-is-presbyopia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;presbyopic changes&lt;/a&gt; that started in your forties accelerate dramatically. Even with reading glasses, deciphering a menu in candlelight becomes archaeological work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You find yourself using your phone's flashlight, angling the menu toward the single tea light, or just ordering what you remember from last time. The waiter's recitation of specials becomes crucial because at least sound waves don't require &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542189/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;accommodation reflex&lt;/a&gt;. It's not vanity keeping you from stronger prescriptions—it's that even the strongest readers can't compete with restaurants' commitment to atmospheric obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Getting up from the floor gracefully&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember dropping to the floor to play with kids or pets? After sixty, the descent might still be manageable, but the return journey requires strategic planning. You need something to push against, pull up on, or roll toward. The graceful pop-up is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't just about strength—it's about &lt;a href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Proprioception" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;proprioception&lt;/a&gt;, balance, and joint flexibility all declining simultaneously. Your brain still remembers how to stand quickly; your knees laugh at the suggestion. You develop new strategies: always sit in chairs with arms, avoid floor-sitting cultures, master the art of the assisted rise without making it obvious you're struggling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Hearing conversations in busy restaurants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background noise becomes foreground chaos. After sixty, presbycusis doesn't just reduce volume—it specifically attacks the frequencies that separate speech from noise. Restaurants become acoustic nightmares where everyone sounds like Charlie Brown's teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start choosing restaurants based on acoustics rather than food. Booths over open tables. Early dinners when it's quieter. You become expert at lip reading and context clues. "Did he say 'grape' or 'great'?" becomes a constant internal dialogue. You laugh at jokes a beat late, hoping you guessed the punchline correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Sleeping through the night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bladder becomes an alarm clock nobody asked for. After sixty, you're up at least twice, sometimes more. It's not just about prostate enlargement or weakened pelvic floors—though those contribute. Your entire sleep architecture changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep decreases, REM becomes fragmented, and your &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5841578/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt; shifts earlier. You wake at 3 AM with stunning regularity, then can't fall back asleep. By evening, you're exhausted but somehow still awake at midnight. The eight-hour uninterrupted sleep becomes as mythical as unicorns, existing only in memory and mattress commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Remembering why you entered a room&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doorway effect—that phenomenon where crossing a threshold erases your purpose—intensifies dramatically after sixty. You stand in the kitchen, spatula in hand, wondering what culinary mission brought you here. The &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4015335/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;working memory&lt;/a&gt; that once juggled multiple objectives now drops balls constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not dementia (usually). It's normal cognitive aging where processing speed slows and attention divides less efficiently. You develop coping mechanisms: retracing steps, saying purposes aloud, making lists for three-item grocery runs. The young laugh at their occasional senior moments; after sixty, senior moments become the default setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Recovering from a night of drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-drink maximum isn't puritanism—it's survival. After sixty, what used to be a mild morning headache becomes a two-day recovery period. Your liver processes alcohol more slowly, dehydration hits harder, and sleep disruption cascades into the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You become the person nursing one wine glass all evening, adding ice cubes nobody judges anymore. The days of "rallying" are over. Now, a wild night means staying up past ten, and the price for exceeding your new, pathetic tolerance is paid with compound interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Maintaining muscle without constant effort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarcopenia is cruel. After sixty, you lose &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4066461/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;3-8% of muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; per decade, and that's if you're trying. Skip the gym for a month, and your body interprets it as permission to begin decomposition. What took years to build disappears in weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unfairness stings: you need muscle more than ever for balance and bone protection, yet maintaining it requires twice the effort for half the result. Young people grow muscle thinking about weights; you lift religiously just to slow the inevitable slide toward frailty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Regulating temperature normally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're freezing, then sweating, then freezing again. After sixty, your &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6098859/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;thermoregulation&lt;/a&gt; becomes as reliable as weather predictions. Your internal thermostat breaks, leaving you layering and unlayering like a neurotic onion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot flashes aren't just for menopause anymore. Night sweats soak sheets. Cold penetrates bones. You understand why Florida exists, why grandparents keep houses at 78 degrees, why that cardigan becomes permanent. Your comfort zone shrinks to about three degrees, and you're never actually in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Seeing clearly at all distances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progressive lenses become necessary evil. But after sixty, even they can't solve the &lt;a href="https://www.reviewofoptometry.com/article/presbyopia-understanding-the-inevitable" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;accommodation problem&lt;/a&gt; completely. You need readers for books, different readers for computers, distance glasses for driving. Your nightstand looks like an optometry display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst part? The constant swapping. Reading a menu requires one pair, seeing the waiter another. Working means computer glasses, but checking your phone needs different magnification. You develop a glasses hierarchy, chains around necks, pairs in every room. Clear vision becomes situational rather than standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. Trusting a fart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one nobody discusses, but everyone experiences. After sixty, the sphincter muscles weaken, sensation dulls, and what feels like gas might not be. That confident release you've performed thousands of times becomes Russian roulette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You develop new protocols: bathroom first, trust later. Long car rides require strategic planning. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7684943/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Laughter becomes risky&lt;/a&gt;. The cough-sneeze-cross-your-legs maneuver becomes automatic. It's humiliating and universal, the great equalizer that makes billionaires and paupers equally cautious about intestinal pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These impossibilities aren't death sentences—they're adjustments. The body that carried you through decades of casual abuse finally presents its bill. Some people's bills are smaller, blessed with genetics that laugh at aging. But for most of us, sixty marks when "I can't" replaces "I choose not to."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strange comfort is universality. Everyone heading down this path faces similar indignities. The CEO who terrorized boardrooms now squints at menus. The marathon runner plans bathroom routes. The professor who lectured without notes writes everything down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting these changes isn't giving up—it's growing up. The alternative to aging with limitations is not aging at all, which seems worse. So we adapt, accommodate, and occasionally rage against the dying of capabilities we took for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what they don't tell you: once you stop fighting these impossibilities, you find peace in the possible. Energy once spent denying reality redirects toward what remains. And what remains, though different and diminished in some ways, can still be enough. Not the same, not what you'd choose, but enough.&lt;/p&gt;

I scanned the page. Until it was clear I wasn’t seeing anything. Not a single word. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZXTUUPXGD5HBZDA6JJ4GDRVTQY"&gt;Anyone who’s heard the “C-word” and their name in the same sentence will confirm this: You go deaf. You hear the next few words, but you don’t &lt;i&gt;hear&lt;/i&gt; them. Because &lt;i&gt;cancer&lt;/i&gt; reverberates in your brain like a gong until, well, it fades. However long that takes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WEUHM3DBX5DGDAVXQXKT5VO32Y"&gt;It took weeks after hearing in early July that cancer was discovered in my prostate for me to begin fully hearing again, to begin thinking again without my brain interrupting: “You have cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EUNRZ5Y7YFFXBLMIIWCJLPYX5M"&gt;It blinds you, too. I learned that while sitting in my urologist’s waiting room before our first conversation about my options. My treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="THLE3GWPZRCSJO3UP552RX7ZXU"&gt;Options are a blessing and a burden — especially when life rests with the choices.

Of having benefitted from years of regular checkups and PSA tests. In May, I learned my latest test had spiked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="S7P5BYEVCVHPLLQ656BVO44NU4"&gt;“It’s a blessing&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; you know,” my primary physician shared. “Now, you know the fight. And you can’t fight an enemy you can’t see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GJVAW2VBN5CH3BPOXWLV6YDEFE"&gt;Still, I couldn’t yet see the options. My wife took the sheet, pulled out a pen and began reading. Within moments, she scratched out the first option: Active Surveillance. “…a course of no active treatment…” was about as far as she got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DDHMLO3XTBFO3FSNLU6IHIQ6HI"&gt;“Oh, hell naw,” we both might have said simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SKQ3JXPDYVGDNDOCJNGROP6UUM"&gt;In the urologist’s office, we listened politely as he explained the option. My cancer, he said, was “slow-moving” (whatever that meant) and that I’d get another PSA test in six or so months and if my levels had risen, I could get another biopsy and….blah, blah, blah. That last part is pretty much all I heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JZ7W2IGWXRG23MGBXAC5JJM5XU"&gt;“Get this thing out of me,” was my resounding thought. Wife’s, too. So, we moved on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KE5P4DFOOJBRLBV6LQ7Q7GJKAU"&gt;Of the remaining options, the urologist further explained robotic surgery and radiation. We asked lots of questions — as did my daughter, who was in the room via FaceTime from Los Angeles, where she lives. (My son was travelling and unable to join.) We heard all the pros and cons. We asked more questions. For well over an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CETAO6GPNFHGRNPJOQJH7O4OCU"&gt;As we were wrapping up, my urologist, with whom we’d shared our Christian faith, asked: “Do you mind if I pray with you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RZZUEWYB5VC33PLDECKQDST5TY"&gt;We prayed. Right there in his office. A few minutes later in the waiting room, we prayed again with an elder from our church who had come for support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CWF7HDE2DVBHHP52TZESSM3HYM"&gt;One week later, I publicly&lt;a href="https://www.al.com/news/2025/07/johnson-i-have-prostate-cancer-and-the-faith-to-beat-it.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; shared my diagnosis and declared having the faith to beat it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="N7LKXLAVFFB3DFM5XAUWPBROVE"&gt;I was not completely surprised. My father died in January 1969; I was 11 years old. Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of death among U.S. men. One in every six Black men will be diagnosed with it in our lifetimes, and we’re 2.1 times more likely to die from it than white men, according to&lt;a href="https://zerocancer.org/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; Zero Prostate Cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Men with a father, son or brother diagnosed with prostate cancer are up to three times more likely to develop the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="C52MT3JPIVHRNI4FGX25FZMYZI"&gt;Men like me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5HD3S3DHFNCQTCHBHVQAFGNNGY"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read my Conquering Cancer Chronicles columns &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.al.com/topic/cancer%20chronicles/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HEW6O2HAMFCDNM4XSA7UMECS7Y"&gt;Throughout those early weeks after learning of my diagnosis, I gripped tightly onto my faith, which has been a lifelong journey. In my youth, our family belonged to historic Vernon A.M.E. Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the only structure that survived the 1921 Race Massacre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24" data-gaid="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7XEDS7SF7JEOTJS2XRR5VS7LYE"&gt;Those seeds have been growing — in fits and starts, I confess.

One of the first scriptures that struck me was&lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2012%3A9&amp;amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; 2 Corinthians 12:9&lt;/a&gt; — “… my power is made perfect in weakness…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-31" data-gaid="inarticle-31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="M5EBZVEVOBEAZHYHWPBEV5UB3I"&gt;Yet I just as quickly pursued &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; plan. And even neglected one of my “go-to” scriptures, one I wear on a silver chain around my neck:&lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040%3A31&amp;amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; Isaiah 40: 31&lt;/a&gt; — “… those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength…,” reads one version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-32" data-gaid="inarticle-32"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PKWGU2BRNFGN5ANPQDXJAFOW6Q"&gt;Reads another: “…those who wait….”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-33" data-gaid="inarticle-33"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RHXUMXROXVB2FLRBO4WCFKKDKE"&gt;Of course, I sought other medical opinions. After reviewing the results of my biopsy, a urologist said, “If you were my patient, I’d recommend active surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-34" data-gaid="inarticle-34"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UGNS7B2HBVDQ5MRFL34DOGP2T4"&gt;Yeah, our &lt;i&gt;hell naw&lt;/i&gt; option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-35" data-gaid="inarticle-35"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="42VTPWPZNNAKTMH4HVF34QT44Q"&gt;Another urologist, a longtime friend and prostate cancer survivor (he opted for surgery), added that active surveillance was “a viable option” for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-36" data-gaid="inarticle-36"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PCIIKG2QAVB75BL3J6AUTRWRKA"&gt;That’s when I began to seriously ponder it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-37" data-gaid="inarticle-37"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OVHHYMJMYZBTFA6YG2KOEOQZHA"&gt;I informed my primary urologist that I was leaning toward active surveillance. “At some point,” he said, “you’re probably going to need treatment. But I do think it’s safe to watch for now.” For more comfort, he sent samples from my biopsy for a&lt;a href="https://www.veracyte.com/decipher-prostate/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; Decipher test&lt;/a&gt;, which gauges through genetics the level of risk of the cancer metastasizing within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-38" data-gaid="inarticle-38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5YZHPULZHNDLFB3SB5RMXU7AKA"&gt;I waited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-39" data-gaid="inarticle-39"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DFTCHPHCOVADDPMETWNF26WCVM"&gt;In early August, I attended the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists, of which I’ve been a member for 40 years. I rarely walked a few steps without a fellow member stopping me and sharing their prostate cancer journey. Many had conquered it through surgery, some through radiation. I listened and thanked them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-40" data-gaid="inarticle-40"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IV6O5PPZO5CJ5KVFR3HUZRGVNY"&gt;I shared with a few that I was considering active surveillance. Only one recommended against it. “It could break away and spread,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-41" data-gaid="inarticle-41"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="P6ZVGCBAZNFBFNXMYJUPM7JZQI"&gt;I knew.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for: &lt;/strong&gt;Constipation. “Kiwis deserve an honourable mention as they are nature’s best laxatives. Paediatricians in New Zealand don’t bother with prescribed laxatives – they just puree the whole kiwi,” says Dr Stokholm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fibre content:&lt;/strong&gt; 3.5g per fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as soluble fibre, kiwis contain an enzyme called actinidin, which helps move food through the digestive tract. Eat the skin for an extra hit of insoluble fibre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The different types of fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know that there are two main types of fibre: soluble and insoluble? They are both important to health, and one isn’t better than the other – which is why it’s important to include both in your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Soluble fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When mixed with water, soluble fibre forms a gel-like consistency, which is why it’s sometimes referred to as viscous fibre. It acts like a sponge and helps sweep cholesterol out of your intestinal tract,” says Bardwell. “Good sources include oats, beans, lentils, bananas, figs and pears. Soluble fibre is especially good for slowing the rate that food leaves your stomach, which can be helpful for keeping you feeling full, managing appetite and regulating blood glucose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Insoluble fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our bodies can’t completely break down insoluble fibre. Instead it passes undigested through our gut, working its magic by bulking up our stools, preventing constipation, and helping to excrete waste matter the body no longer needs,” says Bardwell. “Good examples include cauliflower, oat bran, green beans, celery, nuts and seeds. Insoluble fibre is particularly prevalent in the skins of fruit and vegetables, so avoid peeling potatoes, parsnips and carrots.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’d like to find out ideas for recipes and fibre swaps, Dr Camilla Stockholm shares recipes on Instagram at @whatyourdoctoreats, and Emma Bardwell shares tips at @emma.bardwell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Both groups tended to report elevated levels of emotional distress in social situations, but only individuals with autism showed lower levels of emotional concern for others. The researchers also introduced a new way to distinguish between these overlapping conditions: a ratio of self-focused distress to other-oriented concern. This metric, they argue, could help improve diagnosis and support strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism and social anxiety are both linked to social difficulties, but for different reasons. People with autism spectrum condition often struggle with understanding and responding to social cues. Social anxiety, on the other hand, involves intense fear of being judged or rejected in social situations. These overlapping traits often make it difficult to distinguish between the two in clinical settings, especially since many autistic people also experience high levels of social anxiety. This overlap has created a need for better tools to tease apart the similarities and differences in how these groups perceive and respond to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key traits involved in social functioning is empathy, which can be broadly divided into two components. Cognitive empathy involves understanding another person’s thoughts and feelings. Affective empathy relates to emotional responses to others, such as compassion or distress. Prior studies suggest that people with autism tend to show lower cognitive empathy and mixed patterns in emotional empathy, with some reports of heightened emotional distress. In contrast, individuals with social anxiety may show high emotional reactivity but impaired accuracy in interpreting others’ mental states. Yet few studies have directly compared these two groups on both forms of empathy, using tools that can separate the different aspects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, researchers at the Bruckner Autism Research Center at Ariel University recruited 105 university students and divided them into three groups. One group consisted of students with a confirmed autism diagnosis. A second group included students with high levels of social anxiety but no autism diagnosis. The third group served as a control sample, reporting neither autism nor elevated anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants completed several standardized assessments, including the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, which measures both cognitive and affective empathy, and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, which evaluates the ability to infer emotions based on subtle facial cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggested clear differences between the groups when it came to trait-based empathy. Individuals in the autism group scored lower on perspective taking and empathic concern compared to the control group. Their empathic concern scores were also lower than those in the social anxiety group. Both the autism and social anxiety groups reported significantly higher levels of personal distress in response to others’ emotions compared to the control group. This suggests that while both groups experience intense emotional reactions in social situations, only the autistic group showed a notable reduction in the ability to feel concern for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the study’s key contributions was the introduction of a novel metric: the personal distress-to-empathic concern ratio. This ratio compares how much emotional discomfort a person feels in response to others’ distress (personal distress) to how much they feel for the person experiencing it (empathic concern). A higher ratio indicates a more self-focused, emotionally overwhelmed response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the autism group had the highest average ratio, followed by the social anxiety group, and then the control group. This ratio was also positively linked to the severity of autistic traits and anxiety symptoms, but only in the autism group. In other words, higher emotional distress relative to empathic concern was particularly associated with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers tested whether this ratio could help distinguish between autism and social anxiety. Using a statistical approach called receiver operating characteristic analysis, they identified a cutoff value of 0.83 on the ratio scale. This value demonstrated good sensitivity, meaning it could correctly identify many individuals with autism, though its specificity was moderate, indicating a moderate ability to rule out autism in those without it. This finding suggests that the PD/EC ratio, while not a standalone diagnostic tool, could serve as a useful screening measure in conjunction with other assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, which provides a snapshot of a person’s ability to recognize emotions from subtle visual cues, the groups performed similarly. All scored within the normal range, and no significant differences emerged. This suggests that state-based cognitive empathy, at least as measured by this task, may not differ meaningfully across these populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers noted that the simplicity of the task might not fully capture the complexity of real-life social interactions, particularly for autistic individuals who may rely on compensatory strategies in structured testing environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We observed a significant difference in empathy levels between the autism and social anxiety groups,” explained study author Esther Ben-Itzchak, the head of the Bruckner Autism Research Center. “Both groups experienced higher personal distress compared to the control group; however, only the participants with autism showed significantly lower levels of empathic concern. This difference was effectively illustrated by a new ratio we developed, called the personal distress-to-empathic concern ratio (PD/EC). This ratio successfully distinguished between autism and social anxiety, conditions that frequently overlap in clinical settings, which was both surprising and exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were also surprised that by using a well-known and widely applied measure, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) in a new way, namely computing the ratio between personal distress and empathic concern, we could provide a fresh application for this classic tool.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings support a growing view that empathy is not a single, unified trait but a multidimensional construct, with different profiles emerging across psychological conditions. In the case of autism, the study suggests a combination of reduced perspective taking and empathic concern, coupled with heightened personal distress. For those with social anxiety, the pattern includes elevated distress without a corresponding drop in empathic concern. These distinctions have important implications for how we assess and support individuals facing social challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also aligns with existing theories about emotional regulation in autism. One model suggests that autistic individuals may experience high levels of emotional arousal in social situations but lack the cognitive tools to manage those emotions effectively. This imbalance may lead to withdrawal or self-focused responses, which can be misinterpreted as a lack of empathy. The current findings add nuance to this picture by showing that lower levels of empathic concern are not necessarily universal but may interact with how individuals experience and regulate emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all research, there are limitations. Most notably, the social anxiety group was identified using a self-report scale rather than clinical interviews, which means some participants may not meet formal diagnostic criteria. The sample also included a relatively small number of women, which limits generalizability across genders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation involves the overlapping nature of autism and social anxiety. In this study, about three-quarters of the autistic group also scored high on the social anxiety measure. Although the authors ran additional analyses to control for this overlap, it remains difficult to completely disentangle the effects of each condition. A follow-up study with larger groups could compare autistic individuals with and without social anxiety, alongside a group with social anxiety but no autism, to better isolate the unique contributions of each condition to empathy profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Incorporating experimental tasks or physiological measures of empathy in future work could enhance the validity and depth of the findings,” Ben-Itzchak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the current findings offer a compelling direction for future research and clinical practice. The PD/EC ratio provides a fresh application of a well-established empathy questionnaire and shows promise as a simple, scalable measure to support diagnostic differentiation. It may also help guide targeted interventions by highlighting specific empathy-related challenges, such as managing distress or building perspective-taking skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see two main directions for extending this work,” Ben-Itzchak explained. “First, we plan to replicate the findings across different populations by including more women in similar young adult samples, as well as examining clinical populations and younger children. Second, we aim to integrate the behavioral questionnaires with physiological markers of emotional regulation (such as autonomic nervous system measures), which could enhance the clinical utility of empathy profiles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first study to directly compare detailed empathy subcomponents in autism and social anxiety, while carefully screening the social anxiety group for autistic traits,” she added. “By doing so, we were able to reveal unique empathy profiles for each condition. Clinically, these insights could support more accurate differential diagnosis, and theoretically, they advance our understanding of empathy as a multidimensional construct. Importantly, our work underscores that while both groups experience elevated personal distress in social situations, the presence or absence of empathic concern may be a key factor that sets them apart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.70075" target="_blank"&gt;Distinct Empathy Profiles in Autism and Social Anxiety: A Comparative Study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sigal Tikochinsky, Esther Ben‐Itzchak, and Gil Zukerman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 10:14:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizAFBVV95cUxNRVp5MzNWUjZoRnRnSUlOcjVJRU1WMVlhRlQ2V0dEWlBqeVprQTFWZ3ZPbWsxRU9ZZ3RCWkZrME02a1ZnQWs1WHdXdnV1aEIzQWNKLWlSYjYzclFWUFpWT0g4SDc2NkJDeWdZNFVjdlM5SkNmNzNhNHppN3pRM1FmSzlkZVo0b0haMkFROUhCYk1OMk5WU2k0Q0YyNi1SR0RORHVFbjY1b3RXbU5PRzNvSUxpR2w1QkFwX0JTMGk3YUl0dTFHRFhXdUtQVEc</guid></item><item><title>救命！我要打破一年一度的家族传统。我的理由为什么注定要激起戏剧性。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/09/family-advice-annual-tradition-health-safety.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmttyxk001k3b7aymzevqha@published"&gt;My partner and I still wear KN95s indoors or in crowds. (We’re both at higher risk for COVID.) I believe masking is the considerate, sensible thing to do, but I understand not everyone feels that way, so I certainly don’t take it personally when people don’t mask around me. But if I’m traveling/sharing space with someone, I do ask that they test for COVID and then mask while we’re out and about. If they can’t or won’t do it, no problem; I just make other plans.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmttyxn001l3b7av6vgp8dm@published"&gt;My family (me, my sister, her husband, and my parents) attends a big indoor festival every year. My parents live close by, so we all stay at their house for the duration of the festival. Last year, everyone agreed to wear a mask. But at the festival, I noticed all of them taking their masks off most of the time. It was too late to make alternate arrangements, so I stayed with them, but isolated and masked around the house.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmttyxo001m3b7ad7f2qbok@published"&gt;This year, I really want to be able to relax and take my mask off in the mornings and evenings. Given what happened last year, I’m not confident they’ll mask again, so I’m planning to rent a hotel room. I know my parents will be hurt by this. I don’t really care if they do or don’t mask when I’m not around, but I’ll admit I’m hurt that they knew it was a safety issue for me, agreed to mask during my visit, and then didn’t. I know they love me, but I felt disrespected, and I spent the festival stressed out about my COVID safety assessment being thrown out of wack.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmttyxo001n3b7aaksgjttv@published"&gt;I want to skip the uncertainty this year. What is the most painless way to broach this subject? Should I book a hotel before or after talking to them? (I think if they seemed genuinely contrite and promised to make a real effort, I would stay with them again, but I’m also not interested in leveraging my presence to extort an apology.) Am I overthinking this? Does masking even matter anymore, now that the government thinks COVID isn’t real??? I’m crashing out here!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="7" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmtu8c0001v3b7a7c3cy8h9@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Let Me Mask You a Question,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmtu99u00233b7axtpqjbuh@published"&gt;I imagine this letter could set off an intense conversation about the risks of COVID, the current availability of vaccinations, and the extent to which asking others to mask is reasonable, given what you noted about the &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/09/covid-vaccine-flu-shots-2025-florida-new-york-robert-f-kennedy-jr.html"&gt;government’s position on the virus&lt;/a&gt;. But none of that really matters when it comes to giving you advice about how to handle the upcoming festival. The way I see it, your goal for attending is to have fun. And it will be very hard to accomplish that if you are:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-list/instances/cmfmtugg8002a3b7a8u11b5lc@published" class="slate-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring your family’s masking compliance (which you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be doing, even if they apologize and promise to do better, especially if they need to eat and drink, aren’t used to keeping masks on all day, and don’t really believe in their importance).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absorbing the bad vibes and eye rolls that come with asking your family to mask at the festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or navigating tension over your choice to stay in a hotel because of masking noncompliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmtv8or002i3b7a6x1iv62f@published"&gt;So just book your room. Your worries about what your parents, sister, and brother-in-law are doing will evaporate, and you will be able to unmask in the mornings and evenings without a care in the world. Then tell your family. Doing what you need to feel comfortable is nothing to be ashamed of.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmtv9yu002q3b7adby1s4zx@published"&gt;That said, I’m going to suggest that you lie about your reason for choosing to stay on your own. Don’t admit that it’s about masking. As I said before, if your family is offended and there’s tension between you all, suddenly the festival will cease to be an enjoyable experience. And if that’s going to be the case, you may as well stay home! So just explain to them that you [fill in the blank]:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-list/instances/cmfmtvctg002x3b7aot1dn3t5@published" class="slate-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had some credit card points to use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have work to catch up on in the mornings and evenings, and need the isolation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haven’t been sleeping well, and thought you’d get better rest with blackout curtains and complete silence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to use the hotel gym&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmtw76x00353b7a5my1nhrp@published"&gt;This approach is dishonest, yes. It’s also fine. This small lie doesn’t harm anyone, and it avoids a lot of potential tension. If you get any pushback when you announce your plans, just breezily say, “I hear you, but I still think it will work better for me. Who doesn’t love a hotel bed?” and then change the topic and start talking about the festival acts you can’t wait to see.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmucjco003v3b7alilmn5n8@published"&gt;My husband and I are retired, and we were enjoying our lives until our next-door neighbors moved away and a couple with three beagles moved in. These dogs bark practically 24 hours a day. Asking the neighbors to control their dogs has earned us nothing but being cursed out and having the door slammed in our face. Our complaints to the city have just resulted in a few citations that obviously have had no impact.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmucjcp003w3b7ajmq5cd1w@published"&gt;At this point, my husband and I could not sell our house to move away, even if we wanted to; no one would buy a house that sounds like it’s next to a dog kennel. My husband has gotten to the point where he says he’s ready to lace some raw hamburger meat with chocolate and raisins and throw it over their fence. Ordinarily, I would be appalled, but the endless barking has gotten to the point where I’ve developed hypertension that I’ve never had before. Assuming he’s serious, do I have permission to look the other way?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmucjcq003z3b7agyemdg31@published"&gt;Repeat after me: I will not encourage or allow my husband to murder an innocent animal—even if the animal is loud. We do not kill dogs. You need to be abundantly clear with him about this, and do everything in your power to stop him if he ever seems likely to follow through on his threats.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmucjcq00403b7ak5gt50oh@published"&gt;Then, put on some noise-canceling headphones on top of the kind earplugs that you shove right into your ear and take 10 deep breaths. You are safe. Your husband is safe. You are just annoyed, and you can survive being annoyed (and not take anyone else’s life) until you figure this out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmucjcq00413b7aykbbj54m@published"&gt;When you calm down and stop plotting crimes, you will realize you have options. Take the time you would have spent averting your eyes as your husband shoved chocolate chips into a hamburger patty and escalate the issue with the city. Maybe physically go to the relevant office and explain the situation. Post on Nextdoor and ask if anyone else is having the same issue and how they’re handling it. Call the local non-emergency number if you haven’t already. Call animal control—and keep calling so your neighbors know you won’t give up. Spend a few weeks keeping a log and audio recording of the noise for your records. And if nothing has helped, bring all of this to an attorney to discuss the potential for a civil complaint. I’d rather see the law involved this way than the alternative: arresting your husband for killing a dog.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmucuqv004i3b7axnnynj9r@published"&gt;Lately, my friend has been a bit depressed. I’ve known her for a long time, so I know that her mom is a bit strict, but sometimes it seems unreasonable. She’s a great friend who has helped me a lot, so now I want to help her, too. I’ve been told all I can really do is be a good friend, but I don’t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmucuqw004l3b7a7gp8k7dd@published"&gt;I read an article sometime in the past decade or so that really stuck with me about how to support someone who’s depressed (I’ve searched everywhere for it to no avail—maybe a reader remembers it and can help me out). The advice was to forget about cheering them up, distracting them, or reminding them that they’re loved— approaches that a lot of us default to when we’re comforting someone—and instead affirm that things are hard for them and you understand that they’re really suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmudxa3006g3b7ao3qytcog@published"&gt;So if your friend says, “I just don’t even feel like doing anything! My mom has ruined my life with all her rules,” don’t say, “Hey, at least you have your health!” or “So many people love you and think you’re great!” or “Don’t worry, things will get better!” Instead, try something like, “I know it must be so hard to live with someone who doesn’t let you have any independence and gets mad at you for normal stuff. Anyone would be upset about that. I hate it for you, and I’m so sorry.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="138" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfmucuqw004m3b7a8q08nupy@published"&gt;Really let her know that you see how bad things are for her. You should absolutely, at the right moment, ask her if there’s anything that would help, and nudge her to get support, too (it sounds like you two are teens or young adults? Maybe her school has counseling services?). And if you start to get really worried about her or think she might harm herself, tell an adult. But affirming how tough things are for her without trying to talk her out of the way she’s feeling may go a long way. So would a reminder that she’s been a great friend to you (tell her about all the specific ways!) and that you want to return the favor. It won’t cure her depression, but it might take away any hesitation she has about opening &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KennedyÂ &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-cdc-announce-new-acip-members-sept-2025.html%20" target="_blank"&gt;tapped Griffin Monday night&lt;/a&gt; to join the civilian Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which recommends vaccines and vaccination policies to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. The panel is slated to meet next on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy in June forced all 17 members of the panel to resign. He promised to pick replacements with strong scientific credentials and without preconceived notions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prominent anti-vaxxer, &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/rfk-jrs-vaccine-skepticism-a-problem-for-sen-bill-cassidy/article_2f66d50e-8f81-4344-8e31-009dd22fa2e5.html" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy was criticized&lt;/a&gt;Â after choosing for the panel several health care professionals who made a name for themselves on conservative media talking against vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also laid off thousands of agency employees, proposed cutting the agencyâ€™s budget, pulled funding for further vaccination research using one of its most promising platforms, and fired the director of the CDC less than a month after she was confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Baton Rouge Republican who chairs the Senate Health Education Labor &amp;amp; Pensions Committee, was &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/healthcare_hospitals/bill-cassidy-calls-for-postponing-vaccine-committee-meeting/article_be2a2046-d5df-4915-a4ad-eb67d2e2c9b9.html" target="_blank"&gt;among those raising questions&lt;/a&gt; about Kennedyâ€™s promises not to undermine the nationâ€™s vaccination protocols. A longtime promoter of vaccinations, Cassidy particularly was concerned that Kennedyâ€™s replacements for the advisory panel didnâ€™t have much experience in the sciences connected to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, after voting to confirm Kennedy to the job, he said the new secretary would consult with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassidy did not respond Tuesday to requests for comments. His committee is meeting Wednesday to take testimony from the CDC director who Kennedy recently fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Jeff &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/national_politics/jeff-landry-clashes-with-bill-cassidy-on-louisiana-vaccines/article_5f2b76fa-c30b-4c7a-b393-d531dcf9af4a.html" target="_blank"&gt;Landry, who has been critical&lt;/a&gt; of Cassidy.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;A native of Poland when it was controlled by communists, Griffin grew up in Canada where her family immigrated. She moved to Baton Rouge with her husband after college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Questioning vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griffin said she initially didnâ€™t question vaccines because, like all medical students, she was overwhelmed with information â€“ â€œlike drinking from fire hose,â€� she said â€“ that basically spread a message of vaccines are good and as a doctor she should just memorize the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="6"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href="https://house.louisiana.gov/H_Video/VideoArchivePlayer?v=house/2022/apr/0412_22_HW%20" target="_blank"&gt;testimony in 2022 before the Louisiana House Committee on Health and Welfare&lt;/a&gt;, Griffin said that she observed in her patients â€œbizarre and rare conditionsâ€� that she couldnâ€™t pinpoint as being caused by the vaccine or by the disease itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;â€œThe average doctor is not asking questions, such as, could this be an aftereffect of the vaccine? And not asking these questions is scary as well as not scientific,â€� Griffin said when she testified in favor of an anti-COVIDÂ vaccine&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy himself testified before the same committee in 2021, before he was health secretary.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In testifying in favor of another measure, Griffin said the hospitals with which she was associated had refused her requests to dig down on the data about the efficacy of vaccinations in general and the COVID medicine in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

Treating &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/10k-steps-a-day-walking-b2735565.html"&gt;10,000 steps per day&lt;/a&gt; as the gold standard for a healthy lifestyle is far more contentious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number stems from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer called the Manpo-Kei, or “10,000 steps metre”. It’s a nice round number, but it’s not one identified by science as the holy grail for health – a 2023 study by the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ugr.es/en/about/news/how-many-steps-take-each-day-reduce-risk-premature-death8000"&gt;University of Granada&lt;/a&gt; suggests that, while more is better, 8,000 is sufficient “to significantly reduce the risk of premature death”​​. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/walking"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; 10,000 steps also takes a fair old while. Even at a decent nick, this task is likely to take you upwards of 90 minutes each day, making it a struggle for busy folks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-31azim-0 eBMXOi nextSwipeIgnore sentry-block"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU sc-wlmftc-0 ccDPKb"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-hKDTPf hmBpZX"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, an alternative walking protocol – colloquially termed “Japanese walking” due to its country of origin – has stepped into the spotlight online. It takes just 30 minutes per day, with fitness coach and content creator &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/coacheugeneteo/?hl=en"&gt;Eugene Teo&lt;/a&gt; claiming it offers “10 times the benefits” of walking 10,000 steps per day in his viral video above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fitness writer, I’ve covered walking extensively, finding it’s one of the best ways to help people of all fitness levels introduce more movement into their regular routine. So, intrigued, I endeavoured to try “Japanese walking” and find out if the impressive health claims around it held water.&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to try the ‘Japanese walking’ method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete the sequence below five times without any breaks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a low intensity (40 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a relaxed pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a high intensity (70 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a brisk pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Japanese walking” protocol comes from a study published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/"&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings&lt;/a&gt; journal in 2007. It was designed to test whether high-intensity interval walking training (IWT) can offer greater benefits than moderate-intensity continuous walking training, in terms of improving thigh muscle strength, peak aerobic capacity (the maximum amount of oxygen you can take in and use during exercise) and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over five months, 60 men and 186 women with an average age of 63 were divided into three groups; no walking training, IWT and CWT (continuous walking training). The CWT group was instructed to walk at 50 per cent of their peak aerobic capacity (a fairly slow pace) and take 8,000 or more steps per day at least four times per week. The IWT group was told to complete the protocol above, four or more times per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among participants who met these conditions, those in the IWT group saw a 13 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, a 17 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, and an eight per cent increase in peak aerobic capacity for walking. This was “significantly greater than the increases observed in the moderate-intensity continuous walking training group”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also found a greater reduction in resting systolic blood pressure in the IWT group, despite the fact they didn’t spend as much time walking each week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion states: “high-intensity interval walking may protect against age-associated increases in blood pressure and decreases in thigh muscle strength and peak aerobic capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest walking trend that could help burn more calories and lower blood pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 iBjbcX"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-87047"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (David Lovelady)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened when I tried Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a full science lab set up at home; what I do have is two legs, a &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-garmin-watch-b1903982.html"&gt;Garmin watch&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of walking experience, so I decided to put these to good use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my Monday lunch break, I took my dog for a 30-minute walk as normal. Then, at 1pm the following day, I tried the “Japanese walking” method on the same looped route, setting my Garmin Vivoactive to record both sessions and taking note of any subjective changes I felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My usual 30-minute walk saw me accrue nearly 3,000 steps, covering 2.12km at an average speed of 14min 10sec per kilometre. My heart rate averaged 85bpm, remaining fairly constant throughout, and I burned an estimated 157 calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As anyone who has owned a dog might expect, there was a good deal of stopping and starting to inspect particularly interesting trees and bollards, and I defaulted to a fairly casual pace amid a busy work day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Japanese walking protocol, my numbers looked a bit different, with my fast pace falling just below 120 steps per minute and my slow pace a few shy of 100 steps per minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I travelled significantly further, covering 2.94km and 3,500 steps at an average speed of 10min 12sec per kilometre. My average heart rate came out very similar (86bpm) but there were noticeable peaks (104bpm) and troughs in line with the high- and low-speed intervals.

He was the lead author on a 2024 paper published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sms.14762"&gt;Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports&lt;/a&gt;, which correlated as little as one minute of high-intensity activity with improved health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the really interesting findings from our paper was that, if you look at people’s highest one minute of activity across each day, averaged across the monitoring period, that was a very strong signal for whether they had one or more metabolic syndrome risk factors [elevated waist circumference, high triglycerides, low HDL (or “good” cholesterol), high blood pressure and high blood sugar] present,” he tells me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another series of studies he worked on, featured in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858465/"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, pointed to the fact that “if you walk at a cadence of about 100 steps per minute, that’s equivalent to what’s called ‘moderate-intensity’, and all of the research in this area suggests that most of the benefits [of walking] accumulate at a moderate or higher intensity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, completing the Japanese walking method four times per week leaves you half-an-hour away from the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity"&gt;World Health Organisation’s&lt;/a&gt; “global recommendations of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week”. Add a couple of short full-body &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; sessions into the mix and you have a decent &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/short-workouts-plan-fitness-dan-john-b2737277.html"&gt;minimalist workout plan&lt;/a&gt; for beginners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/step-count-walking-benefits-10000-day-b2739534.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How your step count became the ultimate modern humblebrag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/step-count-walking-benefits-10000-day-b2739534.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 juTIZT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Completing the ‘Japanese walking’ method a few times each week sets you well on your way to hitting the World Health Organisation’s weekly physical activity guidelines" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-87048"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Completing the ‘Japanese walking’ method a few times each week sets you well on your way to hitting the World Health Organisation’s weekly physical activity guidelines&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Harry Bullmore/The Independent)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential drawbacks of the Japanese Walking method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the information above paints the Japanese walking method in a favourable light – as it should, with the protocol delivering impressive results in a non-intimidating time-span. However, if we are questioning the claim that it is “better” than walking 10,000 steps a day, there are a few further areas to consider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Dr Aguiar’s 2024 paper supported the idea that the “best” walking method for reducing metabolic risk factors involves a combination of high volume (number of steps) and high intensity (walking speed). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Accumulating a high volume of walking throughout the day [8,000-plus steps], then focussing on at least 30 minutes of faster walking or jogging, would be a way to move the metrics in a positive direction and lower your metrics for each of the [metabolic syndrome] risk factors,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I racked up a little over 3,500 steps when trying the Japanese Walking method – less than half of the 8,000 daily steps research has repeatedly linked to many favourable health outcomes, and short of the 5,000 mark often viewed as the threshold for a sedentary lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this method as part, rather than all, of your daily steps could be a better approach for achieving your health goals. However, if you only have 30 minutes per day free, it still offers dramatically more benefits than not moving at all, and improved return on investment over a regular 30-minute walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area where the Japanese walking method loses out to walking 10,000 steps per day is movement regularity. While the former involves a concentrated 30-minute dose of activity, the latter can be spread throughout the day, encouraging you to abandon your office chair and sofa more often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 10-year study of 8,000 people, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30551177/"&gt;American Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, found that those replaced 30 minutes of daily sitting with light activity had a 17 per cent lower risk of dying in that period. This even applied if they accrued these 30 minutes across short intervals throughout the day – hence why your smartwatch is constantly sending you reminders to stand up and move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular movement can also help maintain mobility and reduce stiffness in our joints and muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we’re dealing with an adaptation from stillness, movement is the answer, so any movement is better than just being still,” movement mechanics expert and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetrainingstimulus.com/"&gt;The Training Stimulus&lt;/a&gt; founder Ash Grossmann summarises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final factor to consider is enjoyment. By adding a rigid framework, Japanese walking ensures intensity. However, it also meant I was unable to stop and chat to people in the park or appreciate my surroundings to the same extent. For me, this lowered the stress-busting potential of my walk, sacrificing some of the usual mental health benefits of walking for physical ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/news/health/fart-walk-benefits-type-2-diabetes-cancer-b2744886.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the heck is a fart walk?

But if you can fit one or two quick full-body strength training sessions, regular aerobic activity (like walking) and an occasional dash of more intense exercise into each week, it will stand you in very good stead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is among the most accessible forms of exercise there is, lowering the barrier to entry for exercise for billions of people, which is why I’m always keen to promote it. However, in the modern world, even finding time for a quick walk can be tricky for particularly busy individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese walking method provides a time-savvy way to enjoy many of the benefits of a greater volume of daily walking. Sure, you could enjoy higher-intensity exercise in any number of other forms, from cycling to a HIIT workout, but walking remains the most efficient – you don’t even need a change of clothes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So should you try it? Yes, especially if you’re short on time and looking for a way to squeeze health-boosting movement into your day. And should you stick with it? This depends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy this framework, or find it’s something you can stick to with a good degree of regularity, that’s the ticket to a sustainable movement habit and the many health benefits that come from it. If not, look for an alternative form of moderate- to high-intensity exercise that you find fun, and commit to this instead – consistency is the key to long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps day

4 called "The Health Benefits of Tanning".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The advert's voiceover stated: "New research proves that moderate, responsible use of sunbeds brings major health benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The ad went on to claim a recent University of Edinburgh study found "higher UV exposure whether from sunlight or tanning beds is linked to reduced deaths from cancer and heart disease".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The voiceover continued: "The research also showed that sunbed use was not associated with

cells &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/allergies/what-is-mast-cell-activation-syndrome" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; a part of our immune system. Their usual function is to help protect the body from invading germs (pathogens — like parasites or viruses) or other harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They sit in our tissues, and when they recognize something they think is harmful, they release histamine and other chemicals to activate the immune system and try to flush out the intruder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mast cell activation syndromes are divided into three groups: primary, secondary, and idiopathic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Primary&lt;/em&gt; disorders of mast cell activation usually happen when there’s a problem with the mast cell or its parent cells, which causes an excessive production of mast cells. This problem may occur when there is a mutation in a gene called KIT. These primary disorders of mast cell activation include mastocytosis, monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MMAS), mast cell sarcoma, mast cell leukemia, and mastocytoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secondary&lt;/em&gt; disorders of mast cell activation happen when the body encounters a trigger that causes it to produce too many mast cells. This trigger could:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Involve IgE antibodies, like food, drugs, or venom;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be unrelated to IgE antibodies like drugs, physical activity, stress, or infections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one knows the exact cause of the &lt;em&gt;idiopathic&lt;/em&gt; mast cell activation syndrome. The name comes from the fact that it’s not caused by any other disease or related to a clear allergy. People who have this syndrome might have a hard time pinpointing the exact thing that triggers the symptoms, and new triggers might come up a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, many different symptoms affect lots of the body’s systems all at once. These can happen after eating foods, smelling certain fragrances, exercising, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some key symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swelling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Itching&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rashes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inflammation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flushing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Constipation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sweats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abdominal pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But MCAS may also cause symptoms that involve the brain and nerves, including memory problems, headaches, balance problems, fainting, brain fog, anxiety, shortness of breath, mood swings, heart palpitations, and, as we learned from the study, can lead to a life-threatening reaction called anaphylactic shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1ik70pg/comment/mbk4xxq/?context=3" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; our Redditor left under another post, she mentioned that her MCAS comes with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, or POTS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This condition results in too little blood getting to the heart when she stands up after lying down. It causes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lightheadedness or fainting;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; A quick rise in heart rate, causing it to have 30 more beats per minute or a heart rate of over 120 beats per minute.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this woman’s case is no joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Some people do fake their illnesses, but MCAS…?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="6-27" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/anaphylaxis-from-bil-served-food-mil-fight/?image_id=6-27.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="“They Weren’t Real Burgers”: Woman Goes Into Anaphylactic Shock After BIL Lies About The Food" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/anaphylaxis-from-bil-served-food-mil-fight/?media_id=6-27" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/6-27.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9351140" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/6-27.jpg" alt="“They Weren’t Real Burgers”: Woman Goes Into Anaphylactic Shock After BIL Lies About The Food" title="“They Weren’t Real Burgers”: Woman Goes Into Anaphylactic Shock After BIL Lies About The Food" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/close-up-photo-of-a-stethoscope-40568/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pixabay/Pexels (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine how big the problem of people faking illness really is, a team of researchers conducted a study based on survey data from &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/the-netherlands" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;975 adults participated in the &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpne0000303" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, and even though many believe that faking illness is something that happens only very rarely, the results paint a different picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The respondents said they believe about one in every three people (31.2%) fake illness to achieve some sort of goal. Participants also reported that 22.7% had a person in their family who had done this, 24.9% knew someone like this among their &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/relationships/friends/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt;, and 15.4% said such a person was part of their neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highest percentage was reported for colleagues at &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/relationships/work/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; (38.9%). About 14.3% of participants in the study even admitted that they had faked illness themselves, with 55% having faked physical symptoms, 7.4% having faked mental symptoms, and 37.5% having faked both physical and mental symptoms. Most people who had faked illness themselves felt guilty about it (80.6%), and a few also felt that it was thrilling (16.5%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, tricking a doctor into writing you a note so that you can skip work is one thing. Faking a condition like MCAS in front of everyone you know for your entire life would be… a much bigger act.

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists"&gt;GLP-1 agonists&lt;/a&gt;—so-called “&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/media-player/glp-1-agonists-wonder-drugs-of-the-21st-century/"&gt;wonder&lt;/a&gt; drugs” like Ozempic or Wegovy that help individuals lower blood sugar levels and lose weight, among other things—yield significant results for some patients, but not all. People’s motivations to overeat may play a role in this, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To investigate why some people don’t benefit from GLP-1 agonists as much as others, researchers observed 92 participants with type 2 diabetes in Japan during their first year of taking GLP-1 drugs. Their &lt;a href="https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=u001.MdVeKMXe-2Bu-2BITFqnYKpwpYrG9aSJSXpvhXXGDX3ObsnegShxWQwqHODanc6H738E-2Bo8T8fCv1nPHsNZ52emeEe-2BHuu-2FLxRs7AQVij7YVTC3A2m0tVYz0-2FTsrQ6P5OQMI-2BEBR5flHCMVKYVhSKbIKJoTfpIDJePzLuuFb0wmYz4s-3DD9Nu_yB8pNXz8iKogugC36vxXF8jd5h9-2FtEOBOP0lptxNzsvZWv-2BQhQD6pakquPhDw34AAcftjWXS1UdOtUBR4U0ym99LGcTup4DuQ9qw8a6GqxwcbCmXo2ztgoMdqoTzqBpjswa4BKOOqLXZk5iwEJ1uf4aD7QM5y6lIhLnkIyJjblOIbI7KYmRFMeQXmvNQkdcH-2FvObYsP3fRFoxx-2FB7II3QyCNS3yYhFYaCuB2HyTkP6nAgoBk9KqZqOwnRoGMP2pdA93EBBQW4fGg40k-2Fy2FTpmWIYvsic3Ns5HLPcxe1vgcgYgGes-2FWRnBBbNXVH11d1D3RHqxUA8CaRzcyIYQ6nvl9VbubSvMCXpQlCPmcWM5uAkEr-2FBd8kldQYRfSMGjkyMsdAmLmVx7SxMwCRoDu6tA-3D-3D"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;, published today in Frontiers in Clinical Diabetes and Healthcare, suggest that people who overeat due to external reasons—such as the sight or smell of delicious food—had greater chances of responding well to the drugs in the long term than people who overeat for emotional reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Who will benefit most from GLP-1 drugs?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Pre-treatment assessment of eating behavior patterns may help predict who will benefit most from GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy,” Daisuke Yabe, senior author of the study and a professor of diabetes, endocrinology, and nutrition at Kyoto University, said in a Frontiers statement. “GLP-1 receptor agonists are effective for individuals who experience weight gain or elevated blood glucose levels due to overeating triggered by external stimuli. However, their effectiveness is less expected in cases where emotional eating is the primary cause.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team revealed this by gathering data on the participants’ body weight and composition, diet, and information such as blood glucose, cholesterol levels, and relationship with food at the beginning of the treatment, three months after, and one year after. They focused on emotional eating (eating in response to negative emotions), external eating (eating because the food looks good), and restrained eating (controlling one’s diet to lose weight). While it might seem contradictory, excessive restrained eating can actually result in disordered eating, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the year, the participants experienced a statistically significant loss of body weight and lowered cholesterol levels and body fat percentage without changing skeletal muscle mass. While blood glucose levels ameliorated, the improvement wasn’t statistically significant. There were, however, some variations depending on eating behaviors. Three months after the start of the treatment, participants reported more restrained eating and less external or emotional eating. By the end of the year, though, participants had returned to their original restrained and emotional eating habits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One possible explanation is that emotional eating is more strongly influenced by psychological factors which may not be directly addressed by GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy,” said Takehiro Kato, second author of the article and a researcher from Gifu University, “Individuals with prominent emotional eating tendencies may require additional behavioral or psychological support.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;External eating lessened over the year of treatment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Participants reported decreased external eating throughout the entire year, and individuals that claimed high levels of external eating at the beginning of the treatment saw the greatest benefits in blood glucose levels and weight loss. On the other hand, the team didn’t identify any association between emotional or restrained eating scores at the beginning and drug benefits by the 12-month mark.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While our study suggests a potential association between external eating behavior and treatment response to GLP-1 receptor agonists, these findings remain preliminary,” explained Yabe. What’s more, the team’s study was observational, and participants self-reported information, meaning the researchers revealed a potential association, not a causation.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Further evidence is necessary before they can be implemented in clinical practice. Should future large-scale or randomized controlled trials validate this relationship, incorporating simple behavioral assessments could become a valuable component in optimizing treatment strategies,” Yabe concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

The kidneys play a critical role in filtering waste, balancing fluids, and maintaining electrolyte levels in the body. Poor dietary choices, particularly at breakfast, can place unnecessary strain on these vital organs. While breakfast is often hailed as the most important meal of the day, not all options are beneficial for kidney health. Some common breakfast foods can exacerbate kidney issues, especially for those with pre-existing conditions. Understanding which breakfasts to avoid can help protect renal function and support long-term well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How To Know If You Have Kidney Stones?

A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/press-room/ultra-processed-foods-lead-to-higher-risk-kidney-disease-new-study-finds" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in the National Kidney Foundation found that higher consumption of processed meats was associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to their high sodium and phosphorus content. These meats are high in sodium, which can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of kidney disease over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, processed meats contain preservatives like nitrates and nitrites, which have been linked to kidney strain. Regular consumption may also contribute to inflammation and oxidative stress, further burdening the kidneys and increasing the likelihood of long-term complications. For individuals with compromised kidney function, consuming these products can accelerate kidney damage. A healthier alternative is to opt for fresh, unprocessed protein sources, such as eggs, legumes, or plant-based options, which provide nourishment without overloading the kidneys. Limiting processed meat intake and focusing on a kidney-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can further support long-term kidney function and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sugary cereals&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugary cereals are convenient, but their high sugar content and artificial additives can negatively affect kidney health. Excessive sugar intake can contribute to obesity and insulin resistance, both of which are major risk factors for kidney disease. Moreover, these cereals often lack essential nutrients, providing empty calories that fail to support overall health. Swapping sugary cereals for whole-grain options like oatmeal, bran flakes, or muesli can provide fiber, vitamins, and minerals, promoting better kidney function while keeping you full and energized throughout the morning, while also stabilizing blood sugar levels, supporting heart health, and reducing long-term risks associated with chronic lifestyle-related conditions. Over time, replacing processed cereals with nutrient-dense alternatives also helps maintain digestive balance, supports immune resilience, and lowers inflammation, offering comprehensive benefits that extend beyond kidney protection and overall metabolic health. Including fresh fruits, nuts, or seeds as toppings further enhances nutritional value, boosts antioxidant intake, and offers natural sweetness without overloading the body with harmful refined sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which breakfast food do you think is most harmful to kidney health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Flavored yogurts&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoghurt can be a healthy breakfast option, but flavored varieties often contain added sugars, artificial flavors, and phosphates that may silently strain the kidneys over time. High sugar intake contributes to weight gain, insulin resistance, and metabolic issues, all of which increase the likelihood of developing kidney-related problems in the long run. Phosphates, especially those found in processed dairy products, can disrupt mineral balance and harm renal function when consumed frequently or in large amounts. Regular overconsumption of these additives not only burdens the kidneys but may also trigger low-grade inflammation, raise blood pressure, and aggravate existing conditions like diabetes, obesity, or cardiovascular disease. Choosing plain, unsweetened yoghurt and pairing it with fresh fruits, chia seeds, or a handful of nuts delivers beneficial probiotics, essential vitamins, and nutrients that support both digestive and kidney health, without the risks. It also helps maintain gut microbiome diversity, improves nutrient absorption, and supports sustained energy and mental clarity throughout the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pastries and baked goods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pastries, muffins, and donuts may be tempting, but they’re loaded with refined sugars, unhealthy fats, and simple carbohydrates, making them poor choices for kidney-friendly breakfasts. These ingredients cause rapid spikes in blood sugar and increase the risk of obesity, which in turn puts extra pressure on already vulnerable kidneys. To make matters worse, many commercial baked goods also contain hidden trans fats that trigger inflammation and gradually compromise kidney function. Smarter alternatives include whole-grain muffins, homemade baked treats with natural sweeteners, or options prepared with minimal oil, which can satisfy morning cravings while still supporting long-term renal health and overall wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fast food breakfast sandwiches&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast food breakfast sandwiches are convenient but often come with excessive sodium, preservatives, and unhealthy fats. These components can elevate blood pressure, increase cholesterol levels, and strain kidney function over time. Processed meats combined with refined bread further exacerbate these risks, leaving the body more vulnerable to lifestyle-related diseases. Preparing a homemade breakfast sandwich with whole-grain bread, fresh vegetables, and lean protein offers a safer, more nourishing alternative. This approach maintains the convenience of a quick breakfast while supporting kidney health, boosting overall nutrition, and reducing long-term risks associated with processed fast food options. Thus, it is best to avoid or consume in moderation whenever possible, as regular dependence on such meals may gradually weaken metabolic balance, compromise heart health, and increase overall vulnerability to chronic disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Instant noodles&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instant noodles may seem like a quick breakfast solution, but their high sodium content poses a significant risk to kidney health. Flavor packets often contain salt and MSG, which can cause dehydration and increase blood pressure—both harmful to renal function. Over time, regular consumption of such high-sodium foods can contribute to kidney strain. Instead, preparing a homemade soup or noodle dish with low-sodium broth, fresh vegetables, and lean protein provides a nourishing, kidney-friendly start to the day without compromising taste or convenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also Read: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/aiims-gastroenterologist-reveals-10-gut-friendly-snacks-for-daily-health-and-digestion/articleshow/123844292.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;AIIMS gastroenterologist reveals 10 gut-friendly snacks for daily health and digestion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fruit juices&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercial fruit juices, while often marketed as healthy, can contain high levels of added sugar and lack the fiber found in whole fruits. These sugars contribute to weight gain, insulin resistance, and elevated blood sugar, all of which negatively affect kidney health. The absence of fiber also causes rapid spikes in blood sugar levels. Choosing whole fruits or making your own low-sugar juice allows you to enjoy the natural benefits of fruit while preserving kidney function and supporting overall metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pancakes and waffles&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pancakes and waffles made from refined flour and topped with syrup are high in simple carbohydrates and sugars, which can lead to weight gain and increased blood sugar. Syrups and toppings often contain high fructose corn syrup, which can further stress the kidneys.

Now, we may have a new method for significantly reducing those recurring cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by researchers from the University of Pennsylvania shows that actively targeting &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41568-020-0263-0"&gt;dormant tumor cells&lt;/a&gt; (DTCs) lingering in the bone marrow and other parts of the body can keep patients cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, patients who've been treated for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/landmark-moment-new-breast-cancer-treatment-approved-in-uk"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; are carefully monitored to see if the tumor returns. This new approach doesn't involve waiting and monitoring: instead, drugs are used to attack the root causes of a relapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/no-your-cravings-arent-a-reliable-sign-of-cancer-expert-explains"&gt;No, Your Cravings Aren't a Reliable Sign of Cancer, Expert Explains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now, we just don't know when or if someone's cancer will come back – that's the problem we set out to solve," &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/pioneering-strategy-may-keep-breast-cancer-from-coming-back"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; medical oncologist Angela DeMichele from the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study shows that preventing recurrence by monitoring and targeting dormant tumor cells is a strategy that holds real promise, and I hope it ignites more research in this area."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173643" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173643" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSurvival.jpg" alt="Mouse test chart" class="wp-image-173643 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSurvival.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSurvival-601x415.jpg 601w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSurvival-600x414.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173643" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In human trials and animal tests (shown here), treatment reduced the risk of cancer returning. (DeMichele et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's only in the last few years that these dormant cells &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13058-021-01416-9"&gt;were confirmed&lt;/a&gt; as potential targets for treatment. Other &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04070-6"&gt;recent studies&lt;/a&gt; have pointed to pathways and drugs that might be used to reach DTCs, leading the researchers to hydroxychloroquine (which treats autoimmune diseases), everolimus (an existing anti-cancer drug), or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of a series of tests on 51 people who had previously had breast cancer and were confirmed to have DTCs were quite dramatic. Individually, the drugs cleared up to 80 percent of the DTCs, but together they were even more effective, wiping out 87 percent of the dormant cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the group that took both hydroxychloroquine and everolimus, all of the participants &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-destroy-99-of-cancer-cells-in-lab-using-vibrating-molecules):"&gt;remained cancer-free&lt;/a&gt; after three years. For those who took either drug on its own, the survival rate was still an impressive 92-93 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same positive results were seen in tests on mouse models of cancer, run before the human trials to test the effectiveness of the approach. The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/animal-testing" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73085" data-postid="173640" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;animal testing&lt;/a&gt; also enabled the researchers to get a closer look at the mechanisms by which the drugs were working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Surprisingly, we've found that certain drugs that don't work against actively growing cancers can be very effective against these sleeper cells," &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/pioneering-strategy-may-keep-breast-cancer-from-coming-back"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; cancer biologist Lewis Chodosh from the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This tells us that the biology of dormant tumor cells is very different from active cancer cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-breast-cancer-pill-extends-survival-in-7-year-trial"&gt;breast cancer survivors&lt;/a&gt; have these DTCs left in their system, but for those who do, the early signs for this treatment are promising. The next steps are to run trials with a larger number of participants and to test different drug combinations and doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, breast cancer that comes back is virtually impossible to eliminate completely, which leads to a large proportion of the overall deaths from the disease, casting a shadow over how effectively it can be tackled the first time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The lingering fear of cancer returning is something that hangs over many breast cancer survivors after they celebrate the end of treatment," &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/pioneering-strategy-may-keep-breast-cancer-from-coming-back"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; DeMichele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03877-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s believed that the child caught measles while traveling internationally, according to the Cook County Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the public may have been exposed if they were in Terminal 5 of O’Hare International Airport between about 7:30 a.m. and 11 a.m. on Sept. 11. Health officials are working to identify and notify people who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who were possibly exposed should notify their health care providers if they are unsure about their vaccination status. If they develop symptoms they should talk to their health care providers or a health care facility before going to a medical office or emergency department, so the facility can take steps to prevent other patients and health care providers from being exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the county health department said the department could not share information about the child’s condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and can spread through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. Symptoms can include a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes and can appear up to 21 days after a person is exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles is one of the most contagious viruses we know, and it’s entirely preventable,” said Dr. Simbo Ige, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, in a news release. “This case is a serious reminder that vaccination is not just about individual protection, it’s a critical community responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are considered 97% protective against the measles, and one dose is considered 93% protective. Children typically receive the first dose of the vaccine, or the similar measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine at age 12 to 15 months, and the second dose from ages 4 to 6.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/04/30/cook-county-measles-cases/"&gt; first case in suburban Cook County&lt;/a&gt; this year was confirmed in an adult in late April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also comes amid continuing debate over the use of vaccines driven by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who’s overhauled a federal immunization advisory committee that makes recommendations about the use of vaccines. Kennedy was a noted vaccine skeptic before leading HHS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That advisory committee is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday and consider recommendations regarding the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, there were measles outbreaks across the country, with the largest in Texas. The Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt; announced the end of that outbreak&lt;/a&gt; last month.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;This year there have been 1,454 confirmed measles cases across the country and three deaths, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. That’s the most cases since the disease was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, according to a &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/us-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000"&gt;U.S. Measles Tracker&lt;/a&gt; hosted by the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can receive measles vaccines at Cook County Health community health centers by calling 833-308-1988. The Chicago Department of Public Health also offers free measles vaccines at its immunization clinics. Walk-ins are welcome, but people are encouraged to register for appointments at &lt;a href="https://getvaxchi.chicago.gov/s/login/?language=en_US&amp;amp;ec=302&amp;amp;startURL=%2Fs%2F"&gt;Getvaxchi.chicago.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials recommend people vaccinated before 1968 check with their health care providers about revaccination. People who’ve had only one dose of the vaccine, have a weakened immune system, or who have been exposed in an outbreak should consult a provider about immunization, according to the county health department.&lt;/p&gt;

(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEPATITIS B IS A HIGHLY TRANSMISSIBLE, blood-borne disease that’s been called a “silent killer” because it can become chronic without presenting symptoms for many years—until, one day, it leads to cirrhosis or liver cancer or both. In the 1970s, arguably no state faced a bigger hepatitis B threat than Alaska, where the virus had exploded within its Native population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The infection rate in some tribes was as high as 15 percent, at a time when the national rate was no more than 1 percent. The toll was devastating, and included children who had contracted the disease at birth or during infancy, usually from their mothers or adults in close contact. In the worst cases, the infected would die from liver &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181212003306/https:/anthc.org/news/hepatitis-history-among-alaska-native-people-part-1-in-a-series-on-anthc-support-and-prevention-against-liver-disease-and-hepatitis/" rel&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; before reaching adulthood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.globalhep.org/dr-brian-mcmahon" rel&gt;Brian McMahon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a physician who treated some of those cases, told me on the phone about one particular patient—“18 years old, 4.0 GPA, with a full ride to University of Alaska. She wanted to be a teacher.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She kept having these stomach pains,” McMahon explained, but put off a visit to the doctor:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally—two weeks before she’s supposed to graduate—she came in to see me. She had a big mass in her liver. I biopsy-tested her for hepatitis B. She was positive, and it was liver cancer. And so I sat with her two weeks later when she died a horrible, painful death. And I’ll never forget that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hope finally arrived in the early 1980s in the form of a highly effective, easily produced vaccine. State officials working with tribal leaders acted quickly, first by distributing the shot to newborns and children and caregivers—and then, within a few years, to the full tribal population.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; It was a feat of logistics and medicine, with intrepid health workers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://magazine.publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/hepatitis-B-in-alaska" rel&gt;delivering doses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to some of the state’s most remote regions by single-engine plane.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/08/170809214158.htm" rel&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; were dramatic. Alaska’s hepatitis B rate plummeted. Symptomatic cases among children within the tribes effectively &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21618565/" rel&gt;disappeared&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We haven’t had [hepatitis B-related] cancer in kids for thirty years,” said McMahon. “There are no more kids who have hepatitis B. It’s amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The success of hepatitis B vaccination in Alaska got the attention of federal officials, as did a universal hep B program that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X99004600" rel&gt;Taiwan launched&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; at around the same time. Among those who noticed were the scientists then serving on the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which makes official recommendations for what vaccines should be on the “schedule” of inoculations that the U.S. government urges all people to follow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 1991, ACIP recommended hepatitis B shots be given to the entire population, with the first of three doses administered right after birth in order to protect newborns. That became U.S. policy and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37300309/" rel&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; nationally have been almost as striking as they were in Alaska. Acute hepatitis B cases among children have fallen by more than &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/well/hepatitis-b-vaccine-rfk-jr.html" rel&gt;99 percent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; nationwide, with rates declining among adults as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The campaign against hepatitis B ranks as one of the most important public health accomplishments of the past few decades, as the CDC’s own &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6019a5.htm" rel&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; proclaims. But that achievement is now in serious jeopardy, thanks to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s crusade against vaccination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unraveling could start as soon as this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Bulwark</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 23:43:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOdjRlZUs5WHVsU0J4SkREVnZpOVhwa0Y5QlRRdDRzN1VmUWliOGdfOEtVUGpqYzlBaFRNdFNXWnNoUVZPWVItWEpfdXJFeF9FMHk4am1RdHQzRlljZHExLXpkZTMzdnJpQmdiNFFvQjJWSnZ5RkMxZ3pGNlZITWpzWmZFVllSeU4tSWJQZHFn</guid></item><item><title>对数百万人的皮肤状况的担忧与自杀风险增加有关-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15088407/skin-condition-atopic-eczema-suicide.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adults who suffer from the most common form of eczema are significantly more likely to express suicidal thoughts, concerning new research reveals today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Atopic eczema is a common inflammatory condition that causes patches of itchy, cracked and dry skin, which can blister and bleed during a flare-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, presented at the European Academy of Dermatology &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/us-congress/index.html" id="mol-b4aa7610-9312-11f0-927c-1bbfcff83e02"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, leading dermatologists examined the link between atopic eczema and suicidal ideation in over 30,800 adults, across 27 countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As one of the largest investigations of its kind, the study included over 15,200 people suffering from the condition, matched with 7,968 controls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eczema patients were grouped based on when they were diagnosed with the condition—childhood, adolescence or adulthood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were then asked to complete a questionnaire which recorded the severity of their symptoms, experience of skin-related stigmatisation, and whether they had ever experienced any suicidal thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results showed that just over 13 per cent of adults with the common condition reported suicidal ideation—compared with just 8.5 per cent of adults without atopic eczema—regardless of symptom onset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Delphine Kerob, dermatologist and contributing lead author said: 'The results highlight that the effects of atopic eczema are more than skin deep, with suicidal thoughts representing a serious and frequent concern that is often overlooked by healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;More than 5.2million adults and 2.5million children in the UK currently suffer from moderate to severe cases of eczema &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By identifying the main risk factors behind suicidal ideation in this population, we hope this study will help healthcare professionals better recognise and address these challenges, supporting patients' overall well-being more effectively.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beyond the physical symptoms of the condition, its impact on mental health is increasingly recognised, alongside the associated risks of available treatment methods such as topical steroids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many who suffer from the condition experience debilitating anxiety, depression and social stigma, alongside the daily challenges of managing their condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As such, younger adults, particularly those under 30, were more likely to report suicidal thoughts, as were individuals with obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clinical features were also found to play a major role, with moderate to severe symptoms linked to an increased risk of suicidal thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also noted that those who struggled with consistent sleep disorders, such as mixed insomnia—difficulty falling and staying asleep—and more stigmatisation were at a higher risk of such ideations.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kerobe concluded: 'These findings reveal a critical insight from our study, which seeks to uncover the hidden, long-term impact of living with common inflammatory skin conditions such as atopic eczema.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 5.2million adults and 2.5 million children in the UK are thought to suffer from moderate to severe cases of eczema. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; A close-up view of Atopic Dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema, one of the most common forms of eczema&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is generally first treated with prescription washes and steroid creams to reduce swelling and redness. In more severe cases, immunosuppressant drugs – which can negatively affect immunity and the liver – are given. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Tony Bewley, a consultant dermatologist at Bart's Health NHS Trust in London, added: 'Atopic dermatitis often has a greatly underestimated psychosocial burden for the patients and their families'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Both adults and children frequently face stigmatisation, loss of confidence and bullying, sleep deprivation and overwhelming itch, which may impact their performance at school and work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In severe atopic dermatitis, patients often suffer from depression, anxiety and even suicidal ideation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, the NHS&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13655387/Breakthrough-jab-eczema-disappear-gets-green-light-NHS.html"&gt; announced the roll-out of a pioneering new jab called lebrikizumab&lt;/a&gt; which soothes painful symptoms by targeting a protein in the body that causes inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prof Bewley welcomed the new treatment that is now available on the NHS, saying: 'The addition of this therapy is an important step forward and most welcomed for patients and clinicians alike.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
