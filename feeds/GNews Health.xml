They fear it will undermine the importance of the lifesaving inoculations and further damage trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The government’s premier public health agency has stressed vaccination as the safest and most effective measure to control the spread of some contagious diseases, including the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/17/cdc-nomination-measles-vaccine-safety-kennedy/" target="_blank"&gt;growing measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NIF66XZMWJBSTPLF2DPENGUXAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It seems the goal of this administration is to prove that vaccines cause autism, even though they don’t,” said Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation, a nonprofit organization that funds autism research. “They are starting with the conclusion and looking to prove it.

Vitamin A is not an effective way to prevent measles; however, two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are about 97 percent effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

She has survived 180 rounds of chemo and seven surgeries &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rates of colorectal cancer in Americans under 50 have risen over the past two decades. This graph shows the latest year for which data is available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This has changed from 50 when Ms Comer was diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://abc7news.com/post/screen-early-bay-area-woman-stage-4-colon-cancer-shares-dire-message-colorectal-awareness-month/16076982/#:~:text=%22I%20was%20told%20that%20I,during%20an%20interview%20in%202023."&gt;ABC 7 News&lt;/a&gt; if the recommended colon cancer screening age had been moved just a few years earlier, 'I would have been inconvenienced for maybe 18 months, but it would not have been a death sentence.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-c28441d0-08ac-11f0-a088-dfe2cc6ff8d4" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; is the fourth most common cancer in the US and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and 52,900 will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes 19,550 cases and 3,750 deaths in under-50s.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2030, colon cancer is estimated to be the biggest cancer killer in patients under 50. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are still largely unsure what's behind the epidemic, but obesity, diets high in processed meats and sugar, sedentary lifestyles, and environmental exposures like microplastics and antibiotics are several of the top theories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While bloody stool, abdominal pain, weight loss, and changes in bowel habits are tell-tale signs of colon cancer, Ms Comer had no symptoms leading up to her diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, the only sign of trouble was elevated liver enzymes during a blood test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver enzymes are proteins that help the liver produce and break down bile and rid the body of toxins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer that has spread to the liver damages protective cells and can lead to excess enzymes flooding into the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Comer told ABC 7 News that following her diagnosis, she would spend eight to 11 hours three days every other week in doing chemotherapy treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also underwent seven surgeries to remove the tumors from her liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after 180 rounds of chemotherapy and between 60 and 70 scans, Ms Comer made the decision to stop treatment and enter hospice care at home this year due to the lasting wear and tear from chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'It wasn't a difficult decision. There were no treatment options that were working and the chemo was making me sicker so I couldn't recover.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Comer, pictured here with her husband and daughter, is now in hospice care and focusing on encouraging young patients to get screened for colon cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Comer said that over the years, her advice to young people and doctors has stayed the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm really a pain in the butt. I keep saying the same thing - screen early,' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for diagnosing colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This involves inserting a long tube with a camera on the end into the anus and passing it through the rectum and colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the doctor finds polyps during the exam, they will remove them and test them for cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society recommends getting a colonoscopy every 10 years starting at age 45. Prior to 2021, this began at age 50, making Ms Comer miss the age requirement to catch her cancer before it spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Comer said: 'To the problem in your life, you are the answer and you are the solution. You have to figure it out.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she is no longer seeking treatment, she noted her husband and 17-year-old daughter have helped keep her from giving up on life itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Who would want to leave, who would want to leave this beautiful world with all this kindness?' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 20:22:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPaEdLdkE3eHZFOV9BdkZiZXdKdUJvaXVRU0pDQ0ZKSXc0UkcxeVdndmduMEZJUUR1Umx0YlN6dGdqRmVselVXVHpGLTQtVXhCTlY2d29kamN0STZvcXU5Y1p6ZERsVWpYc2k3LVpQRTR4aGRQTHE4MTBIWXZCRlJscjdSZ2Z6WGtMVVRkWC11c3NzUnlnMUZ5SElRR2V1TWFG0gGmAUFVX3lxTE5kdF9YR1lFZmxmX2p3UGZiZkhtWmFORGQtV3BVSVFTazRka2xrSDJMLVZqa0VjcmxrdWxoUmJPckFoT1p3VkJZQ0ZqRVVRU1JaSWtudk1FSHpDaTE2ZFVqcnU5a3FqWG9oQ3JYdnVsTmVHaVM1a3RFSkJhdHhPWjA5aV84QW83cFkxUXpvc2lBNUVxLURLdnVfNnNMV3RBYjZXTzNLMkE</guid></item><item><title>A person with measles traveled in D.C. while contagious, officials say - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE5YYmZaT0wyZ3U2Z0YteVJVa09oZF9HZ2NRVFRBS2piWUFDVW43Rm5kYkY2UEljdXZiMXNNNzNyNGh4LU50WU54eDhoQ0lTa3g0UEFJck1iY2Q1d0dkSnNjWDQ0bmJ1MHdHSGNuMGU0UjBEalpmYkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VHCJM6NJLNHC7ERPCDRZNBXO4Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;D.C. public health officials on Tuesday reported that a person with the measles recently traveled within the District while they were contagious after flying in from Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VIX6UDOOVNGEJAMQVUU6ZMEICA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The individual rode on an Amtrak train&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;on March 19, walked through the concourse at Union Station and went to an urgent care in Adams Morgan&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a few days later, according to the D.C. health department, which is warning people of potential exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JWQIOAVBWNEYXDB3DS4WBFQJHQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;D.C.’s chief epidemiologist, Brittani Saafir-Callaway, said the person was not contagious when they flew into Reagan National Airport.

                                        &lt;p&gt;An outbreak of measles in southwest Kansas continues to grow. &lt;a href="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;State health data shows&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 10 people in Grant, Stevens and Morton counties, all under the age of 18, have tested positive for measles since the start of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kansas Department of Health and Environment first &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1483" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported a measles case in Stevens County March 13&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, stating it was the first measles case in Kansas since 2018. But the state’s measles dashboard also shows two cases, one in January and one in February. A state health department spokesperson said those cases were “retrospectively identified” and part of the current outbreak. The eight other cases were recorded this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said during a health conference in Wichita that state officials are closely monitoring the outbreak and are ensuring infected people are isolated. She also urged Kansans to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are safe and effective,” Kelly said. “I have two kids. They were both vaccinated. They are alive and well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classify a measles outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as three or more cases linked to each other. This makes Kansas one of the most recent states with a measles outbreak. &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Texas has the largest outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with more than 300 cases of the measles. Health experts say the disease can lead to serious complications, hospitalization or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC has confirmed one death amid the outbreak in Texas. In New Mexico, health officials are investigating the cause of death for a person who tested positive for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing spread of the illness in Kansas comes as state lawmakers in Topeka are considering a bill that includes loosening vaccine requirements in child care regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill is aimed at reducing specific fees and training requirements for early child care facilities. But a provision expands religious exemptions for vaccines that are required for child care programs. The Kansas House recently approved the bill with bipartisan support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansas vaccine advocates argue the requirement changes could reduce vaccine rates amid a growing public health issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more unvaccinated children you have in a setting, the more likely it is that measles or whatever will go through the population,” said Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director for Kansas Interfaith Action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is measles? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles, also known as rubeola, is a highly contagious infection caused by a virus. It spreads through the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dana Hawkinson, medical director of infection and prevention at the University of Kansas Health System, said the illness can linger in the air for up to two hours. He said he expects to see the number of cases in Kansas rise because of how easy measles spreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the decrease in overall vaccine rates, I think we have to expect there to be more cases,” he said, “Just because the less people vaccinated means more people that are susceptible to the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said measles can potentially cause severe health problems, like pneumonia. In rare cases, it can lead to brain damage and deafness. He said one in five people who contract measles are hospitalized and it can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can be a very devastating disease,” Hawinkson said. “It is unfortunate because we know we have the best proactive safety measure, and that is the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials say nine of the 10 Kansans who tested positive for measles were unvaccinated, and one was under vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;Symptoms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said measles symptoms typically start like a common cold. An infected person may have a fever, sore throat, runny nose and mild cough. About two to three days later, the person may develop white &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/symptoms-causes/syc-20374857" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;spots in their mouth, known as Koplik spots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. About three to five days later, the person will develop &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/photos.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a red, splotchy rash&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which Hawksinson said usually starts on a person’s head and face and then spreads downward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/measles-keeping-family-safe.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Experts say if you suspect you or your child has measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s best for them to stay home away from other people. Hawkinson said it’s also important to call ahead before bringing someone with a possible infection to the doctor, emergency room or urgent care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is really best to call ahead so that they can take those preparations into account, so that they can protect other people in those areas,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state health department website has more information about &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/1501/Measles-Rubeola#:~:text=Providers%20%26%20LHD%20Resources%20Table%20Section,not%20wait%20for%20test%20results." class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;measles and what to watch for.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measles prevention&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson encourages full vaccination against measles as the best way to avoid contracting the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a vaccine that has been used for five to six decades,” Hawkinson said. “It has a great history of safety. It has a great history of effectiveness at preventing disease and especially the complications of disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;There are two types of vaccines for measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: MMR and MMRV. Children need two doses of either vaccine to be fully protected against measles. The first dose should be administered when a child is between 12 and 15 months old and the second should be when a child is between four and six years old. However, the MMVR second dose can be administered as early as 3 months after the first dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said now is a good time to check you and your family’s vaccination status. He said unvaccinated children and adults or people who didn’t receive both doses of the vaccine should consider getting them now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

About 90% of Kansans are vaccinated for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, state lawmakers have challenged vaccine requirements in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kansas House recently approved a &lt;a href="https://www.kslegislature.gov/li/b2025_26/measures/hb2294/?link_id=1&amp;amp;can_id=ddf8202ea341214def057893c988d994&amp;amp;source=email-action-alert-tell-your-house-member-to-protect-the-kansas-supreme-court&amp;amp;email_referrer=email_2662630&amp;amp;email_subject=action-alert-on-childhood-immunizations&amp;amp;&amp;amp;" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bill&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aimed at reducing or eliminating fees and training requirements for child care facilities. That bill includes a provision that adds moral and ethical opposition to the definition of religious exemptions for vaccines that children are required to get before attending child care programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director of Kansas Interfaith Action, said the change is reckless. He said most major religions approve of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In anti-vax sentiment, sometimes it’s called 'religious' but actually, it is more about people’s fears,” Rieber said. “There’s not really a religious basis for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieber said changing the definition of religious exemption for vaccine requirements at childcare facilities could also open the door to changes for K-12 public schools, which require several other vaccines for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieber said he supports expanding access to affordable child care in Kansas, but the amendment could harm vaccinated and unvaccinated kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest issue is the potential for this to be a precedent that would then take away the ability of the school or the facility to actually protect their children by not allowing unvaccinated children to be in the setting,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers on the House floor did not discuss the details of the bill or the reasons to include the vaccine exemption changes before voting to approve it. The bill is now in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

That priority has fallen by the wayside in the second Trump administration, with the termination of a number of grants related to HIV in the past week. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most notable was the sudden withdrawal of $18 million per year for a program dedicated to understanding how to diagnose, treat, and prevent HIV infections and AIDS in adolescents and young adults, who account for about &lt;a href="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-and-adolescents-and-young-adults#:~:text=Adolescents%20and%20young%20adults%20(AYA,get%20it%20through%20sexual%20transmission." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;19% of new infections annually&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. On Friday, the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Intervention was notified that the two &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/ywiR4GL71UiO0skW5-ySbQ/project-details/10993597#description" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/ywiR4GL71UiO0skW5-ySbQ/project-details/10880572#description" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;grants&lt;/a&gt; that support its operations had been halted by the National Institutes of Health, in a move that legal experts say may be found illegal if it were challenged in court.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers say the loss of the program — during the third year of the seven-year grants — would mean ceasing research that could help expand the populations that might benefit from emerging treatments. The network has two ongoing trials studying a potential preventive &lt;a href="https://idhi.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/upcbnu4171/files/imported/ATN%20168%20HAPPY%20Lay%20Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;treatment for HIV and pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and assessing the effectiveness of sexual health counseling and behavioral therapy to &lt;a href="https://idhi.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/upcbnu4171/files/imported/ATN%20170%20IMPACT%20Lay%20Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reduce HIV transmission in adolescents who use stimulants&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-salt diets triggered depression-like behaviors in mice by activating specific immune cells that produce the inflammatory molecule IL-17A.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When researchers removed these immune cells or used mice genetically unable to produce IL-17A, the depression-like behaviors didn’t occur despite high salt consumption.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;While promising, this mouse study used extremely high salt levels, and more research is needed before applying these findings to human depression treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NANJING, China —&lt;/strong&gt; Too much salt has long been blamed for heart problems, but new research suggests it might harm our minds too. Scientists from Nanjing Medical University have discovered a surprising connection between high-salt diets and depression-like behaviors in mice, potentially explaining why depression rates continue rising alongside our consumption of processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team found that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/salt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;excessive salt intake&lt;/a&gt; triggers specific immune responses in the brain that can lead to behaviors resembling depression. Their findings, published in &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jimmun/vkaf019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal of Immunology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, offer a biological explanation for previously observed connections between processed food consumption and mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Depression&lt;/a&gt; affects millions worldwide, with lifetime prevalence reaching 15-18% in many populations. Modern Western diets, especially fast food, contain dramatically more sodium than home-cooked meals—sometimes exceeding homemade options by 100-fold.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-salt-depression-connection"&gt;The Salt-Depression Connection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the study, mice fed high-salt diets showed behaviors remarkably similar to those experiencing chronic stress. They explored less, displayed heightened &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and spent more time motionless during tests measuring “behavioral despair”—patterns that parallel human depression symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers investigated the biological mechanisms behind these behavioral changes. High-salt diets significantly increased production of Interleukin-17A (IL-17A), an immune signaling molecule, particularly in specialized immune cells called gamma delta T cells (γδT cells).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous research had linked elevated IL-17A to depression, but this study reveals a direct pathway from dietary salt to increased IL-17A production to depression-like &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To confirm this connection, the team tested mice genetically modified to lack the ability to produce IL-17A. These mice showed no signs of depression despite consuming high-salt diets. Even more convincingly, when researchers removed the specific immune cells that produce IL-17A, the animals no longer developed depression-like behaviors on high-salt &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/high-salt-diet-weakens-immune-system-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-humans"&gt;What This Means for Humans&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While conducted in mice, the research has compelling implications for human health. Population studies have already shown links between high-salt diets and increased depression rates. This study offers a potential explanation for those observations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/western-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;average American diet&lt;/a&gt; contains about 3,400 mg of sodium daily—far exceeding the American Heart Association’s recommended maximum of 2,300 mg. Fast food meals often deliver an entire day’s worth of recommended &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sodium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt; in a single sitting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first research connecting diet and mental health. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mediterranean-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mediterranean diets&lt;/a&gt; rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, olive oil, and lean proteins correlate with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-finds-mediterranean-diet-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lower depression rates&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, diets heavy in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/processed-foods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, sugars, and unhealthy fats tend to increase depression risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The distinctive aspect of this study is identifying a specific biological pathway connecting diet directly to depression-like behaviors. This precision opens doors to potential new treatment approaches targeting the immune system rather than just brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-simple-ways-to-reduce-salt-intake"&gt;Simple Ways To Reduce Salt Intake&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current depression &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/fish-oil-for-depression-stem-cell-study-shows-supplement-effective-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;treatments&lt;/a&gt; typically focus on neurotransmitter imbalances using medications like SSRIs or on changing thought patterns through therapy. The discovery that dietary factors might contribute to depression through immune pathways represents an important shift in how we might approach mental health care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Applying these findings doesn’t necessarily require waiting for new pharmaceutical treatments. Simple dietary changes are accessible to most people:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing processed food intake&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Eating more &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/home-cooked-meals-healthy-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;home-cooked meals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Checking food labels for sodium content&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Using herbs and spices instead of salt for flavoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some health professionals already recommend the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/dash-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) for patients with high blood pressure. This diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and reduced sodium. This new research hints such approaches might benefit mental health too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond individual choices, these findings could influence public health policies around sodium reduction in processed foods. Some countries have already implemented such regulations: the United Kingdom’s salt reduction program has achieved a 15% decrease in average salt intake since implementation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed before definitive conclusions about &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/salt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;salt reduction&lt;/a&gt; as a depression treatment in humans, this study adds to mounting evidence that what we eat affects both body and mind. For those struggling with depression, these findings don’t suggest dietary changes should replace established treatments like therapy and medication, but they highlight diet as an important complementary factor in mental health care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This research was conducted entirely in mice, not humans&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Mouse depression models may not fully represent human depression’s complexity&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The behavioral tests measure approximations of depression symptoms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-extreme-salt-levels"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extreme Salt Levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study used extremely high salt concentrations (8% in food, 1% in water)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;This far exceeds even high-sodium human diets&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unclear if more moderate salt increases would produce similar effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-female-only-subjects"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Female-Only Subjects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only female mice were studied&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sex differences in immune response and depression are well-documented&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Results might differ in male subjects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-correlation-vs-causation-questions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correlation vs. Causation Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study shows a pathway but doesn’t prove this is the only mechanism&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Other factors beyond IL-17A may contribute to depression in high-salt scenarios&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The relationship may be more complex in humans with varied diets and lifestyles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clinical-application-hurdles"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Application Hurdles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No evidence yet that reducing salt intake reverses depression symptoms&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;No human clinical trials testing this specific mechanism&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unknown if targeting this pathway would be effective in humans already experiencing depression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study used female C57BL/6J mice aged 8-12 weeks, including normal mice and some genetically modified to lack RORγt (a protein necessary for IL-17A production). Researchers split the mice into groups receiving either normal diet (0.5% salt) or high-salt diet (8% salt in food plus 1% salt in drinking water) for 5-8 weeks. They also included a group subjected to chronic restraint stress (placed in a restrictive tube for 4 hours daily for 3 weeks) as a comparison model known to induce depression-like behavior. To assess depression-like behaviors, researchers employed four behavioral tests: the open field test (measuring exploration and anxiety), elevated plus-maze test (measuring anxiety), and tail suspension and forced swimming tests (both measuring “giving up” behaviors). They then examined tissues from blood, spleen, and brain using flow cytometry and microscopy to identify changes in immune cells and IL-17A production. In some experiments, they depleted specific immune cells (γδT cells) using antibodies to see if this would prevent depression-like behavior in mice eating high-salt diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mice on high-salt diets developed significant depression-like behaviors comparable to those seen in chronically stressed mice. They showed reduced exploration in open spaces, increased anxiety behaviors, and greater immobility (a sign of “giving up”) in behavioral tests. These changes happened without affecting blood pressure, body weight, or food intake, suggesting the effects weren’t due to physical health problems. High-salt diet increased IL-17A production in the spleen, blood, and brain. Further analysis showed γδT cells (specifically a subset called γδT17 cells) were the main source of this increased IL-17A. When genetically modified mice unable to produce IL-17A were fed high-salt diets, they didn’t develop depression-like behaviors. Similarly, depleting γδT cells in normal mice using antibodies protected them from developing depression-like behaviors despite consuming high-salt diets. These results strongly suggest high-salt diets trigger depression-like behaviors through IL-17A production by γδT cells.&lt;/p&gt;

Department of Health on Tuesday confirmed a positive case of measles in a person who visited various locations in the District while contagious.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;The D.C. Department of Health confirmed Tuesday a positive case of measles in a person who visited various locations in the District while contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unidentified person traveled throughout the nation’s capital within the last week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential exposure sites outlined by the District’s health department include two Amtrak locations and an urgent care location:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amtrak Northeast Regional 175 Train Southbound
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 19, 7:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amtrak Concourse, Union Station, 50 Massachusetts Ave, NE
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 19, 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MedStar Urgent Care Adams Morgan, 1805 Columbia Road, NW
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 22, 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone not immune to measles and who traveled to the potential exposure sites during the noted dates and times are urged to contact their health care provider or DC Health at 844-493-2652 for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DC Health’s alert comes weeks after health officials in Maryland confirmed three measles cases across &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/local/2025/03/measles-case-confirmed-in-howard-co-resident-who-passed-through-dulles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/health-fitness/2025/03/2-more-cases-of-measles-confirmed-in-maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Prince George’s&lt;/a&gt; counties. All three cases had been contracted by residents who had traveled abroad, and were not related to the outbreaks in New Mexico, Texas or Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details surrounding the latest confirmed measles case have not yet been provided. It remains unclear whether international travel is at all linked to the D.C. case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measles case was previously reported in the District in &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/health-fitness/2024/07/single-case-of-measles-confirmed-in-dc-area/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;July 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="p1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are the measles?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;The measles is a highly contagious disease that spreads through the air when an infected individual breathes, coughs or sneezes, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;More than often appearing in two stages, symptoms don’t typically begin to show until after the seventh day that the virus was contracted. Symptoms range from high fevers, runny nose, watery eyes to tiny white spots that appear in one’s mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the measles rash makes up the second stage of symptoms, appearing on the face along the  hairline before spreading throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC explainer&lt;/a&gt; indicates that “if one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected.” It notes the best protection against the virus is the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, better known as the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers tracked rats’ hippocampal neuron activity for up to 20 hours and found that memory patterns first echoed the learning phase and then gradually shifted to match the recollection phase upon waking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reorganization, observed during non-REM sleep, involved a dynamic change in the neurons representing reward locations—some stopped firing while others became active. These changes not only reinforced the memory but may also free up neurons for storing new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-REM Sleep Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Memory reactivation and optimization occurred during non-REM sleep, while REM sleep seemed to counteract this effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Representational Drift:&lt;/strong&gt; Neuronal activity shifted from mimicking the learning phase to the recall phase, helping refine memory storage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; After sleep, fewer neurons were involved in recalling reward locations, suggesting an optimization of memory representation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;IST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A good night’s sleep helps us remember recently learned information, ‘engraving’ our memories. This is also true for animals, as remembering for example the location of food resources is essential for their survival. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists can examine this role of sleep in the lab by training lab mice or rats about their environment using various memory tasks. In such experiments designed for spatial learning, the animals must learn and subsequently remember the location of food rewards in mazes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite extensive research aimed at understanding the neuronal mechanisms that favor learning, memory formation, and recollection, many questions about these essential brain functions remain unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers from Professor Jozsef Csicsvari’s group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) have probed the key roles of sleep stages in optimizing memory recollection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wirelessly measured neuronal activity patterns in rat brains for up to 20 hours of sleep, considerably extending previously reported measurement times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We showed that the neuronal assemblies in the early stages of sleep reflect recently learned spatial memories. However, as sleep progresses, neuronal activity patterns gradually transform into those seen later, when the rats awaken and remember the locations of their food rewards,” says Csicsvari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping—and remembering—reward locations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past work showed that a cortical brain area called the hippocampus is important both for exploring and maintaining routes in an environment (called spatial navigation), and for spatial learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal neurons keep track of the animal’s location by firing at specific locations, thus forming a cognitive map of the environment. Animals use this map to navigate in space while updating it during learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this process, the reward locations play an instrumental role, becoming disproportionately represented on the animals’ cognitive map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following spatial learning, the hippocampus plays an important role in enhancing memory during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does so by reactivating recently learned memory traces. Previously, the Csicsvari group showed that the more often a specific reward location is reactivated during sleep, the better the animal remembered that location when they woke up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, when the team blocked the reactivation of a specific reward memory, the animals were unable to recall the respective location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reorganizing neuronal patterns during sleep engraves memories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientists could so far only examine the reactivation of spatial memories in shorter sleep periods of two to four hours, the team now achieved such experiments during long overnight sleep. Using wireless recordings, they monitored neuronal activity in the hippocampus for up to 20 hours while the rats rested and slept after a spatial learning paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings were unexpected. We showed that the activity patterns of neurons linked to the reward locations reorganized during the long sleep,” says ISTA PhD graduate Lars Bollmann, one of the study’s co-first authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, when a given reward location was reactivated, not all the neurons that represented that location remained active in the entire sleep. While some did—the ISTA researchers called them a “stable subgroup”—, others stopped firing during later sleep stages. But at the same time, a new group of neurons started to fire gradually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most surprisingly, we showed that while the pattern of firing neurons in the early stages of sleep echoed the neuronal activity in the learning phase, this pattern later evolved to mirror the neuronal activity when the rats woke up and remembered where the rewards were located,” adds Bollmann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the team not only observed a drift in neuronal activity patterns during sleep in the frame of spatial learning but also linked it to the process of memory reactivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, they shed light on how sleep helps keep memories fresh. In addition, they showed that this reorganization happens during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep, while REM sleep counteracts it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freeing neurons up for new memories?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What could be the role of this phenomenon—called “representational drift”—that occurs in sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can only speculate in this regard,” says Csicsvari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is possible that memory representations must be formed quickly during learning but that such representations are not optimal for long-term storage. Therefore, a process may take place in sleep that optimizes these representations in sleep to reduce brain resources to store a specific memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In support of this hypothesis, the researchers observed that fewer neurons were linked to a given reward location after sleep than before. Therefore, some neurons get freed up to take in newer memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any new memories must find a way to be integrated into existing knowledge. Frequent repetitions of the new memories as well as partial change in the neuronal code may thus help optimize their integration into existing memory representations,” concludes Csicsvari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present research was conducted at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) by the recent ISTA PhD graduate Lars Bollmann and former ISTA postdoc Peter Baracskay (co-first authors) together with former ISTA postdoc Federico Stella, currently an Assistant Professor at Radboud University, Donders Institute for Brain, The Netherlands, and ISTA Professor Jozsef Csicsvari (co-corresponding authors).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cbaaa5afb9aeaab8e5b9a4bfa3ae8ba2b8bfe5aaa8e5aabf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Andreas Rothe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ist.ac.at" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;IST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Andreas Rothe – IST&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2025.02.025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sleep stages antagonistically modulate reactivation drift&lt;/a&gt;” by Jozsef Csicsvari et al. &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep stages antagonistically modulate reactivation drift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal reactivation of waking neuronal assemblies in sleep is a key initial step of systems consolidation. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether reactivated assemblies are static or whether they reorganize gradually over prolonged sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tracked reactivated CA1 assembly patterns over ∼20 h of sleep/rest periods and related them to assemblies seen before or after in a spatial learning paradigm using rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that reactivated assembly patterns were gradually transformed and started to resemble those seen in the subsequent recall session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Periods of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) had antagonistic roles: whereas NREM accelerated the assembly drift, REM countered it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, only a subset of rate-changing pyramidal cells contributed to the drift, whereas stable-firing-rate cells maintained unaltered reactivation patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data suggest that prolonged sleep promotes the spontaneous reorganization of spatial assemblies, which can contribute to daily cognitive map changes or encoding new learning situations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:55:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFAxd0Z6aC1QS1lGSlFDUkN2NFMyYXRjTk1zRUpCSXhVVzc3N19BeXpWWEtqMmZubVlFVFo2bUotb3UxaHZXcjRhS1dZZkZMa3ZYWFVBQjB1RFpwUHllc3JuYllaeU1wdUUyazlHVzl3</guid></item><item><title>On ‘Diabetes Alert Day,’ 80% of people unaware of condition that could help prevent serious health problems - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3AFBVV95cUxOdTFtdEF2Z3J3YUFQeFZETV84eDBVcjg3NTBWSEsxVmg3VkdsSkFvOHJUNFdzSC1xNExDRnVDY2s0dkFmV3pZeEpzNHF3ODE1eWc5VXltaVUtOTJJQ1N2TlU5dF9QOXVpUjZwNE5qQ2V5Z2N3WU5qSF8xV25tTzRyT0ZtZS05bTNvSzdER2FObzFZWFpZZlNvS3g4My1yN0RUMm54Ql9vNFp2MDN2bGEyUlNZUzZzTUpObzV2X0dqcjVLVm44Z181S241dERIblFNdmxETldza1hCOFFa?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;Each year, the fourth Tuesday of March marks Diabetes Alert Day, a day meant to sound the alarm on the prevalence and risks linked to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Diabetes is a disease where a person’s body can’t regulate sugar properly. Over time it can lead to serious health complications, including heart attack, stroke, vision loss, kidney problems and nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year, the fourth Tuesday of March is&lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Diabetes Alert Day&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s several types of diabetes, but the most common one is Type 2 diabetes, which develops over time,” said&lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/providers/kwameakoto" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Dr. Kwame Akoto&lt;/a&gt;, an internal medicine physician at Kaiser Permanente. As for what contributes to diabetes, the keys are aging, family history and genetics, diet and fitness level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, as researchers have learned more about how diabetes progresses, as well as treatment and prevention, doctors have sought ways to prevent patients from developing Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Typically, what we see is people go from normal sugars to what’s called prediabetes,” said Akoto. “And this is when your body starts to have those first triggers of sugar intolerance, and then the process worsens from there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, the American Diabetes Association &lt;a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538537/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-extlink=""&gt;first introduced the diagnostic criteria&lt;/a&gt; for prediabetes to determine the likelihood of someone developing diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Typically, prediabetes has no symptoms,” said Akoto. “According to the CDC, about 38% of American adults — which is about 96 million people — have prediabetes, and we think about 80% don’t know that they have it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the District of Columbia, approximately 3,000 adults each year are diagnosed with diabetes, he said. In Maryland, approximately 28,000 receive the diagnose each year, and in Virginia, approximately 40,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;How to identify prediabetes&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In prediabetes, a person’s blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes, according to the &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/prediabetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. Preventive Task Force, which makes guidelines for us to implement screening with our patients, did recommend for adults between the ages of 35 to 70 who are overweight or obese should be screened at their visits,” said Akoto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory screening involves a blood draw — including a fasting plasma glucose test, which measures blood sugar after an overnight fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The one you’ll most likely see is called a Hemoglobin A1c test, which is a sugar average test that’s looking at your average sugar over eight to 12 weeks,” said Akoto. “That’s probably the one you’ll see most commonly used now, because it gives us so much information, instead of that spot test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Lifestyle changes can prevent diabetes&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a prediabetes diagnosis doesn’t mean a patient will develop diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lifestyle changes are really important,” said Akoto. “With controlling body weight, we do see research shows that 5% to 7% of body weight loss will reduce your risk of diabetes by 58%.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding exercise activities such as walking, using a treadmill, bike riding or resistance training is important in heading off diabetes. “We recommend 150 minutes a week, split up any way that you like,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy diet should include more fruits and vegetables, said Akoto. “These are high fiber foods that slow down how the sugar absorbs in our gut. Lean proteins also have the same effect, so incorporate things like fish, or turkey or chicken.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente operates a yearlong &lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/article/diabetes-prevention-program-2406305" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Diabetes Prevention Program&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to lower the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in participants.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike traditional brain scans taken during rest, this immersive approach revealed distinct patterns of neural communication in ADHD, especially in deeper brain structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows that ADHD-related brain differences become more visible during real-world-like interactions, highlighting the need for more dynamic diagnostic methods.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘During the virtual reality game, there were clear differences in brain network activation for kids with ADHD, particularly in the deep structures of the brain and their connection to cortical areas.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While during functional MRI (fMRI) scanning, subjects were immersed in a world of challenges mimicking those faced by people in the real world. The game was projected onto a mirror, allowing children to play whilst their brain activity was scanned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were then compared with scans taken while they were doing more passive activities like watching a video or simply resting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Interestingly, while at rest, there was no detectable difference between the groups, and there was little difference during video viewing,’ says Salmi, findings which also highlight the value of this novel way of collecting neuroimaging data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘We used to think that abnormal development is mostly a matter of background activity in specific, limited brain regions. But these findings indicate that it’s more to do with inter-regional communication between brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘We found that alterations in brain activity in individuals with ADHD are driven by the human-environment interaction,’ says Salmi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means that psychological testing for ADHD in the clinic, or even just brain imaging research more generally, should take place in situations where the individual is actually doing something that would spark symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmi hopes the study will spark more extensive research, believing that this method could also help us find out what’s behind the sharp rise in ADHD diagnoses and in the development of non-pharmacological treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games and apps are changing our brains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not lost on the researchers that gaming in a virtual environment is an excellent way to explore what’s going on in our brains in a world of screens and social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The brain is a complex system that always tries to adapt to its environment, therefore it’s likely being shaped by TikTok, Snapchat and other apps and games as well,’ says Salmi. Similarly, the virtual world contains toys that can trigger impulsivity, like musical instruments, a soft drink in the fridge or the chance to take a virtual shower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘If the environment is fast paced, with people jumping from one thing to another like a grasshopper, the brain tries to get better at jumping from one stimulus to another,’ he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘But if we become grasshoppers, we can no longer concentrate for two hours when there are very few stimuli. Scanning the brain while it’s active could also give us fresh insight into how our brains are changing.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies for the team include researching children’s brains using smart suits and motion sensors, as well as exploring symptoms in adults in set ups that more closely simulate daily life. He foresees that in the future, symptoms could also be quantified at home, for example using augmented reality glasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmi also points out that while fMRI is at this stage too costly to be used for mainstream diagnostic purposes, as we build more knowledge in this way, diagnosing neuropsychiatric conditions should also become more straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Aalto researchers, the study involved researchers from HUS, the University of Helsinki, the University of Oulu and the Lyon Neuroscience Research Centre in France.

Whereas resting state activity reflecting intrinsic tonic background activity is only vaguely connected to behavioral effects, naturalistic neuroscience has provided means to measure phasic brain dynamics associated with overt manifestation of the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in three experimental conditions, an active virtual reality (VR) task where the participants execute goal-directed behaviors, a passive naturalistic Video Viewing task, and a standard Resting State condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-nine children with ADHD and thirty-seven typically developing (TD) children participated in this preregistered study. Functional connectivity was examined with network-based statistics (NBS) and graph theoretical metrics. During the naturalistic VR task, the ADHD group showed weaker task performance and stronger functional connectivity than the TD group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group differences in functional connectivity were observed in widespread brain networks: particularly subcortical areas showed hyperconnectivity in ADHD. More restricted group differences in functional connectivity were observed during the Video Viewing, and there were no group differences in functional connectivity in the Resting State condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These observations were consistent across NBS and graph theoretical analyses, although NBS revealed more pronounced group differences. Furthermore, during the VR task and Video Viewing, functional connectivity in TD controls was associated with task performance during the measurement, while Resting State activity in TD controls was correlated with ADHD symptoms rated over six months. We conclude that overt expression of the symptoms is correlated with aberrant brain connectivity in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, naturalistic paradigms where clinical markers can be coupled with simultaneously occurring brain activity may further increase the interpretability of psychiatric neuroimaging findings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:23:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE1TTmRrSXVnRW1uT2pUblhSblJEUUFSWmdhd2NpVWpQRVNIOXMxX2VNcnZaQXU5Z1JadkRSMC1kLS1pMTRRX1dPT2ZEcU9qbjc2d2JaNU1MaTR3ZU1xUTNGSUJfWU90c0ljY2tCVw</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Discover How To Flip the Immune “Switch” Against Alzheimer’s Disease - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxOalJaUGlDQkszSEdNd3dQUnlUdzRBRVh0NTdmUDlkbmpVOVpGR2REMjFOS2I1M2l5REVCQ2FiR0ZKTDhxYk01T280aU9Cbkd2TFFyOU1vdTVHZnBZS094cWZVbzRRZGY4cER3ZDN4MThEdnFYRm9HOUowYl94eWNyTWRmdENLT3UxUURhMndGaUcyandkVFJ1eTRlbG1uSHQ4RXdEMw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:12:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOalJaUGlDQkszSEdNd3dQUnlUdzRBRVh0NTdmUDlkbmpVOVpGR2REMjFOS2I1M2l5REVCQ2FiR0ZKTDhxYk01T280aU9Cbkd2TFFyOU1vdTVHZnBZS094cWZVbzRRZGY4cER3ZDN4MThEdnFYRm9HOUowYl94eWNyTWRmdENLT3UxUURhMndGaUcyandkVFJ1eTRlbG1uSHQ4RXdEMw</guid></item><item><title>What I’ve learned from my aunt, who has secondary progressive MS - Multiple Sclerosis News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxOWUpLRnhUS3hhVTkxV1AwVTdEYzBfNjNjTGtLUVFxa09UczRxRTl5eWdPeUc5MVF3QUNpYWJJR1piZHR0Y2pLQXJhaXFsdUljYU8wZnZ6MXhzUDdyd0xqOXdFUUFpSExtamVHQlQwcnVQMVFLM3VtV3dWTGFuZW9kYXFkYVVDeFdKTDlQanZCWHEyQTFJQkR0aFdfTWZmT3JtZURmRmx4dVJUUkRnSElJTjVR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;

					&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 25 of 31&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Chris Delemater’s story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it like to know someone with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS)? Have I learned anything from someone who has it? In fact, my aunt, &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/silver-linings-jennifer-powell/"&gt;Jenn Powell&lt;/a&gt;, who is the brand and marketing manager at &lt;a href="https://bionews.com/"&gt;Bionews&lt;/a&gt;, the parent company of this website, has &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/secondary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-spms/"&gt;secondary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt; — and she is one of the most influential people in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

	
	&lt;div class="bio-article-image-wrapper bio-article-image-wrapper--alignright"&gt;
		&lt;div class="bio-article-image"&gt;
			&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-146285 size-medium" src="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image2-380x259.jpeg" alt="A young woman stands in a kitchen holding a newborn baby boy.

									&lt;/div&gt;
					&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew from an early age that she had a lifelong illness, but only more recently did I come to understand the often grim reality that MS can cause. That said, my aunt has been an absolute &lt;em&gt;champion&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to dealing with her condition. Not only is she physically strong enough to get through the near-constant pain, but she also has the mental fortitude to wake up every day and go on with life without being bogged down by fear or doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She doesn’t allow the knowledge that her MS will eventually progress to bring her down, and she lives her life to its fullest. In my opinion, her reality with MS has made her more appreciative of every day she has lived and breathed on this planet than anyone else I know. In turn, she has lived a more rich and fulfilling life than she otherwise might have if she never had MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her own amazing way, she has turned what may seem to everyone else to be a curse into a true blessing. I aspire to apply this same attitude to my own lifelong condition of Asperger’s syndrome/autism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although MS and Asperger’s syndrome/autism are vastly different, the way we must deal with them is rather similar. The knowledge that I will never quite fit in with everyone else, that my brain is biologically wired differently, and the chronic life-shortening stress I go through is a tough pill to swallow at times.&lt;/p&gt;

									&lt;/div&gt;
					&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in difficult times, I like to apply my aunt’s perspective to my own issues. Instead of dwelling on the negative aspects of my diagnosis, I focus instead on all of the good things it has brought me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hyperawareness of certain stimuli — sights, smells, sounds, and the like — allows me to live a rich and beautiful life, with a vast library of vivid memories and an appreciation of all the experiences that have led to this moment. The gift of my vivid imagination has given me a love of fantasy literature and writing. Being able to write this Community Spotlight piece is another reminder that my diagnosis can be viewed as a gift, not simply a mental disability, like so many others see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, my Aunt Jenn’s way of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/living-with-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;living with MS&lt;/a&gt; has taught me much about my lifelong struggle with Asperger’s syndrome/autism and has brought me a new sense of gratitude. With the right perspective, MS and Asperger’s can both be viewed as gifts rather than curses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Chris Delemater’s aunt Jenn Powell is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;the brand and marketing manager for Bionews, the parent company of Multiple Sclerosis News Today, and also hosts a podcast and wrote &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/silver-linings-jennifer-powell/"&gt;columns&lt;/a&gt; for the site. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s been hard to tell if the bowel movement issues came first or if the diseases caused them, given that the studies were in people who were already sick, says &lt;a href="https://www.moles.washington.edu/faculty/sean-gibbons/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.moles.washington.edu/faculty/sean-gibbons/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sean M.

On the flip side, people in the diarrhea group also had markers of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/inflammation/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/inflammation/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="inflammation" data-node-id="11.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, which can also raise the risk of developing certain diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;As a result, the researchers concluded that bowel movement frequency could be an important indicator of future health issues. Still, Gibbons says that bowel movement frequency doesn’t come up enough in regular doctor’s visits. “We’re trying to change that and push doctors more toward managing this,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-doctors-currently-consider-a-normal-pooping-schedule" data-node-id="13" class="body-h2 css-w63prd emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="13.0"&gt;What do doctors currently consider a “normal” pooping schedule?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The current definition of a “normal” pooping schedule is really broad. Doctors &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/17791-frequent-bowel-movements" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/17791-frequent-bowel-movements" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="generally" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;generally&lt;/a&gt; say that pooping anywhere from three times a day to three times a week falls into a normal range. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“That’s a really wide range,” Gibbons says. “We suspected that there was a narrower range that might be optimal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-might-pooping-a-lot-be-bad-for-your-health" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-w63prd emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;Why might pooping a lot be bad for your health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;There are a few things that happen in your body when you poop a lot. “People who have diarrhea tend to have higher levels of inflammation,” Gibbons says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Chronic inflammation in the body is linked to a slew of serious health complications and diseases, including autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, and neurogenerative diseases, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/conditions/inflammation" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/conditions/inflammation" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (NIEHS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But people who poop a lot also had markers of liver stress. Gibbons says this “makes sense” given that the liver helps to produce bile, which is released into the intestines to break down fats and support digestion. “If we poop fast, we lose more of that bile, so it puts stress on our liver,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-can-pooping-less-be-bad-for-you-too" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-w63prd emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;Why can pooping less be bad for you, too?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;It comes down to what happens in your body before you poop. “Microbes in our guts prefer to ferment dietary fibers and turn them into organic acids,” Gibbons says. “They’re very good for our health and, if we’re under-exposed to them, we tend to have poorer outcomes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But if poop hangs out in your gut for too long, the microbes will eat any dietary fiber that’s there and then switch to protein fermentation, Gibbons says. “That leads to a bunch of toxic byproducts, and they have all been associated with chronic disease,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Gibbons points out that this study found these toxic byproducts in the system of slower poopers, even if they weren’t classified as being constipated. “We suspect that being exposed to them for longer periods of time could increase your lifetime risk of various chronic diseases,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-is-every-other-day-to-two-bowel-movements-a-day-good-for-you" data-node-id="24" class="body-h2 css-w63prd emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="24.0"&gt;Why is every other day to two bowel movements a day good for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;A lot has to do with the above—pooping every other day to twice a day puts you in a sweet spot of not going too often or too little, Gibbons says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But your pooping schedule tends to be a reflection of other things that are happening in your life, says &lt;a href="https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=125744" target="_blank"

class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Ellen Stein, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Bowel movements are often associated with a few features of a healthy lifestyle—greater amounts of vegetable and fruit intake, more exercise and more baseline daily activity, and good hydration,” she explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Stein says that while your bowel movement frequency isn’t a traditional marker of health “it is becoming more apparent that gut health is critical to overall health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true"

data-node-id="29.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Rudolph Bedford, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, agrees. “It’s all about the gut microbiome,” he says. “It impacts the digestive system, brain health...various aspects of your body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-poop-more" data-node-id="30" class="body-h2 css-w63prd

much as you’d like, doctors recommend trying to do a few different things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Going too little could be a sign that you are missing something—daily exercise, hydration, fiber from healthy plants and fruits,” Dr. Stein says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="when-to-see-a-doctor" data-node-id="34" class="body-h2 css-w63prd emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="34.0"&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Doctors generally recommend that you see your healthcare provider when you have a change in your usual pooping habits. “If your frequency changes, if you have more than three bowel movements each day, if you have urgency or accidents or leakage, those are good reasons to check in with a provider,” Dr. Stein says. And, if you have any blood in your poop, she says that you shouldn’t hesitate to call your doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“If you have less than two bowel movements each week, or there is blood in the stool, weight loss, or you are straining a lot to get the stool out, talk with your physician about changes to your lifestyle and medications, and if you are in need for screening or evaluation for colon cancer,” Dr. Stein says. It’s also important to flag if you have a family history of Celiac disease or irritable bowel issues, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Finally, Dr. Bedford says it’s important to speak up if you’re dealing with uncomfortable symptoms linked to your pooping habits, like bloating, gas, and stomach pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If you’re within the “normal” range of pooping, Gibbons says there’s no need to worry about your bowel habits, unless they suddenly change. But if you find that constipation or diarrhea is a common issue for you, it’s important to get it checked out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention Magazine</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 12:34:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPWTZ4dVU4ZjBQREItb2FZc0VmUEUyMV8weXNMUU00RGxpQVctbkZVNWdjSlozZU1SNVZxLXpiYnNuR2JJNXdwZFFoQVgxbk1GRUJHMGRnWWRRMmFULTRoMllRWHloOHoyLTRGcmlJck5xSF9ZaEVqc0JjRENvZXNLRG9jZk5oQ3pfLVdBcm5vR3VqRm16V1E</guid></item><item><title>Tuberculosis cases continue to increase in San Diego County - The San Diego Union-Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxPSC1KNFZQOUgtN2h6TWVrb1dBYndxX2RtcUE4cXk2cGFlV0Z5Q3RaaU40ZHZPOE5LejVpelo2MVJlVElKZG95NWxnTjFtUVIxdXFVZUV4N1hhbzVkeGs5VTRsWlgxM0tDRmYySXFWUHh5eHlGU1BHWFVvT0F6aWo5Q0c4QW54WW1DTERaM1NFc0NBUnN6UXlnOWYyRkFtR3hLUllXMnNGMGM2U2pj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday was &lt;a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-raises-awareness-ahead-of-world-tuberculosis-day/"&gt;World Tuberculosis Day&lt;/a&gt; and, as usual, Americans had reason to celebrate, with incidence &lt;a href="https://data.who.int/indicators/i/13B4226/C288D13"&gt;rates&lt;/a&gt; that are among the best anywhere, according to the World Health Organization. But that does not mean there is not room for further improvement, especially in San Diego County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-raises-awareness-ahead-of-world-tuberculosis-day/"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; calling for greater tuberculosis awareness, the San Diego County health department indicates that the region had 7.5 tuberculosis cases per 100,000 residents in 2024, a rate that is more than double the national rate of 3 per 100,000 and 5.4 per 100,000 in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the most recent country-by-country data is from 2022, it shows that the average rate across the globe is 134 cases per 100,000 residents with countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mongolia and the Philippines listed as having some of the highest rates globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though local numbers, compared to other commonly tracked infectious diseases such as the flu and coronavirus, are small, TB is nonetheless on a continued rise in San Diego County and in most locations nationwide. San Diego tallied 247 total cases in 2024 compared with 243 in 2023. While it is the fourth consecutive annual increase, local totals have not yet reached the recent high of 264 cases recorded in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As was the case for most infectious diseases, tuberculosis cases fell in 2020, reaching 193 in a year characterized by a wide-ranging stay-at-home order and other transmission-reducing practices put in place in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, while TB numbers have continued to rise since the pandemic, they have not yet fully regained the heights reached in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While case numbers do not yet show a larger problem than existed before the pandemic, the trend is headed in the wrong direction, especially since the county has been engaged in a tuberculosis elimination &lt;a href="https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/tuberculosis_control_program/tbei.html"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; since January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the flu or COVID-19, tuberculosis has a long lead time. The bacteria that causes the disease can live in the human respiratory tract for many years, or even decades, before becoming active, invading the bloodstream and causing deadly illness. About 175,000 people who live in San Diego County are estimated to be carrying “latent” infections, which are in a sort of dormancy and do not spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to winning the tuberculosis fight, then, is detecting and eliminating latent infections before they become active and gain the ability to spread from person to person through tiny water droplets shed through everyday activities such as coughing, speaking or singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jeffrey Percak, medical director and chief of the county’s Tuberculosis Control Program, said that the organization’s main TB clinic and associated health centers screened about 4,000 local residents for TB infection in 2024 with about 800 of those initial tests coming back positive. The number was similar, he said, in 2023, and no data was available on what percentage of those who tested positive took the antibiotics necessary to eliminate latent infections. Those numbers, though, do not include testing and treatment performed by private health care organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work is underway with a wide range of medical providers to better understand treatment rates in order to determine what percentage of those who are screened and found to have an infection make it all the way to a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have started collecting that data so that we’re able to look at it as a proportion of people achieving all of the steps that would be needed to lead to the outcomes that we’re looking for,” Percak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is it that San Diego County has a higher-than-average per-capita level of TB activity? TB rates are known and observed to be higher in places with higher proportions of residents who travel internationally, especially to countries where the disease is much more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A majority are born outside the United States, and that reflects a combination of the likelihood of having been exposed previously in life but also reflects an intersection of social determinants of health like language barriers, health literacy, access to care, education and housing,” Percak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic health conditions such as HIV, diabetes or other immune system problems increase risk as does smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with chronic conditions who were born outside the United States are at the top of the list of people who should get tested. One common misconception, Percak said, is that the cases that pop up each year are among recent immigrants. However, that’s not true. He said that because TB can take so long to become active, cases are most often among those who have been around for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The overwhelming majority of people who are diagnosed with TB who are born outside the United States are not recently arrived,” Percak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are people who are long-standing parts of our community, who have been here for many years or decades before they become sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big part of the fight toward TB elimination is around getting those who do test positive to follow through with antibiotic treatment. In the past, such treatment took many months to complete and involved antibiotics with a significant impact on liver health. However, a new crop of medications significantly reduces those burdens, making the process easier and more comfortable to undergo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those without health insurance can call the county’s TB clinic at 858-573-7300 for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

Early symptoms &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" title="Experts rave eating these five foods dramatically slashes dementia risk" href="/news/health/166815/experts-rave-five-foods-slash-dem" target="_blank"&gt;can include a craving for "sweet, fatty foods or carbohydrates,&lt;/a&gt;" according to Alzheimer's UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other signs may involve becoming easily distracted, struggling with planning or decision-making, and exhibiting repetitive behaviors such as repeating phrases or gestures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, those with frontotemporal dementia are unaware of their symptoms, with close family and friends usually being the first to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the disease progresses and nerve cells in the brain's frontal lobes become increasingly damaged, antisocial behaviour may emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could manifest as making inappropriate comments about someone's appearance, displaying sexual gestures in public, or showing verbal or physical aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to empathize with others may also diminish, leading to a lack of consideration for those around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damage to the brain's temporal lobes can lead to language difficulties, with individuals potentially forgetting the meanings of words and losing their vocabulary. This could even extend to forgetting the purpose of everyday objects, such as a toaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON'T MISS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Along with losing the ability to communicate clearly, they may also eventually lose the skills to use everyday objects such as cutlery, toothbrushes or doors," warns the charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language impairment might also manifest in other ways, like shortening sentences during conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, someone with frontotemporal dementia might say, "I... walking... shop" instead of saying that they are walking to the shop.

					&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The battle against Alzheimer’s disease continues to challenge medical researchers worldwide, but a simple fermented milk drink might offer unexpected benefits for those affected by this devastating condition. New research from Brazil has identified promising cognitive improvements linked to regular consumption of kefir, a tangy probiotic-rich beverage with origins in Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;The growing Alzheimer’s crisis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://rollingout.com/2025/03/19/the-7-stages-of-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; currently affects approximately 7 million Americans, with that number expected to nearly double within the next 25 years. As the most common form of dementia, it progressively destroys memory and cognitive function, leaving patients increasingly dependent on caregivers and loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The condition places enormous emotional and financial strain on families and healthcare systems. With limited pharmaceutical options available and no cure on the horizon, researchers are increasingly exploring alternative approaches to managing symptoms and potentially slowing disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;This search has led scientists to investigate an unexpected ally in cognitive health—the trillions of microorganisms residing in our digestive systems. Growing evidence suggests that these gut microbes may influence brain function through what researchers call the “gut-brain axis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;The gut-brain connection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Recent neuroscience research has revealed a complex communication network between our digestive system and brain. This bidirectional relationship means that the health of our gut microbiome can potentially impact &lt;a href="https://rollingout.com/2025/02/27/dementia-and-its-impact-on-cognitive/"&gt;cognitive&lt;/a&gt; function and neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The microorganisms in our intestinal tract produce various compounds that can enter the bloodstream and potentially cross the blood-brain barrier. Some of these bacterial metabolites have anti-inflammatory properties that might protect against neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Imbalances in gut bacteria have been linked to increased inflammation throughout the body, including the brain. This inflammation may contribute to the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Probiotics—beneficial bacteria found in fermented foods—may help restore a healthy balance of gut microorganisms and reduce this inflammation. Kefir stands out among probiotic foods due to its exceptionally diverse microbial content, containing both beneficial bacteria and yeasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;What makes kefir special?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Kefir is produced by fermenting milk with kefir grains—small, cauliflower-like structures containing a complex community of beneficial microorganisms. Unlike &lt;a href="https://rollingout.com/2025/02/20/why-greek-yogurt-is-taking-over/"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, which typically contains only a few bacterial strains, kefir hosts dozens of different probiotic species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The fermentation process creates a tangy, slightly effervescent beverage with a consistency between milk and yogurt. Beyond its probiotic content, kefir provides protein, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin B12, and other nutrients important for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Traditional kefir originated in the Caucasus Mountains, where locals discovered that adding kefir grains to milk created a beverage that would stay fresh longer. They attributed exceptional longevity in the region partly to regular kefir consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Modern commercial varieties are widely available in supermarkets, though traditional homemade kefir maintains a more diverse microbial profile. The drink has gained popularity worldwide as interest in gut health and fermented foods has increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;The promising research findings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Brazilian scientists conducted a comprehensive review analyzing seven studies on kefir’s effects on Alzheimer’s symptoms. While most involved animal subjects, one notable human trial produced particularly encouraging results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;In this small human study, 13 participants diagnosed with Alzheimer’s consumed kefir daily for 90 days. Researchers administered 2 milliliters of kefir per kilogram of body weight—equivalent to about one cup daily for an average adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The results were remarkable. After the three-month period, participants demonstrated a 28% improvement in overall cognitive functioning as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination, a standard assessment tool for dementia. Even more impressive, memory test scores improved by 66%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;These cognitive improvements corresponded with positive changes in biological markers. Participants showed reduced levels of inflammatory compounds and oxidative stress indicators in their blood, suggesting that kefir might address some of the underlying physiological processes involved in Alzheimer’s progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;Animal studies reinforce the findings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Supporting evidence comes from laboratory research involving rodents and even fruit flies, which are often used as simplified models for studying brain disorders. These animal studies provide insights into the potential mechanisms behind kefir’s beneficial effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="[&amp;amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-decimal space-y-1.5 pl-7"&gt;
&lt;li class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Rodent experiments demonstrated that kefir consumption reduced neuroinflammation—the chronic inflammation in brain tissue that contributes to neuron damage in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Kefir appeared to downregulate the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a cellular pathway involved in triggering inflammatory responses in the brain. Excessive TLR4 activation has been implicated in various neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Studies with fruit flies showed that kefir supplementation reduced the accumulation of amyloid plaques—abnormal protein deposits that characterize Alzheimer’s disease and interfere with neuron communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Both rodent and fruit fly research indicated improvements in motor coordination and physical capabilities following kefir consumption, suggesting benefits beyond cognitive function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Multiple animal studies noted decreases in oxidative stress markers after kefir supplementation. Oxidative stress, which involves damage from unstable molecules called free radicals, is believed to contribute significantly to brain cell deterioration in Alzheimer’s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;Expert perspectives on the findings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Dr. Peter Gliebus, who directs the cognitive and behavioral neurology program at Marcus Neuroscience Institute, finds the biological rationale for kefir’s benefits compelling but emphasizes the preliminary nature of the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;“The concept makes sense from what we understand about the gut-brain axis,” he explains. “Kefir may help restore a balanced gut microbiome and reduce systemic inflammation, which could potentially limit inflammation in the brain tissue. However, we need larger, more rigorous clinical trials before recommending specific probiotics as standard treatment for Alzheimer’s patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Dr. Joel Salinas, a neurologist specializing in brain health, agrees with this cautious approach while acknowledging the promise of dietary interventions like kefir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;“These early studies are encouraging, but still in initial stages,” Salinas notes. “What’s particularly interesting is how these findings align with growing evidence supporting the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet, which incorporates fermented foods among other brain-healthy components.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Both experts emphasize that managing Alzheimer’s requires a comprehensive approach. While dietary factors like kefir consumption may play a supportive role, they should complement established interventions such as regular physical exercise, cognitive stimulation, social engagement, and medical management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;Practical considerations for kefir consumption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;For those interested in adding kefir to their diet, several considerations may help maximize potential benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Traditional kefir typically contains a more diverse microbial population than commercial varieties, though both contain beneficial probiotics. Those making kefir at home should follow proper food safety practices to avoid contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Commercial kefir products vary significantly in sugar content. Choosing plain, unsweetened versions and adding fresh fruit for flavor provides probiotics without excessive added sugars, which some research suggests may contribute to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Individuals with lactose intolerance often tolerate kefir better than other dairy products because the fermentation process breaks down much of the lactose. However, completely lactose-free and non-dairy alternatives made from coconut water or plant milks are also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The optimal dosage remains unclear based on current research. The human study mentioned earlier used approximately one cup daily for an average adult, but future research may refine these recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;As with any dietary supplement, individuals taking medications or with existing health conditions should consult healthcare providers before making significant changes to their diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;The future of kefir research for Alzheimer’s&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;While current findings offer reason for optimism, researchers emphasize that larger clinical trials with more participants and longer duration are essential next steps. Future studies will need to address several important questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;What specific kefir components or microbial strains provide the most significant cognitive benefits? Different kefir varieties contain varying bacterial and yeast populations that may influence effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;At what stage of Alzheimer’s development might kefir consumption be most beneficial? Early intervention could potentially yield greater results than beginning supplementation after significant cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;How does kefir compare or interact with established Alzheimer’s medications? Understanding these relationships could help optimize treatment protocols that combine dietary approaches with pharmaceutical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Are certain populations more likely to benefit from kefir consumption based on genetic factors, existing gut microbiome composition, or other variables? Personalized approaches might eventually enhance effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;What is the optimal dosage and duration for maximum cognitive benefits? The amount used in the initial human study provides a starting point, but refinement through additional research could improve outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-200 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;A cautiously optimistic outlook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;While kefir shows genuine promise as a complementary approach to Alzheimer’s management, medical experts advise maintaining realistic expectations. No single intervention—dietary, pharmaceutical, or otherwise—is likely to provide a complete solution for this complex neurological condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The most encouraging aspect of this research may be how it highlights the potential benefits of readily available, natural foods in supporting brain health. Unlike experimental drugs that may take decades to develop and approve, fermented foods like kefir are already accessible to most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;For individuals concerned about brain health or those with family histories of dementia, incorporating fermented foods into a balanced diet represents a low-risk strategy that aligns with general wellness recommendations. Beyond potential cognitive benefits, these foods support overall digestive health and immune function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;As research into the gut-brain connection continues to evolve, kefir and similar &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-get-more-probiotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;probiotic-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; may become increasingly important components of both preventative strategies and complementary treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. While not a miracle cure, this ancient fermented beverage offers a promising avenue for further exploration in our quest to combat dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

And it tracks with women in general being much more likely than men to have autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women tend to mount strong immune responses to vaccines and viruses, and those sorts of differences in initial immune response may then result in someone developing a chronic illness, compared to clearing the virus and recovering from it,” said Akiko Iwasaki, a Yale immunologist and leading long COVID researcher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With long COVID specifically, scientists are still trying to uncover why women are affected more often than men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t really know why, but there are several hypotheses about why women might be more susceptible,” Iwasaki said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sex hormones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some emerging evidence suggests sex hormones — including estrogen, progesterone and testosterone — may play a role in long COVID risk, though it’s not clear exactly how or why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recent &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829454" data-link="native" class=""&gt;study in JAMA&lt;/a&gt; found that women overall are 31% more likely to develop long COVID than men. It also found notable differences in long COVID risk among women, depending on age and menopausal status.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women ages 40 to 54 who are not menopausal are at highest risk — they are 45% more likely to get long COVID than men of the same age group, according to the study, the NIH-funded RECOVER study that includes one of the largest data sets on people with long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, women 40 to 54 who are menopausal are not significantly more likely to get long COVID than men of the same age group. Women 18 to 39 are also not significantly more likely to get long COVID compared to their male counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that changes that occur in menopause — including a decline in estrogen and changes in the immune system — may affect long COVID risk, said Dr. Dimpy Shah, an assistant professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and lead author of the JAMA study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After menopause hits, the risk becomes almost similar between males and females,” Shah said. “That means females are no longer at (higher) risk once they hit menopause.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who are menopausal have lower estrogen levels than women who are not yet menopausal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think estrogen plays a role for high risk of long COVID,” Shah said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it may be that changes that occur during pregnancy — most pregnant women in the study were in the 18-to-39 group — such as higher progesterone levels, or the body’s response to antigens, may put pregnant women at lower risk for long COVID than non-pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s an interplay of all these things that affect risk of long COVID over various stages of life in females,” Shah said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 p1h5oaun mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yale immunologist Akiko Iwasaki is a leading long COVID researcher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yale University/AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate from the JAMA study, Iwasaki said the most striking finding on sex differences in long COVID is that lower levels of testosterone is the top predictor of whether women have long COVID; women with long COVID have lower levels of the hormone than women without long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And lower levels of estradiol, a type of estrogen, is the top predictor of whether men have long COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These dysfunctional sex hormones we find in many patients may also be at play,” Iwasaki said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Genetic factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been theorized that women, who have two X chromosomes, may be more prone to autoimmune disorders than men, who have one X and one Y chromosome, in part because many genes related to immunity are on the X chromosome. These include genes that regulate how T-cells respond to antibodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women with long COVID appear to have elevated levels of exhausted T-cells, which accumulate when someone cannot clear an infection, Iwasaki said. This also occurs in cancer patients and people with chronic infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men with long COVID, on the other hand, appear to have higher levels of natural killer cells, a type of white blood cell that destroys infected cells. That suggests different cells are being engaged in women versus men with long COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39536117/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found that women who go on to develop long COVID appear to have an increased expression of the RNA gene Xist during their acute COVID infection stage compared to women who don’t get long COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xist gene is believed to be related to autoimmunity, and previous research has shown that an increased expression of Xist is linked to autoimmune diseases that are more common in women than in men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Linda Geng is co-director of the Stanford Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Courtesy Stanford Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other studies have also implicated autoimmune pathways in long COVID and, given the higher rates of autoimmunity in females, this may be one explanation for why females have higher rates of long COVID, though it may not be the sole explanation,” said Dr. Linda Geng, co-director of the Stanford Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Different symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see distinct symptoms are more prevalent in females compared to males,” Iwasaki said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main one is that women with long COVID are more likely to have hair loss, she said. Headache, taste issues, memory issues and bloating are also more prevalent in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men with long COVID are more likely to report sexual dysfunction, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, women are more likely to seek medical care for long COVID, said Dr. Nisha Viswanathan, director of UCLA Health’s Long Covid Program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In all (age) groups, I see more female patients,” said Viswanathan, who estimates that the ratio of female to male long COVID patients is about 3 to 1.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viswanathan said many female patients experience more intense long COVID, such as fatigue or brain fog, during their menstrual cycle or during ovulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the differences are important&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long COVID is not the only infectious disease where scientists have seen sex differences. Previous studies, for instance, have found that women are able to clear some malaria infections and initial COVID infections faster than men, said Dr. Prasanna Jagannathan, an associate professor of medicine at Stanford who specializes in infectious diseases and immunology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why that is is not entirely understood,” Jagannathan said. “There is a big research gap, generally, in trying to understand why responses to infectious diseases could have these sex biases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s not entirely clear why women get long COVID more often, it’s important for women and health care providers to be aware that women are at higher risk, Shah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If women are experiencing lingering symptoms, it’s important not to ignore those symptoms and talk to their medical provider because they may have long COVID, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We feel half the population being at higher risk for long COVID has health policy implications as well,” Shah said. “We should be mindful to consider this is a higher risk group. This is just a starting point. We need to do so much more research with regard to what’s driving this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p class="cci_endnote_contact" title="CCI End Note Contact"&gt;Reach Catherine Ho: cho@sfchronicle.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 11:00:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxPdU51M0FLaFp5LUtmYlZSNFZwUkN6eFY4S3Y3dTdYUk5nZS1sRkE2cVBHNS1ZRURYQURkNV9ESnl4YTBja0k0Q2huMFlFZ01JQXV6NDNOZ2lXTExiRF9wMnF1UW1UU192dUE3RUotYmV4T1lRdTgyTkk2X0lMLWh3bHljR1J6UQ</guid></item><item><title>Bethenny Frankel, 54, Swears By This Daily Walking Routine—Here's Why - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE9Hc3FGV1NZSkNfbm9jNW5ocXBDRWNYcjRhVXE5LUJQM3paY2pOdWhDdkhhaTJBRVY3UlNDbUUyMEVKLWxLbEZfYXJCdWRlOG9JMmZ1MTB6WDBUaVR0WWgxWXVFNVVEbjBxNmg4dU5KSUJ0QUdtZ1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;How Bethenny Frankel Stays Healthy At 54&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Astrida Valigorsky - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you first met bold, brash Bethenny Frankel all the way back in 2008 during the first season of Bravo’s &lt;em&gt;The Real Housewives of New York City&lt;/em&gt; (seriously, what is time!?!) or have become a more recent fan thanks to her informational and often-irreverent &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40bethennyfrankel&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64275987%2Fbethenny-frankel-workout-diet-age%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikToks;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;TikToks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you know at least a couple of things about the Skinnygirl founder. First off, she has opinions. Secondly, she is not afraid to share them. To that end, Bethenny recently launched &lt;a href="https://bethenny.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The List;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The List&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where all of her favorite finds and candid thoughts live in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 54 years old, Bethenny continues to be as lively and vital as ever—which got us wondering about what her health and wellness list might look like too. From magnesium foot sprays to digestive water boosters, Bethenny shared with &lt;em&gt;WH&lt;/em&gt; her top five tips and tricks for staying happy and healthy in her 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. She doesn't cut corners when it comes to sleep hygiene.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a stressful period of life left Bethenny chasing Zs—at one point she was only getting about five hours a night—she got serious about sleep hygiene. “Sleep is a big character in my life, and the effort that I make to get sleep and the different things that I do to get sleep are militant,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s not kidding: Her night time routine truly is a head-to-toe affair. Bethenny starts with an eye mask to block out any potential sunlight that might seep through the curtains or blinds, which is “critical,” she says. To stop her teeth from grinding, she started wearing a night guard in her 40s, and she recently added mouth tape to the equation, which she says has helped further ease her jaw muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around her neck she wraps a scented pillow fresh out of a warming cabinet (think: that magical device from which a masseuse or manicurist pulls a hot towel) in order to help herself relax. She might pop a gummy or two (she’s sent a ton of samples so she dabbles—be it melatonin or cannabis-infused), and, to finish, she spritzes the soles of her feet with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a26947301/magnesium-for-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;magnesium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; spray. Bethenny attributes this full routine to helping increase her sleep duration to around eight hours a night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. She aims for 10,000 steps per day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bethenny adheres to a pretty no-frills workout routine: walking. Okay, sure, she might hop into the occasional yoga class from time to time (she also tried weights once—it didn’t stick, she says). But Bethenny says that walking is really the only consistent form of movement she prioritizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She aims for 10,000 steps a day—usually outside in nature—and says that she generally sleeps better if she hits that mark.

That's because she’s mostly stopped drinking over the past few months. Without alcohol, Bethenny says, she’s able to balance her emotional levels better. “It’s how you're reacting to something, how you're dealing with something, how irritable you are,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. She supercharges her water.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with reducing her alcohol intake, Bethenny makes sure she stays hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Bethenny suffers from &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61816919/katie-ledecky-pots/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:POTS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;POTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome—a condition in which the heart rate rises rapidly after sitting or lying down. It can cause light-headedness and faintness upon standing. Severe dehydration is another of Bethenny’s symptoms.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Plant-Based Electrolyte Drink Mix&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRRRKDK5?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64275987%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$23.99 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$23.99 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she isn’t chugging plain H2O to avoid dehydration issues—her water often pulls double-duty. “I put hydration packets in my water,” she says. “There are several different types of water flavor stories that I have going on—some are relaxing, some are hydrating, some are digestive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://membership.womenshealthmag.com/womens-health-premium-membership-single.html?cds_tracking_code=whl_edit_inline_bethenny_frankel_workout_diet_age_a64275987" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sign up for WH+;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sign up for WH+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for exclusive fitness and nutrition programs created exclusively for subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like the gummies, she’s willing to try a little bit of this, a little bit of that.

She focuses on moderation, not perfection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Bethenny's approach to health and wellness boils down to the principle of balance. In her diet, that means eating the fruits she loves, like pineapple and watermelon, plus also allowing herself a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHJImMygnac/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chewy orange slice candy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chewy orange slice candy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that brings her back to her childhood. Or, while she’s embarking on her sober curious journey, sipping the occasional cocktail while out at a celebratory dinner with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe in balance, and I've taught that to my daughter too,” Bethenny says. “I'm not educated on every single thing. I barely know what &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63620912/are-seed-oils-bad/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seed oils;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;seed oils&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are.

So it’s appearing to be that it might be a hot spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crusan says it’s the first detection in livestock since last summer and was discovered during mandatory raw milk surveillance testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low and behold, that testing resulted in a positive detection in Stearns County. So, we do have H5N1 in a dairy herd in Minnesota. I’ll say it’s back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crusan says the same farm was affected last summer and is one of only a handful of dairies in the state to test positive for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctor &lt;strong&gt;Brian Hoefs&lt;/strong&gt; is executive director of the&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bah.state.mn.us/h5n1" target="_blank"&gt; Minnesota Board of Animal Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;to determine if this active infection or if it potentially is an infection that is waxing and waning and on its way out. So additional testing would be weekly testing on that farm until we get consecutive weeks of negative tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoefs says bird flu is always fatal in poultry but is considered more of a "nuisance" disease in the cattle industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that pasteurization milk is effective in deactivating the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;READ RELATED ARTICLES&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;Tour Waite Park -- Past and Present -- in Pictures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WJON News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:07:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYEFVX3lxTFBrOEN2V19vQm9rcU1kNV9ZZ0VfNDc4Ml9HV0dVUUtETmF3bFotQ1ZVS2JZcGNPUGgtVGRvQjRuVmZKMXVGRXFBTmpqbjF4dXdiekZKVF9xUnlNVFdMX19DaA</guid></item><item><title>In fascinating study, neuroscientists reveal the unique impact of nostalgic music on the brain - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxNV3ZZSWswV29jNE1aUzdVQnk2UUsxS19NU2dkaEh2a2dwMFhRUmE2UnRSVlBHdFJyc015ZTctSWtYRldqQzU3NWZ1OXpxdlR3bllkNWNpN2tiNzBuZ0JULW44b3lPOU52b3ZLNnFjNEFrMXVxMlFUa2s2NTVYMXNRMkpXZ0tJWVNMNlRxUjhRcTdIbHBzTkVhMWZoeEdXYVR2TjdsS1hYTWQ2QmtBRjF3TjVmcHBEUFRqOWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;Human Brain Mapping&lt;/em&gt; has found that music which evokes nostalgia activates a unique network of brain regions tied to memory, self-reflection, and emotion. Researchers discovered that self-selected nostalgic songs triggered more brain activity than familiar or unfamiliar non-nostalgic music in both younger and older adults. Notably, older adults showed even stronger activation in key nostalgia-related areas, suggesting nostalgic music may play a special role in memory and emotional processing later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was driven by growing interest in how music can help people with memory loss, especially those with Alzheimer’s disease or related conditions. While it’s well known that music can stir strong emotions and bring back personal memories, scientists have only recently started to explore the brain’s response to nostalgic music in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of the new study was to understand how nostalgia-evoking music differs from other types of music in the brain, and how these effects might vary across the lifespan. This foundational knowledge could eventually inform new therapies using music to help preserve memory and emotional well-being in aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I grew up as an avid musician and music listener. As a teenager, I began to notice how certain songs could transport me back to moment in time, where I could truly feel how I&lt;br&gt; felt in that moment or era of my life and return to that headspace,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.sarahlouisehennessy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Sarah Hennessy&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral research scientist at the University of Arizona, who conducted the study while a PhD student at the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d be listening to the Beatles White Album and I’d be back in the car with my dad, driving to school for fourth grade through the snow and sipping a hot chocolate. I began collecting these types of songs and ‘saving them for a rainy day,’ in a way, where I listened to them when I felt lonely, or simply needed to reminisce.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Later, various anecdotal reports began to emerge that individuals with Alzheimer’s and other dementias could still emotionally respond to personalized music, even with profound memory degradation, which I was very interested in. Unsurprisingly, this fascination continued into my research career! So my primary motivation for this project was to understand why and how we feel nostalgia associated with music, and how this manifests in the brain across adulthood, which will help us understand these processes in individuals with cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers recruited 57 healthy participants—29 younger adults aged 18 to 35, and 28 older adults aged 60 and above. Each participant identified six songs that personally evoked nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nostalgic music is not universal,” Hennessy noted. “Every individual has a different personalized set of nostalgic songs that have meaning and memories attached to them. These songs span across every genre.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then used a machine-learning tool to find other songs that were musically similar in tempo, key, and energy, but did not evoke nostalgia. These were used as “familiar control” songs. Additionally, the team selected unfamiliar songs that were also musically matched, ensuring that differences in brain activity could be attributed to nostalgia rather than musical features or familiarity alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the main experiment, participants listened to their nostalgia-evoking songs, as well as the matched familiar and unfamiliar control songs, while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. Each song was played for 40 seconds, and participants kept their eyes closed to focus on the music and any thoughts or feelings it evoked. Afterward, they completed tasks assessing memory and rated how nostalgic, positive, or emotionally intense the songs felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain scans revealed that nostalgic songs, more than the control songs, activated a wide array of brain regions. These included areas involved in self-reflection and memory (such as the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus), emotional salience (like the insula and anterior cingulate cortex), and reward processing (including the ventral tegmental area and orbitofrontal cortex). These regions together form a network associated with processing autobiographical memories, regulating emotions, and feeling pleasure—all key elements of the nostalgic experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the nostalgic songs also triggered increased functional connectivity between brain regions involved in self-related processing and emotional awareness. Specifically, the posterior medial cortex showed stronger communication with the anterior insula when participants listened to nostalgic music, suggesting that nostalgia may integrate personal memories with emotional significance in a particularly powerful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite all of the differences present in musical choice, nostalgia as evoked by music is associated with a very clear pattern in the brain across individuals and across the lifespan,” Hennessy told PsyPost. “This pattern involves parts of the brain called the default mode network and the reward network. These networks of the brain help us process information about our own life stories, and respond to things that bring us pleasure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults not only reported feeling more positive emotions while listening to music in general, but they also showed stronger brain responses to nostalgic songs than younger adults. In particular, older participants showed greater activation in brain areas related to sound, memory, and emotional meaning, such as the temporal pole, angular gyrus, and sensory processing regions. The findings suggest that older adults may engage more deeply with nostalgic music, possibly reflecting a shift in emotional priorities with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We observed that older adults actually had slightly stronger activation in these nostalgia-related regions than younger adults,” Hennessy explained. “We expected older and younger adults to have similar patterns of activation, but this finding was a bit unexpected. There are a few different explanations for this finding, but future work is needed to really parse them apart. But for now, it’s an interesting piece of information to explore in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study, like all research, includes some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our sample was from the greater Los Angeles area, so of course is not representative of all younger and older adults,” Hennessy noted. “I think there is a lot of cool work to be done exploring the role of culture in music-evoked nostalgia and autobiographical memory. Participants only listed to 40 second clips in the scanner (we hope to explore these research questions with full-length pieces in the future). However, the fact that we saw such robust effects with only 40 seconds is pretty amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, this research represents a significant step toward understanding the neuroscience of nostalgia and how music taps into deep emotional and autobiographical experiences. The study’s authors hope to apply these insights to future work with clinical populations, including individuals with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal is to use this research to create, improve, and understand music-based interventions for neurodegenerative diseases,” Hennessy explained. “If we can understand how music-evoked memories and emotions can remain in individuals with dementia, we can learn how to harness music to improve quality of life for these individuals and their caregivers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.70181" target="_blank"&gt;Music-Evoked Nostalgia Activates Default Mode and Reward Networks Across the Lifespan&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sarah Hennessy, Petr Janata, Talia Ginsberg, Jonas Kaplan, and Assal Habibi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:02:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNV3ZZSWswV29jNE1aUzdVQnk2UUsxS19NU2dkaEh2a2dwMFhRUmE2UnRSVlBHdFJyc015ZTctSWtYRldqQzU3NWZ1OXpxdlR3bllkNWNpN2tiNzBuZ0JULW44b3lPOU52b3ZLNnFjNEFrMXVxMlFUa2s2NTVYMXNRMkpXZ0tJWVNMNlRxUjhRcTdIbHBzTkVhMWZoeEdXYVR2TjdsS1hYTWQ2QmtBRjF3TjVmcHBEUFRqOWc</guid></item><item><title>What regularly going to sleep after midnight says about your health - Yahoo Life</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxQQW5BeUpUWC1VRDhQdEdLOVZZR0VVd1BndlEtZUpaYUNKNXpqQ3N2cUFxZWRMZHZnbFFySzl1RHl6MElUOUI3emlmRFZBdHR0Y0VQajl6eGFBNDVxS1VtcklxOTlEd0VtVmZkRklmQWYtcElSc0FCT25XRDB2bGh0MlROcjBlYVVaNTdyNm85MlB3alJNMUs2WDVSQmVXalBNUDg4R1Vrc1oybXNubWF4dWhRS3M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There’s no universal rule that says you have to go to bed at a certain time when you’re an adult, but you’ve likely heard the common refrain that it’s best to fall asleep before midnight.

(In case you’re not familiar with it, glycemic variability is how much blood glucose levels go up and down. In a perfect world, they’re stable.) The study’s authors pointed out that glycemic variability is a risk factor for chronic disease and early death, which makes it reasonable to wonder if going to bed after midnight puts you at risk for those bad outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Falling asleep past midnight can also affect your mental health. A 2024 study published in the journal &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165178124002415" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Psychiatric Research;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Psychiatric Research&lt;/a&gt; found that people who go to bed after 1 a.m. were at a higher risk of having depression and generalized anxiety disorder, regardless of whether they identified as being a morning person or night owl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07420528.2018.1454458" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:older research;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;older research&lt;/a&gt; also links going to bed late and struggling to wake up in the morning to having a shorter lifespan, along with a higher risk of health complications like diabetes and psychological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-happens-to-your-body-if-you-go-to-sleep-after-midnight"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens to your body if you go to sleep after midnight?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It depends. If you regularly go to sleep after midnight, but you also don’t have to be anywhere until later the next morning, your bedtime is unlikely to be an issue, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jadewuphd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jade Wu,;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Jade Wu,&lt;/a&gt; a behavioral sleep medicine specialist and author of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/hello-sleep-the-science-and-art-of-overcoming-insomnia-without-medications-jade-wu/18738942?ean=9781250347428&amp;amp;next=t" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hello Sleep: The Science and Art of Overcoming Insomnia Without Medications;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello Sleep: The Science and Art of Overcoming Insomnia Without Medications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tells Yahoo Life. “There is nothing magical about midnight,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But Wu says that going to bed after midnight depends on a number of factors, including your chronotype (i.e., your biologically hardwired body clock), when you get up in the morning, how much sleep you need, what you do during the day and evening and how consistent your sleep timing is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Wu also recommends keeping this in mind when it comes to midnight bedtimes: “When a research study shows harmful associations with going to bed after midnight, it's not because midnight is a special time, but because when you do a research study and ask people about their sleep habits, you have to categorize their answers somehow,” she says. “If, on average, people are healthier and happier when they consistently go to bed before midnight, it's likely because people, on average, need to get up early enough for work/family that routinely going to bed after midnight means they routinely don't get enough sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That said, going to bed after midnight often suggests that you may be less likely to be getting enough sleep, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.vumc.org/neurology/person/beth-ann-malow-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Beth Malow;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Beth Malow&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Vanderbilt Sleep Division at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, tells Yahoo Life. It also means you may be messing with your circadian rhythm, which is your body’s natural 24-hour cycle, she adds. Your circadian rhythm helps regulate multiple physiological and behavioral processes in your body, including signaling to your body that it’s time to wake up or wind down for bed, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Our natural circadian rhythms usually have us going to bed earlier, before midnight,” Malow says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Going to bed past midnight here and there can mess with your health too. Falling asleep after 12 a.m. if you typically go to bed around 10 p.m. may mean that you don’t get as much deep sleep as you need, Winter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Deep sleep happens predominantly in that first one to two hours. So, for the average sleeper, that’s probably 10 p.m. to 12 a.m.,” he explains. “Going to bed after midnight means missing out on the bulk of deep sleep/slow wave sleep.” This phase of sleep is when growth hormone and other chemicals are secreted — missing out can inhibit those and increase levels of the stress hormone cortisol, according to Winter. “Both negatively affect blood sugar and mood,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-to-move-up-your-bedtime"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to move up your bedtime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you consistently go to bed at midnight or even later, but you don’t have to be up early the next morning, your standard bedtime may not be an issue. But if you feel like you have trouble going to bed before midnight and you have to be somewhere in the morning, sleep specialists say there are a few things you can do to try to move up your bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a big dose of bright light in the morning.&lt;/strong&gt; Wu recommends going outside for 20 minutes or so, if you can fit it into your morning. This helps signal to your body that it’s time to wake up and helps to keep your circadian rhythm in line with the daylight. If that’s not doable, Winter suggests eating breakfast or getting ready next to a window to expose yourself to natural light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t nap during the day.&lt;/strong&gt; This can be difficult to achieve if your sleep wasn’t great the night before. But Winter points out that naps can throw your sleep schedule out of whack and push your bedtime back even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider wearing blue light glasses before bed.&lt;/strong&gt; Screens emit blue light, which can&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9424753/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interfere with your circadian rhythm;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt; interfere with your circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt; and your ability to wind down before bed. That’s why doctors usually recommend staying off screens before bed. Unfortunately, that’s not possible for everyone, and for that reason, Wu suggests wearing blue-light-blocking sunglasses for several hours before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work out regularly.&lt;/strong&gt; Having an exercise routine in place can help support good sleep, Malow says. She recommends maximizing physical activity during the day so that you’re ready to crash when bedtime rolls around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you feel as though you've tried everything and still your sleep isn’t as healthy as it should be, it’s worth consulting a health care professional to help determine what might be going on. But, if you regularly go to bed at midnight and wake up feeling refreshed, more power to you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:00:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxQQW5BeUpUWC1VRDhQdEdLOVZZR0VVd1BndlEtZUpaYUNKNXpqQ3N2cUFxZWRMZHZnbFFySzl1RHl6MElUOUI3emlmRFZBdHR0Y0VQajl6eGFBNDVxS1VtcklxOTlEd0VtVmZkRklmQWYtcElSc0FCT25XRDB2bGh0MlROcjBlYVVaNTdyNm85MlB3alJNMUs2WDVSQmVXalBNUDg4R1Vrc1oybXNubWF4dWhRS3M</guid></item><item><title>What makes humans intelligent?

								&lt;input type="hidden" id="article_url" value="2025/03/25/what-makes-humans-intelligent-these-unique-neurons-might-hold-the-key/"&gt;
																	
																
								&lt;p&gt;You probably have a general understanding of the &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/04/04/the-average-human-brain-size-is-growing--but-that-doesnt-exactly-mean-were-smarter/" target="_blank"&gt;human brain&lt;/a&gt;: a network of nerve cells connected by synapses. Complex or abstract ideas emerge as a result of the firing of many of these nerve cells, or neurons. This means that a concept or memory or idea is the result of a distributed pattern of neural activity. In contrast to computer memory, which always follows the same pattern of 1s and 0s, it's more like networks in our brain weave a new tapestry every time we think about something. This understanding is common to most of us lay people who know a little about neurology and the brain, or who are interested in AI and the attempts to replicate human intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you may be badly out of date. As it turns out, in human brains, we also have a specialized type of cell called a concept neuron, which does what was long thought to be impossible: each of these cells encodes entire concepts, so that that single neuron fires whenever you’re exposed to a stimulus relating to that concept, or even when you think about it without an external stimulus. This would be like having a single neuron that fires when you see a photograph of your grandmother, hear her voice, read her name or perhaps even smell her familiar perfume. This single neuron thus has semantic invariance for the concept of your grandmother. This means that it fires whenever your grandmother is the topic of thought, regardless of the context or medium or the sense that stimulates your thought of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Florian Mormann, a physician and researcher who heads a working group on cognitive and clinical neurophysiology at the University of Bonn, told Salon in a video interview that “textbooks of neuroscience that still exist today often mention the grandmother neuron as an example of something you would never find in a brain. Because clearly, it would be so much more efficient to simply have a network of eight neurons if it can do the same job as 70 different neurons. So it seemed a no-brainer for everyone that there shouldn’t be grandmother neurons in any brain”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, the no-brainer is seemingly wrong about the brain. As it turns out, grandmother neurons, or concept cells as they’re now known (or Jennifer Aniston neurons as they were called for a bit, as we’ll see) have been right there in our brains all along. And some scientists have known they are there, gradually learning more about them and their implications, over the past 20 years. It’s not a conspiracy: the news just hasn’t really trickled out to the rest of us. That’s partly because most scientists who physically get right inside skulls to study the brains inside them do so with the brains of non-human animals, so most brain research we hear about still doesn’t involve these neurons, which it seems exist exclusively in the human brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://friedcnl.ucla.edu/team_members/rodrigo-quian-quiroga-phd/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Rodrigo Quian Quiroga&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Centre for Systems Neuroscience at the University of Leicester, discovered concept cells twenty years ago. In research published in January, a team led by Quian Quiroga &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(24)01569-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124724015699%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;showed for the first time the way they respond to a given concept&lt;/a&gt; regardless of the context. This is in contrast to everything that is known about how memories are encoded in non-human animals, and it suggests that this might be a key adaptation behind human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not ethical to carry out invasive procedures on human brains. For this reason, we don’t often conduct single neuron recordings, a type of research that requires access right inside the skull, on humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So in the past 50 years [single neuron recordings have] been done on a huge scale in especially rodents and also in monkeys, plus a few other mammals. But it’s mainly those two species,” Mormann, who, like Quian Quiroga, is one of very few researchers to conduct single neuron studies on humans, told Salon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual neurons could be extremely selective, with a single neuron firing predictably in response to images of a single animal, individual or place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And of course, the multi-million dollar industry of rodent research does not exist because we’re all so fascinated by what the rodent brain can do. Not at all. It is because we believe it could serve as a valid model of the human brain for human episodic memory,” Mormann added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, neuroscience has relied on the data gathered from doing such procedures on mouse and primate models. The assumption that underlies this is that a mouse or monkey brain serves as an adequate, if simplified, proxy for the human. And indeed, that’s been good enough to fuel decades of brain science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single neuron recordings in humans &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single neuron recordings are otherwise only done in rodent or primate models because brain surgery is never without risks, and those are not risks we usually ask humans to take without extremely good reason. A diagnostic procedure to ensure the surgeons don’t resect the wrong hippocampus when considering surgery for patients with epilepsy is something most of us would consider an extremely good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Mormann’s team, and a small number of other research groups, study the firing of individual neurons by inserting fine microwires inside the hollow tube of the depth electrodes that have to be implanted anyway in order to diagnose the location of a patient's seizures in hopes of curing their epilepsy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two decades ago, shortly after single neuron recordings started to be used by scientists to take advantage of this rare opportunity to engage in ethical neurological research in human beings, Dr. Rodrigo Quian Quiroga, who now heads up the Neural Mechanisms of Perception and Memory Research Group at the Hospital del Mar Research Institute in Barcelona, showed that individual neurons could be extremely selective, with a single neuron firing predictably in response to images of a single animal, individual or place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Twenty years ago … I was doing experiments with a patient, and then I showed many pictures of Jennifer Aniston, and I found a neuron that responded only to her and to nothing else,” Quian Quiroga told Salon in a video interview. "And as I found this one, I found many others later on, and basically it was very clear that in an area called the hippocampus that is known to be critical for memory, we have neurons that represent, in this case, specific people, or in general, specific concepts. It can be a person, it can be an object, it can be a place — whatever is relevant to the person or to the patient."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that first work, described in 2005, UCLA neurosurgeon Itzhak Fried, Quian Quiroga, then his mentee, and other colleagues &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03687" target="_blank"&gt;showed that a subset of neurons&lt;/a&gt; in the hippocampal formation, and more generally, in an area of the brain called the medial temporal lobe (MTL) that includes the hippocampus, fire in response to the subjects being shown pictures of a particular person under strikingly different conditions: at different ages, poses or contexts. A given neuron would even fire in response to reading the person’s name. Confusion is possible: for example, a Jennifer Aniston neuron might fire if you show the subject a picture of Lisa Kudrow, who played Phoebe on "Friends" alongside Aniston’s Rachel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nobody expected that this neuron type could exist but we show very clearly that they do exist,” Quian Quiroga said. They dubbed these brain cells Jennifer Aniston neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you call them, these neurons have not yet been found in rats, nor in monkeys, nor in any other mammal or organism — only in humans, despite Quian Quiroga challenging anyone, anywhere to find another creature with concept cells. But in the last two decades, no one has found them in anyone but humans, where they are reliably easy to find by testing neurons at random in the MTL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A brief history of concept cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quian Quiroga’s team and others, like Mormann’s, conducted further studies that gradually revealed different properties of concept neurons in the MTL, primarily in the hippocampus, and how they behave in different conditions. Semantic concept neurons have also been found in different parts of the MTL, such as the amygdala and the entorhinal cortex. Recently, Mormann and his team identified smell-specific &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/02/15/smell-and-sight-are-closer-friends-than-we-realized/"&gt;concept cells in the piriform cortex, which they dubbed olfactory concept cells&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, of 1,856 neurons tested in the piriform cortex in that study, 66 responded to both images and odors, meaning that they had semantic invariance with respect to the concept of the odor in question, firing in response to an image associated with the smell as well as the smell itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts encoded by concept neurons can be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3505687/"&gt;an animal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6564037/"&gt;an article of clothing&lt;/a&gt;, a place, or a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19631538/"&gt;person&lt;/a&gt;. The concept can be evoked, and the associated neuron made to fire, by a direct stimulus such as seeing the person or hearing their voice; or without a stimulus, by &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11099042/"&gt;imagery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2650423/"&gt;free recall&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8545952/"&gt;comparisons&lt;/a&gt; that reference the concept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We show explicitly that [concept cells are] involved in forming and storing memories,” Quian Quiroga explained. “We had a series of experiments [where] we showed that these neurons are involved in the forming of memories, and they can do this very quickly. I mean, in just one shot, they can change the way they respond, and with this, they are encoding new experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further argued that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn3251"&gt;concept cells were fundamental components&lt;/a&gt;, or building blocks, of declarative memory. It’s not surprising, he felt, that we have neurons responding to concepts in an area of the brain associated with memory — after all, we do tend to remember concepts and forget details. The human way of remembering is very abstract. Most of us don’t remember precisely what a person looks like, what they are wearing, or the words they say in a conversation; rather, we focus more on the basic ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the authors (including Mormann) of a 2020 study of &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000290"&gt;how single neurons in the MTL are able to code abstract meaning&lt;/a&gt; write, “Although semantic abstraction is efficient and may facilitate generalization of knowledge to novel situations, it comes at the cost of a loss of detail and may be central to the generation of false memories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, that cost may well be the price of human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I started arguing,” Quian Quiroga recalled, “that this is a trait of human intelligence, and … one of the key aspects that distinguishes us from other animals: the fact that we just don’t focus on details, but we’re able to extract what is the important information and focus on that. And this is the way we store our memories, and this is the way we think so we are not bombarded with details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For humans, unlike our fellow animals, we just want the key point, the essential abstraction. That, Quian Quiroga maintains, is the way we remember, and the way we think. And that’s what he shows with the new study, published in Cell Reports. The research team recorded the activity of individual neurons while patients learned and then recalled two stories that described different situations but featured the same character or place. Nearly all of the neurons that fired initially did so without regard to the context, such that, as the authors explain, “taking all neurons together it is possible to decode the person/place being depicted in each story, but not the particular story.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain cells that fire during learning and memory are firing in response to the concept of that character and will fire in any context in which that concept features. Quian Quiroga believes that the development of language involved adaptation of neurons, common to all mammals, to this specialized purpose. Still, we don't know exactly when this arose, but perhaps it evolved gradually, Quian Quiroga theorized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think in the last 100,000 years, the moment that &lt;em&gt;[Homo] sapiens&lt;/em&gt; started uttering words and attributing meaning to things in terms of words,” Quian Quiroga said. "Then the &lt;em&gt;sapiens&lt;/em&gt; started thinking in terms of words instead of pictures. I think that created the big phase transition of intelligence, the fact that we started thinking in terms of words. I think this created concept cells, because once you attribute the word into something then you get completely rid of the details. And that’s exactly what concept cells do."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new frontier in neuroscience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The striking thing that also since 2005 has gone largely ignored [by] rodent electrophysiologists is that this degree of semantic invariance, plus also context independence, is something we observe only in the human. There’s no other species in the animal kingdom where this has been convincingly reported, and even in humans, we only find them in the medial temporal lobe and not any other brain region,” Mormann explained. “To me, [it’s] one of the most seminal discoveries of the last 50 years, at least, but has been largely ignored. And the reason why it’s been largely ignored is, in my opinion, because this type of electrophysiological research traditionally cannot be done in humans, for obvious ethical constraints.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as we've seen, there is one very particular circumstance in which it’s necessary to carry out such invasive procedures. Patients with seizures as a result of epilepsy may require exploratory surgery — invasive seizure diagnostics, it’s called — to determine if they would be good candidates for a neurosurgical resection where the seizure-generating area of the brain would be removed, taking away the condition and any neurological or cognitive deficits associated with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think there’s a paradigm shift involved in all this."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our job is to make sure that we found the seizure-generating area so that we can then provide the patient with three pieces of information. One, their chances of becoming permanently seizure-free if we resect that area of the brain, which reflects how certain we are that we’ve identified the epileptic focus. Two is what price they’ve got to pay, because there is often some residual function that might be gone once we remove [the epileptic tissue]. And the third one is the complication risk,” Mormann explained to Salon with evident care. &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/12/17/8_horrific_cures_for_mental_illness_through_the_ages_partner/" target="_blank"&gt;The history of lobotomy is such&lt;/a&gt; that no one would want to be associated with reckless brain surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a small proportion of this group of epilepsy patients, less than 10%, recording seizures using scalp EEG is enough to provide the necessary information. But in cases where they cannot reach a conclusion on those risks and benefits non-invasively, his team offers the patients diagnostic surgery in which they implant electrodes and use them to record seizures exactly where they are happening. The implants may be in for a week or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The area that is being implanted the most [or used to be] is the medial temporal lobe, simply because it’s very well-shielded from the outside on both sides, and also because that is the region that’s mandatory for episodic memory formation,” Mormann said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry Molaison — known for decades only as H.M. — became one of the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2649674/"&gt;most famous patients in neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; after losing his ability to form memories entirely in 1953. That incident, so unfortunate for him and so interesting for our understanding of memory, occurred due to a bilateral resection to control epileptic seizures that had blighted his life since the age of 10, possibly resulting from a minor bicycle accident. To say he had a bilateral resection means that the surgeons removed these structures on both hemispheres of the brain. The surgery was successful at curing the epilepsy, but left him with the inability to form new memories. (Interestingly, attempts to replicate the effects of Molaison’s surgery on memory in monkeys were unsuccessful at first, revealing that humans and monkeys use different parts of the brain for learning certain tasks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s safer to resect just one hemisphere. But if you choose the wrong one to remove, the patient will still have seizures, and now may have impaired memory as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That is why … it has become customary to be careful not to resect the wrong hippocampus, because simply, there’s no second attempt,” Mormann explained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Mormann believes, the research in humans has been largely ignored. In his view, semantic concept cells in humans are thought of as “a fancy version of place cells” at best. Place cells are cells found, so far, only in rodents, that fire at certain spots as a mouse or rat moves through a linear track, indicating a cell specific to certain locations. (As &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52295-5?fromPaywallRec=false"&gt;Mormann’s own recent research&lt;/a&gt; has affirmed, humans do also have location-specific neurons that play similarly specialized roles in spatial awareness.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think there’s a paradigm shift involved in all this,” said Quian Quiroga. While colleagues have been teaching his work to undergraduates for years now, “there might be some inertia not to take this paradigm shift because … we assume that the human brain is kind of like an extrapolated version of the workings of the animal brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that neuroscientists, have described certain principles in animal models, "assume that these principles will also apply to humans, although maybe with a bit of a higher complexity. And I think what we’re showing is that … we shouldn’t take this for granted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that this invalidates the use of animal models in neurology. But it means that, rather than expecting a rat’s brain or a monkey’s brain to tell us all about how things work in humans, the differences between their brains and ours may be what’s really of interest. In fact, Quian Quiroga is busy with experiments aimed at quantifying the differences between the way humans process information in the hippocampus or in the memory system in general compared to what’s been described over the last fifty years of memory research using other animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This paper we just published is the first that I expect to be a series of studies because this is just showing the tip of the iceberg,” Quian Quiroga said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What concept cells could mean for AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, all those years of focus on mouse and monkey brains as models for how we think have also informed our work in artificial intelligence. Might this explain why, impressive though it is, we have not yet replicated the way humans really think? It wasn't until 2020, after fifteen years of experimental evidence supporting the existence of concept cells, that three researchers writing &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64466-7" target="_blank"&gt;in Scientific Reports set out a theoretical justification&lt;/a&gt; for the possibility of such structures existing, and in fact for the likelihood of the existence of such cells in the hippocampus. "Three fundamental conditions, fulfilled by the human brain, ensure high cognitive functionality of single cells," the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till now though, it was the very different, prevailing understanding of the brain that has guided our development of artificial brains: that the coordinated action of countless neurons — a neural network — is what allows for the representation of abstract concepts. Although of course we do use a distributed neural network for many aspects of our cognition, now it seems that representing entire concepts using specific cells with semantic invariance might be a key difference between human intelligence and that of other animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps also of interest to those hoping to build artificial brains, what Quian Quiroga’s work suggests is a possible explanation for how it is that anatomically, the brain of a human and that of a chimpanzee is not all that different. The human’s is bigger, but not so much as to explain the very considerable difference in intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So my point is not that the human brain is different,” Quian Quiroga said. “It’s that the human brain must be working differently. It is just the fact that in the chimpanzee brain, you will have a visual stimulus going all the way from visual processing areas into your memory system. So you form memories based on pictures, based on images. In the human brain, the visual system comes to a point, and then you extract a meaning from it, and it’s only the meaning and not the stimulus itself that goes into the memory system”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our anatomy has barely changed from our common ancestor with chimpanzees. But language, it seems, has drastically changed how we use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lucuma, a South American fruit known for its caramel-like flavor, is gaining popularity as a lower-calorie, antioxidant-rich alternative to sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lucuma contains fiber, polyphenols, and carotenoids, which may support blood sugar regulation and heart health and help reduce oxidative stress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Typically sold as a powder, lucuma can be added to coffee, oatmeal, smoothies, and baked goods, but it’s less sweet than sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking to eat healthier, you might want to steer clear of added sugars. (These are sugars that food manufacturers add to products to enhance flavor or prolong shelf life, according to &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-sweet-danger-of-sugar#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20it%20is,%2C%22%20says%20Dr.%20Hu." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt;.) Consuming a diet high in added sugars can raise your &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.603653/full" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;risk&lt;/a&gt; of dying from heart disease, increase the chances of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6868459/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;developing&lt;/a&gt; Type 2 diabetes or certain &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29801420/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/too-much-sugar#cellular-aging" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;accelerate&lt;/a&gt; cellular aging. So if you want to live a longer, healthier life, replacing your regular cane sugar may be one of your best options. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That’s where alternative sweeteners — including everything from stevia, monk fruit, agave, and more — come in. Most can be found at your local grocery or health food store and are available in powder, crystal, or liquid form. But one you might not be familiar with is lucuma, a fruit from South America that resembles an orange avocado — and may offer just as many health benefits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lucuma, as a recent &lt;a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/aabc/a/j4sYFSQQYNXPwWBLjTnQZLH/#" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; shows, had “significant amounts of polyphenols, flavonoids, and carotenoids, known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.” Additionally, the research found that lucuma’s “fatty acid profile was also favorable, with a high percentage of α-linolenic acid, which is associated with numerous health benefits.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  So what, exactly, is lucuma — and should it take the place of sugar in your daily coffee? Here’s everything that researchers know so far about this potential superfood.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-lucuma-and-where-does-it-come-from"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What is lucuma and where does it come from? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lucuma is a fruit that grows on the lucuma tree, which is native to the Andean valleys of Bolivia, Peru, Chile, and Ecuador. Commonly referred to as the “Gold of the Incas” because of its bright yellow-orange color, lucuma was important to the Incas, who considered it to be a symbol of longevity and fertility. Today, it is still used in Peru, particularly in ice cream.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When ripe, lucuma’s flesh is starchy and sweet, with a flavor often likened to caramel, sweet potato, and maple syrup. The fruit is oval-shaped, with a pointed tip and a pit in the middle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The fruit typically &lt;a href="https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/full/10.1079/cabicompendium.43724" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;isn’t eaten raw&lt;/a&gt; due to its mealy texture, which is similar to a hard-boiled egg yolk. As a result, lucuma is dried and ground into a powder, which is available for purchase at health stores, organic markets, and online.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2174668/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; (USDA), one tablespoon of lucuma powder contains: 30 calories, one gram of protein, zero grams of fat, six grams of carbohydrates, three grams of total sugars, and two grams of fiber. This can be compared to table sugar, which &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionix.com/food/white-sugar/1-tbsp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;contains&lt;/a&gt; 49 calories, 13 grams of carbohydrates, and 0 grams of protein per tablespoon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lucuma is also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8434328/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich&lt;/a&gt; in antioxidants, particularly polyphenols and carotenoids, says &lt;a href="https://roxanaehsani.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Roxana Ehsani,&lt;/a&gt; MS, RD, CSSD, a sports dietitian. These carotenoids (which give the fruit its distinctive yellow-orange hue) support healthy vision, while its polyphenols and vitamin C content provide protection against diseases, Ehsani notes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, these antioxidants help combat oxidative stress in the body, according to &lt;a href="http://www.samanthacassetty.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Samantha Cassetty&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, a nutrition and wellness expert, founder of &lt;a href="https://samanthacassetty.com/membership/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Sam’s Plate&lt;/a&gt;, and co-author of the book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sugar-Shock-Hidden-Smart-Swaps/dp/1950785009" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sugar Shock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Oxidative stress occurs when you take in fewer antioxidants than your body produces and can contribute to conditions such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and heart disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Oxidative stress destabilizes our cells, leaving them prone to damage that can promote chronic inflammation and diseases like cancer, heart disease, and neurodegenerative disease,” Cassetty says. “So, eating antioxidant-rich foods is a great way to help prevent oxidative stress.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, lucuma powder’s fiber content helps support digestive and gut health, Cassetty notes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While lucuma fruit contains the most potential health benefits, the powder has “still been shown to retain strong antioxidant activity, indicating that lucuma may provide health benefits even in certain processed forms,” says Scott Keatley, RD, co-founder of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lucuma powder is rich in polyphenols, flavonoids, and carotenoids, which support vision, immune function, and skin health, Keatley explains. The fruit also provides vitamin C, iron, zinc, calcium, potassium, and dietary fiber, per Keatley. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lucuma has also been linked to a few health benefits, including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It offers some level of nutrition &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many sweeteners are non-nutritive, meaning they don’t provide anything in the nutrition department, but lucuma powder is different. “Unlike refined sugar, lucuma retains fiber, vitamins, and minerals, offering more than just empty calories,” Keatley says. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It may regulate blood sugar levels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 2009 test-tube &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19459727/#full-view-affiliation-1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that lucuma may help prevent the actions of alpha-glucosidase, a gut enzyme that aids in breaking down sugars. By inhibiting this enzyme's function, lucuma could theoretically help reduce spikes in blood glucose levels after meals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some researchers have also suggested that lucuma has a low glycemic index, which ranks foods from one to 100 based on how quickly they raise blood sugar levels, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/low-glycemic-index-diet/art-20048478" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mayo Clinic.&lt;/a&gt; However, additional studies on the nutritional content of lucuma are needed to confirm this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Added sugar is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9471313/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; for contributing to bodily inflammation, which is linked to a host of serious diseases like heart disease and cancer. But the antioxidants in lucuma may help reduce inflammation, Keatley says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The same study suggests that lucuma may inhibit the action of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), which plays a role in regulating blood pressure. Excessive ACE activity is associated with hypertension and heart failure, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/ace-inhibitors/art-20047480#:~:text=These%20medicines%20are%20commonly%20used,arteries%20to%20lower%20blood%20pressure." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. This research suggests that lucuma could function like an ACE inhibitor, although further studies are necessary to verify these findings in humans.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, scientific research on lucuma is quite limited, notes &lt;a href="https://www.kristiblackburn.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stephanie Crabtree&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, a holistic registered dietitian specializing in gut health, hormone balance, and whole food nutrition — so approach these findings with caution. “Most studies available are small, preliminary, or conducted in laboratory settings rather than human trials,” Crabtree says.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--instagram"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-is-lucuma-more-nutritious-than-other-sweeteners"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Is lucuma more nutritious than other sweeteners? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s true that lucuma has fewer calories and carbohydrates than cane sugar, agave, honey, or maple syrup. However, it has more calories and carbs than stevia, sucralose (Splenda), or saccharin (Sweet ‘N Low), but it also offers more fiber and antioxidants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re seeking fiber and antioxidants, Cassetty recommends traditional fruits and vegetables. “I don’t suggest using a sweetener for the purpose of getting a nutritional boost, but it’s a nice perk when you’re choosing a sweetener,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And, like any other sweetener, you shouldn’t go overboard. “Remember that it still contains calories and carbohydrates, which is especially important to consider if you’re watching your carb count, say, if you have diabetes or prediabetes,” Cassetty says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, if you have any fruit allergies or gastrointestinal issues, Cassetty says to exercise caution when trying lucuma for the first time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-can-i-use-lucuma-as-a-sugar-substitute"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_68-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How can I use lucuma as a sugar substitute? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lucuma can be added to anything you usually sweeten, such as oatmeal, tea, or coffee. The purée can serve as a pudding or custard base in baked goods, while lucuma powder may be mixed with flour in cake and muffin recipes or used as a thickening agent in soups and stews, says Vivian Villa, owner and chef at the food product development and consultancy company Hot, Sour, Salty, Sweet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_70-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_71-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, if you’re following a recipe that requires cane sugar, you should use double the amount of lucuma powder since it is less sweet, Villa explains.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Is that true? Are some activities better than others?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When Jennifer O’Brien, a psychologist who studies Alzheimer’s disease prevention at the University of South Florida, gives public lectures, she says she’s frequently asked if activities like crossword puzzles or word games will stave off age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It’s the No. 1 question,” she said. “There’s this very pervasive, common belief that if I do these types of games, it’s going to help me as I age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The truth, she and other experts said, is more complicated. The science on whether specific brain activities are helpful, or if some are more effective than others, is limited and hard to evaluate, and other aspects of your life may be more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But certain kinds of brain activities could, potentially, strengthen your cognitive skills as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-4d916e3"&gt;What the Science Suggests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Very little research has been done on whether a specific brain stimulating activity, like a puzzle or a word game on its own, can affect memory loss.

He added, “Gum disease, which is a direct result of poor oral hygiene, has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular problems.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. Dr Saurabh Sethi further said, “Studies show that people who brush their teeth regularly along with getting dental cleanings tend to have healthier hearts and a lower risk of heart diseases. So, keeping up with your oral hygiene is one of the easiest ways to keep your heart healthy.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By incorporating brushing every night into your daily routine, you can help safeguard your heart from fatal diseases and even heart failure, accoring to Dr Saurabh Sethi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

He had lifted his glasses and mobile phone as he passed the hall table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;As BBC News NI's health correspondent, I am used to telling patients' stories but Joe isn't just any patient - he's my dad and this is our family's story of a heart attack, a cardiac nurse and how we all learned to live again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Joe, pictured with his wife, has many reasons to celebrate&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;My dad has been active all his life - even in retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However in November, in the early hours of a Saturday morning, our world was shaken when his heart decided to hold a mini protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;I woke up to seven missed calls and a message to ring my older brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He picked up and calmly said: "Dad is OK, but he's had a heart attack and is in hospital, mum is with him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;What happened that night is now a familiar story in the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mum initially thought it was just indigestion. But as the pressure and my dad's worried expression increased, she dialled 999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to my mum, a "lovely woman with a Scottish accent" asked her to describe his symptoms and the advice was for him to chew four aspirins without water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;My dad said within fifteen minutes of doing so, the pressure had eased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The call handler said an ambulance would not be available for maybe hours and suggested my mum or someone else could take him to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Forty minutes later dad was at the emergency department - thanks to my brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It was an anxious time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Eventually he was admitted to a ward, and we waited for a diagnosis and treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Susan Kane is a cardiac nurse and has been helping Joe with his rehabilitation &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A weekend admission meant we had to wait until Monday, when a consultant said dad needed a stent procedure to unblock an artery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Staff said a stent was like the refill of a ballpoint pen and when inserted into the artery it allowed the blood to flow to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A second artery which was described as "furry" could be treated with medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dad's slot to have the procedure became available during visiting hours - a porter and nurse arrived and whisked him away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He was back within the hour.

photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;85% of women in the US report having at least one &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/woman-tries-rates-weird-pregnancy-food-cravings/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;food craving&lt;/a&gt; during their pregnancy, with sweets being the most common food urge among pregnant women. While these food urges are very real, scientifically, the exact cause for them isn’t figured out yet. However, researchers believe that they can appear for a few reasons. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;First is the hormonal change in progesterone and ghrelin (the hunger hormone), which can result in increased appetite. Then there’s the theory that the body may signal specific cravings to compensate for nutrient deficiencies, like calcium or iron. The second to last is the fact that pregnancy enhances the sense of taste and smell, making some foods more irresistible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lastly, some experts think that it’s the environment that usually gives cues for the brain to desire specific foods, as with every person who is not pregnant. “You get this idea or memory or you smell a smell or see a commercial that reminds you of that food and you say, ‘Oh boy I’d really like to have that right now,’” said Nicole Avena, a neuroscientist and author of What To Eat When You’re Pregnant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only for pregnant women, these cravings might be harder to control due to hormonal fluctuations. Despite this, experts say that it’s not an excuse for bad behavior or unhealthy eating, which can have a serious impact on their &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/relationships/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt; with others and even their and the baby’s health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Using hormones as an excuse for bad behavior is wrong&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="shareable-post-image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="fiance-ate-daughters-cupcake-23" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/fiance-ate-daughters-cupcake/?image_id=fiance-ate-daughters-cupcake-23.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Woman Wants Apology After She Eats Little Girl’s Cupcake: “It’s Called Being Pregnant, Jerks!”" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/fiance-ate-daughters-cupcake/?media_id=fiance-ate-daughters-cupcake-23" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fiance-ate-daughters-cupcake-23.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8399946" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fiance-ate-daughters-cupcake-23.jpg" alt="Pregnant woman sitting on a couch, wearing a white shirt, hand on belly." title="Pregnant woman sitting on a couch, wearing a white shirt, hand on belly." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-pregnant-woman-is-sitting-on-a-couch-NU4jIpx9YvU" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;George Dagerotip/Unsplash (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’ve seen some women use their hormones as an excuse for bad behavior. There are some who treat spouse, children, or coworkers badly, and neglect important responsibilities, and then expect a free pass because they are “hormonal.” That’s just wrong!” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drcarolministries.com/women-and-hormones-no-excuse/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;licensed OB-GYN physician Dr. Carol Peters-Tanksley. “There’s no excuse for bad behavior just because you’re ‘hormonal,’” she explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For (pregnant or not) women who struggle with their hormones, she suggests paying attention to their overall health. Eating healthy, getting appropriate exercise and sleep, investing time in yourself and your relationships, and avoiding stress are all things that impact how women feel. If they’re ignored, it becomes convenient to blame hormones for any health discrepancies or mood swings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You are still responsible for your own health, but getting input from a physician, nutritionist, or psychologist may give you important help where you need it. If you’re struggling, you don’t have to go it alone. Remember that how you behave impacts many other people: if you can’t get help for yourself, do it for them,” recommended Dr. Peters-Tanksley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And for men, remember that we women need you! We need your loving support, your encouragement to get help, and your feedback on how we are coming across. It’s OK to hold us accountable for our behavior. Your support means a lot,” she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If pregnant women constantly give in to hormones and satisfy their food cravings that are usually unhealthy, they can gain too much weight and put the baby at higher risk of obesity later in life. So instead of giving in to unhealthy food urges, pregnant women should try to replace them with something healthier, like carrots, almonds, or apples with peanut butter. “It’s going to make eating well so much easier and more enjoyable, and is certainly going to have health benefits for you and the baby,” said Avena. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Readers agreed that the fiancée shouldn’t use pregnancy as excuse for bad behavior&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="shareable-post-image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="shareable-post-image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="shareable-post-image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

Why can’t we remember our early childhood experiences? Freud called the phenomenon infantile amnesia, and for many years scientists have wondered whether it’s a result of failure to create memories or just a failure to retrieve them. Now new research appears to point to an answer. To find out more, Ian Sample talks to Nick Turk-Browne, a professor of psychology at Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPeGNwR0tFVFEtSlI5cC1hVkZDNHdSVHc1b1BXSVJ6c1hqRmg4blJyQUk1Y2U5dmliSVJReUQyZmdzWFBTSGpRV3pSSWhsQjdsNExqWkJ2UFkzNTFTZkpQM2J0cUZfX3o4SWpVV3NyYldRc1lxWFhreFJBSHNvMG54U1NsbkVBTWsza0NNcUxsZ05Ma0tYSUVXckVjZnl1Q0JKdVp1Mg</guid></item><item><title>These Popular Treatments Don’t Work for Back Pain, According to New Research - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxQZEFMZXlJcE1Jd0JJV2c3OERGNjFBUGpGYzAtQUFwb3NBRnZKSXVXaE9KcnJ5aXZZRUNpNGZCck90cFZnNGJkejJMYi05S181dEQzSV9tbFlINlFYa1lneGY3OEl1dU80RFFEZEw2N0lqLUREY0ZoZkV6dmQ2ZDQtRE9GYlg1b3RPYjFjbVZvSkhKTmpWNWQ0aFVMSF9ObFJPSGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 04:06:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQZEFMZXlJcE1Jd0JJV2c3OERGNjFBUGpGYzAtQUFwb3NBRnZKSXVXaE9KcnJ5aXZZRUNpNGZCck90cFZnNGJkejJMYi05S181dEQzSV9tbFlINlFYa1lneGY3OEl1dU80RFFEZEw2N0lqLUREY0ZoZkV6dmQ2ZDQtRE9GYlg1b3RPYjFjbVZvSkhKTmpWNWQ0aFVMSF9ObFJPSGc</guid></item><item><title>11 Vegetables That Are High in Magnesium - Health.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE80eHNlb2p0cDZaRzRuN2RFVkxxa0V4YmEwTi1IZzllbmRxcnczRE5ybU9pbjBULUpDZW9PQ0VFNWZ0VDhFZWlnOXNyaEdTdVhGSzVGZDhzbUFhSW5taExKTXRCMHQ1aVNi?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS — The parents of a six-year-old girl who &lt;a href="/article/news/health/texas-measles-death-outbreak-lubbock/285-636380ac-1d18-4404-999d-b804f40137af#%3A~%3Atext=LUBBOCK%252C%2520Texas%2520%25E2%2580%2594%2520A%2520person%2520who,the%2520first%2520death%2520was%2520reported." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;died of measles&lt;/a&gt; in late February told an anti-vaccine activist organization they remain opposed to vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We would absolutely not take the MMR,” the mother told representatives from Children’s Health Defense, the nonprofit that conducted the interview and posted it online.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MMR is the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine which researchers have &lt;a href="/article/news/health/answers-to-your-questions-and-general-guidelines-on-measles-outbreak-in-texas/287-48e4c451-22e5-403b-b810-bfda235c3d03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;proven to be safe and highly effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parents’ names are not revealed in the interview, and they switched between English and German with the use of a translator at various points.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family is part of the Mennonite community in West Texas identified by the state as &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the center of a measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; that began in January and has since infected more than 300 people.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mother and father said their daughter was the first of their five children to become infected. She developed a rash before her fever spiked and her breathing became abnormal, the mother said. They took the child to a hospital in Lubbock where she ended up in ICU and on a ventilator.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pneumonia is a complication that can develop from measles infections.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl was unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children’s Health Defense was founded by &lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/trump-will-nominate-acting-cdc-director-susan-monarez/507-0f344d33-8433-4ea5-a43e-27d6d19553d8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy, now the Secretary of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; under President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It promotes an anti-vaccine agenda.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Children’s Health Defense representatives never appear on camera during the interview, but their voices are heard asking about the treatment the girl received and whether they have changed their stance on vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mother wiped her eyes and cried as she described saying goodbye to her daughter, but according to the translator the mother also said in German, “Don’t do the shots. There are doctors who can help with measles. They’re not as bad as they’re making it out to be.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mother said she too contracted the virus and was infected on the day of her daughter’s funeral.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their four surviving children developed rashes, fevers, and coughs, but they recovered after being treated by a doctor in their community, she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The measles wasn’t that bad, and they got over it pretty quickly,” she said of the other children's cases.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Erin Carlson, a clinical professor and director of graduate public health studies at the University of Texas at Arlington, said the erosion of trust in the “unequivocally safe and effective” MMR vaccine is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Misinformation and disinformation cost us lives,” Carlson said. “And not only does it cost us lives, but it also costs us the quality of life. Maybe you survive a disease but that doesn’t mean you survive it well.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An uptick in vaccinations is the only way to stop an outbreak, public health experts agree.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are devastating complications from measles, but we don't see these types of devastating complications or side effects from the vaccine,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles had been considered eliminated in the US, but it is one of the most contagious viral diseases known to man.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the father of the girl who died told the translator, “God does no wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, “It was her time on earth. She’s better off now where she is,” according to the translator.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

They are hoping that an expensive form of treatment will help him recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Five years on from the first Covid-19 lockdown, James is one of 2 million people in the UK today believed to be suffering from long Covid.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Registered dietitians say skipping breakfast is the No. 1 habit to break for weight loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skipping breakfast can make you eat more later on and lead to blood sugar spikes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead, plan your meals ahead and include plenty of protein and vegetables. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s often said that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. But when it comes to losing weight, many people skip the morning meal to jump-start weight loss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, registered dietitians beg to differ. In fact, they tell us that the most important morning habit to break for weight loss is skipping breakfast. Why? “When people skip breakfast, they tend to make poorer food choices throughout the day, eating larger portions and choosing higher-sugar foods,” says &lt;a href="https://www.armywcap.com/soldier-athletes/high-performance/maj-kelly-kaim" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Maj. Kelly Kaim, M.S., RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;, lead sports dietitian for the Army’s World Class Athlete Program.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Skipping breakfast can have a domino effect on the rest of the day’s food choices, which may make it more difficult to lose weight. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You May Eat More Calories at Your Next Meal &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may not be thinking about lunch or dinner when you decide to skip breakfast. But that can set you up to eat more calories at your next meal, says&lt;a href="https://www.laineyyounkin.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Lainey Younkin, M.S., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, a Boston-based registered dietitian. “Ever find yourself raiding the kitchen in the late afternoon or after dinner?” she asks. “Nine times out of ten, it’s because you didn’t eat enough at breakfast.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research agrees. One study found that adults who skipped breakfast ate more calories at subsequent meals. Another downside? The breakfast skippers in this study also had poorer-quality diets than those who ate breakfast. It should be noted that the breakfast skippers did consume fewer overall calories throughout the day. However, this study only analyzed two days of diet recalls, which is not an accurate representation of a person’s long-term eating habits. So, more research is needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You’re More Likely to Overeat at Night &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Skipping breakfast may trigger overeating, especially in the evening. That means you’re likely to eat the majority of your calories during the less-active times of the day. “When you eat a balanced breakfast, you stay full and energized longer, and the nighttime cravings essentially disappear, making it easier to stay in a slight calorie deficit for weight loss,” says Younkin. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Switching to a larger breakfast allows you to use that fuel all day and not have extra unused calories versus eating a ton at night and not using it, which then can be stored as fat,” says Kaim. In other words, redistributing your daily calories may influence weight loss independent of a change in total calorie intake.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You May Experience Blood Sugar Spikes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating breakfast helps stabilize blood sugar after an overnight fast. “Skipping breakfast or not eating enough in the morning throws off blood sugar balance, which plays a huge role in weight loss,” says Younkin. A small study of men ages 19 to 24 found that on days when they skipped breakfast, they experienced spikes in blood sugar and abnormally high insulin levels after lunch compared to days when they ate breakfast. This may explain why they reported significantly more hunger when they missed breakfast versus days when they ate it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Other research has also found that skipping breakfast leads to poor blood sugar control in those with type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a balanced breakfast is just the first step toward your weight-loss goals. These strategies may make it easier for you to lose weight, no meal-skipping required!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a Plan. &lt;/strong&gt;When you don’t plan what you’re going to eat ahead of time, you risk letting your day dictate what happens to you and your eating, says&lt;a href="https://80twentynutrition.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Christy Brissette, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and president of 80 Twenty Nutrition. “That’s setting yourself up for chaotic eating and disappointment,” she says. Instead, Brissette recommends taking a few minutes in the evening to plan what you’ll eat the next day. “This is called precommitment. You’re making a promise to yourself and setting goals,” she explains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat More Protein. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Protein&lt;/a&gt; has taken center stage in the weight-loss conversation. And for good reason. It plays a role in satiety and helps to maintain calorie-burning muscle. When it comes to weight loss, Younkin recommends focusing on upping protein at breakfast first. “A balanced meal has high-fiber carbohydrates, protein and fat,” she says. “People often eat a somewhat balanced breakfast, like eggs and toast or Greek yogurt with berries, but it doesn’t have enough protein.” She suggests aiming for 20 to 30 grams of protein at breakfast and 5 to 10 grams of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; plus some healthy fat like avocado. Some of our favorite&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7926222/high-protein-breakfasts-to-keep-you-satisfied/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt; high-protein breakfast recipes&lt;/a&gt; are also packed with veggies, making them a good source of fiber as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load Up on Veggies.&lt;/strong&gt; Speaking of vegetables, they’re one of the best foods for weight loss. Yet, most of us don’t eat enough of them.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Try to make colorful vegetables half of your plate to get plenty of nutrients and for very few calories,” says Brissette. The visual of filling your plate with produce can also be beneficial for an abundance mindset. “Vegetables are full of fiber, water, vitamins and minerals but low in calories, so they fill you up while helping you stay in a calorie deficit,” adds Younkin. She recommends dedicating half your plate to vegetables and then dividing the remaining half between lean protein and fiber-rich whole grains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remain Flexible. &lt;/strong&gt;Research has shown that diets can be difficult to stick to, especially over the long term.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s why many dietitians recommend a more flexible approach. “We all have different likes, dislikes, needs, behaviors and desires,” says&lt;a href="https://rebelliousrd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="5" rel="nofollow"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Philadelphia-based registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://rebelliousrd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="6" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy S. Margulies, RD, LDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. “There is no cookie-cutter approach out there that is successful in the long term. If you feel you are on a “diet” versus a meal plan that you can sustain for the long haul, you will regain the weight you worked so hard to lose.” If weight loss is your goal, looking at success through the lens of long-term weight loss is essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you regularly skip breakfast, now is the time to add it back to your day. You’ll not only improve the quality of your diet. You may also lose weight, thanks to fewer cravings and blood sugar spikes and less of a tendency to overeat in the evening. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keep in mind that no matter what change you make for weight loss, it must be sustainable to have a significant effect. “If you can’t keep doing something forever, you won’t maintain the results forever either,” says Younkin. “Aim for balanced meals about 80% of the time throughout the week and the rest of the time eat foods you enjoy without guilt or feeling like you need to make up for it.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

She later told police that she began bringing her own water bottle instead of drinking the “sour” water. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The employee eventually “noticed her water from her personal water bottle that she brought from the store smelled nasty,” the documents said, adding that she decided to dispose of the bottle rather than investigate further.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Janitor caught on camera ‘inserting penis’ into water bottle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the office lacked security cameras, the woman purchased a small camera online and attached it to her computer. She also placed a large water bottle in the camera's view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later that evening, the woman was notified of movement on the camera. “What she witnessed moments later was far worse than anyone could imagine,” court documents revealed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The video clearly showed the nighttime janitor, Lucio Diaz, approach M.A.’s desk as if to clean, set the cleaning rag and cleaning bottle on the desk, unzip his pants, pull out his penis, grab the water bottle sitting on the desk, unscrew the cap, and begin to insert his penis into the water bottle (turning it upwards to ensure the water in the bottle touched his penis), and rub his penis on the mouth of the bottle,” report quoted court documents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He then put the cap back on the bottle, set it back where he found it, zipped up his pants, grabbed the cleaning bottle and rag, and continued to ‘clean’ the desk. Lucio Diaz was not phased, he was not nervous—he had done this before—and it had now become just a part of his daily ‘cleaning’ ritual,” the report added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, Diaz admitted to the crimes during police questioning, saying he “did it because he knew [the employee] would drink it the next day” and mentioned having a “sickness.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The woman later underwent several STD tests, all of which came back positive for Herpes simplex virus type 1, a condition she had never tested positive for before, the complaint revealed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tests on Diaz also showed he was positive for the same virus, along with chlamydia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following this, several other women working at the medical practice found they had contracted STDs. The Independent reported it has reviewed multiple civil suits filed against Diaz.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On October 10, 2022, another woman who was targeted by Diaz informed police that she tested positive for herpes simplex virus type 1 and chlamydia after consuming water from her bottle that had been contaminated with his urine, as stated in the court documents, &lt;a rel="dofollow" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/03/24/janitor-urinating-bottles-houston/82641024007/" target="_blank"&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;USA Today. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 02:26:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAJBVV95cUxNV3NWTkhLcEp6SU9QUHBRZktCb1NiRnp3TEVWemVfaDlycmE3REFwd2lWZmNsOG0xY2M2OWpJNGYwUnd0MmQ1ZEJhbXI4cDNzUzdjckVWRkV6RGY2MWM4UU42bV9rS1VtXzA3eXlOOVVRYmhIN1dzSVBLaHo2UVNpT3pPbXNqUElZaWhNQ3lreU9NZFozZVJydDJ6Y2dFT3Z1ZVdXbDVqT2pKWkhNX0VIZTkwdVRrYy1jSGhtczBEdmFrYWt1NlBpQTNjeWlabFNvQzRYdGw3dmhWU1Y5VmgxaHVFVDFmZHoxQmg2dHA1UWo1M0tFRnBsVlRlMk5CT2g2</guid></item><item><title>Snake Bite Victim West of Miranda Medivacked to Hospital - Redheaded Blackbelt</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxQS29uaXJ4TnZoelVIMnVHSlRHVS1mdmpVbE8wYkVzelpGNVYzTjhWM2NJUWkxSkJydEFoUTJPeEtKVTFIaV9EZ1lPNFRKSFQyVE9NZmItQkx5S1NWYVlzSmFTV29mQ0djdGhuWW01UEZ3QndzZXJHNDZmcWlfdVJ6QU1QTF9xbVB2SmQtSlRPUWRuZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Redheaded Blackbelt</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 02:17:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQS29uaXJ4TnZoelVIMnVHSlRHVS1mdmpVbE8wYkVzelpGNVYzTjhWM2NJUWkxSkJydEFoUTJPeEtKVTFIaV9EZ1lPNFRKSFQyVE9NZmItQkx5S1NWYVlzSmFTV29mQ0djdGhuWW01UEZ3QndzZXJHNDZmcWlfdVJ6QU1QTF9xbVB2SmQtSlRPUWRuZw</guid></item><item><title>Pakistani actor Nimra Khan shares 7-day diet plan following which she lost 8 kilos in a week - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAJBVV95cUxNNDgxZ05GaFB5NE5SSFc5VFlyaWIyY3laV1NJWFpkZTN0SjJMbWpMSG92ZTh6b21DQ2laVkE3QlhfUVNZYzJUX01hYmRISm16YllYVzZKNVlidVpKVS1jME5iS1h1cmJpMVBtbkRlWUh3ckJMeU9kQWFZall1QkNnc1QzQVNJVFI0S1llR2NacHc5RXhQa0JzYzM4SDF5cWZxZjJyZGZNSnYzNURZT1VGSE1vSGFyTWx0SkJibFhCT2IyaXp0LTJpZnJ6MDF1V1dzMmcydTJhd1FBSTBCMTg5QzRZQXR2cUFPNU1XNTdaUzlGSnNVNW1WZ2JBa1hqOGJUeW1YN053VUNlVnp0TUp2cmJIc00zTW5odGVNdHFhNXhFamk0d1FOcFRFNmd6ZkNkRlpvakVyd3M0bEpk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nimra Khan, a popular Pakistani actor known for series like Kis Din Mera Viyah Howay Ga, recently shared her weight loss routine. In a show, Nimra revealed that she lost almost 8 kilos in just a week following a very strict diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how the 34 year old achieved the extraordinary weight loss within 7 days. Nimra has revealed that she ate three egg whites, soaked chia seeds in lukewarm water, lemon and honey, apple and green tea for the entire day for a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To lose weight, you need to set clear goals first," Nimra said in the interview. “I had an apple every three hours and green tea every two hours. This routine was repeated in the morning, afternoon, and evening for seven days," she revealed in the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a 7-day diet plan, and no one has ever completed it for more than 4 days. Most people remain consistent for the first 3 days but give up by the 4th day," she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See more:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/weight-loss-tips-to-lose-inches-of-stubborn-belly-fat-in-a-healthy-way/featureshow/114461358.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; Weight Loss Tips to Lose Inches of Stubborn Belly Fat in a Healthy Way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are crash diets healthy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the diet looks promising, there are a few caveats everyone must know. The diet is restrictive and lacks nutrients. While it may lead to short-term weight loss due to severe calorie deficit, it is not a balanced or sustainable approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egg whites contain protein, which is essential for muscle health, and chia seeds contain fiber and omega-3 fatty acids that aid digestion and heart health. Green tea contains antioxidants and can mildly increase metabolism. The diet is not sufficient in carbohydrates, healthy fats, and necessary vitamins and minerals. Lack of complex carbohydrates and calories can result in weakness, fatigue, and lack of concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For healthy weight loss, a balanced diet that consists of lean proteins, healthy fats, whole grains, and vegetables is important. Severe dieting causes slowing down of metabolism, muscle loss, and nutrient deficiencies. It can also induce cravings and result in overeating once normal eating patterns resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthier and more efficient way to lose weight would be by having balanced meals with plenty of nutrients. Incorporating foods such as whole grains, nuts, seeds, vegetables, and lean protein while keeping a calorie deficit will ensure gradual and stable fat loss. Proper hydration and regular exercise are also important roles in a healthy weight loss journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See more: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/how-to-gain-weight-tips-on-weight-gaining-through-proper-diet-and-nutrition/featureshow/115659380.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;How to gain weight: Tips on weight gaining through proper diet and nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 02:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAJBVV95cUxNNDgxZ05GaFB5NE5SSFc5VFlyaWIyY3laV1NJWFpkZTN0SjJMbWpMSG92ZTh6b21DQ2laVkE3QlhfUVNZYzJUX01hYmRISm16YllYVzZKNVlidVpKVS1jME5iS1h1cmJpMVBtbkRlWUh3ckJMeU9kQWFZall1QkNnc1QzQVNJVFI0S1llR2NacHc5RXhQa0JzYzM4SDF5cWZxZjJyZGZNSnYzNURZT1VGSE1vSGFyTWx0SkJibFhCT2IyaXp0LTJpZnJ6MDF1V1dzMmcydTJhd1FBSTBCMTg5QzRZQXR2cUFPNU1XNTdaUzlGSnNVNW1WZ2JBa1hqOGJUeW1YN053VUNlVnp0TUp2cmJIc00zTW5odGVNdHFhNXhFamk0d1FOcFRFNmd6ZkNkRlpvakVyd3M0bEpk</guid></item><item><title>Glow In The Dark PCBs Are Pretty Cool - Hackaday</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE9xSFNwSzl0bHRSdXhpa0p1UW5ZekNYOGM5UVViQ0lyS0QzSjhuZjdhdGNLQTBGcGVmN1hzblJTOHd6ajJQT0JaaVNNLTk0RDZJWEk5Nk1McHdNaHl3Q1V1ZjhtaVM0TnZXaHpRRFp3THh0ZV9RZnRRZFJR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" id="post-769152" class="post-769152 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-pcb-hacks tag-glow-in-the-dark tag-pcb tag-pcbway"&gt;
    

    &lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What if circuit boards could glow in the dark? It’s a fun question, and one [Botmatrix] sought to answer when approached by manufacturer PCBWay to run a project together. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdmOeqohdNs" target="_blank"&gt;It turns out that it’s quite possible to make glowing PCBs, with attractive results.&lt;/a&gt; (Video after the break.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, PCBWay has developed a workable glow-in-the-dark silkscreen material that can be applied to printed circuit boards. As a commercial board house, PCBWay hasn’t rushed to explain how precisely they pulled off this feat, but we don’t imagine that it involved anything more than adding some glow-in-the-dark powder to their usual silkscreen ink, but we can only speculate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On [Botmatrix]’s end, his video steps through some neat testing of the performance of the boards. They’re tested using sensors to determine how well they glow over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem like a visual gimmick, and to an extent, it’s just a bit of fun. But still, [Botmatrix] notes that it could have some practical applications too. For example, glow-in-the-dark silkscreen could be used to highlight specific test points on a board or similar, which could be instantly revealed with the use of a UV flashlight. It’s an edge case, but a compelling one. It’s also likely to be very fun for creating visually reactive conference badges or in other applications where the PCB plays a major cosmetic role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Botmatrix] says these are potentially the first commercially-available glow-in-the-dark printed PCBs. We love glow in the dark stuff; &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2025/01/20/diy-strontium-aluminate-glows-in-the-dark/"&gt;we’ve even explored how to make your own glowing material before, too&lt;/a&gt;. .&lt;/p&gt;

That goes off, and I'm like: 'Oh no'," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He was told he'd tested positive for gonorrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His was one of more than 85,000 cases in England last year - the highest level ever recorded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Numbers are similarly high across the rest of the UK and have more than doubled over the last decade. Catching gonorrhoea once doesn't stop you from getting it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I went from having no STIs in my life, to having three or four in the space of three months. It was ridiculous," Max tells BBC Newsbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Gonorrhoea is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Many, like Max, show no symptoms but it can cause pain in the joints and genitals, coloured discharge and problems getting pregnant. Using a condom during sex is usually said to be the best way of reducing the risk of catching it, but doesn't eliminate it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It can be treated with a single injection of antibiotics, although&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ceq5j784n7go" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt; a small number of treatment-resitant cases&lt;/a&gt; have been found in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Let's get it done'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In November 2023, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended a targeted roll-out of the MenB vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Primarily designed to tackle Meningitis B in children, the JCVI found the treatment was roughly 40% effective at preventing people from contracting and spreading gonorrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The body, which considers whether different immunisations should be offered on the NHS, said it would be cost-effective if given to people who are most at risk of catching gonorrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;That includes gay and bisexual men and people who have had an STI in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The JCVI said the money saved from fewer appointments and antibiotic treatments would be greater than the cost of the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Matt Phillips, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH), tells BBC Newsbeat it's "pushing for this to happen as soon as possible".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If we don't deal with it now, we're going to see more people with serious types of gonorrhoea and more cases of antibiotic resistance," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The science says we should do this, the JCVI says we should do this. Let's get it done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Other charities working in sexual health tell BBC Newsbeat they agree, including the Terrence Higgins Trust which says "it's time to put money where it needs to be. The time is now".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A spokesperson for the Department for Health and Social Care says "we want everyone to have good access to sexual health services and treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We're currently considering the JCVI advice and we will update in due course."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They also added: "Last month we announced a boost of almost £200m to the public health grant, which funds sexual health clinics across the country".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'There's a lot of shame around it'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Max, who creates educational online content on sexual health and wellbeing aimed at gay and bisexual men, says he would "absolutely" take the vaccine if he was offered it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He shared his own gonnorhoea diagnosis online and believes we should be more open about discussing STIs to reduce the stigma around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"There's a lot of shame around it," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"People think it's dirty. I felt like talking about it online not only normalised getting tested and having the treatment, but also took away the shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Even if you're doing everything right, you can still get an STI".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The latest data on STIs shows under-25s, black men and gay and bisexual men are most likely to catch gonnorhoea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Max says he's often had to work harder to get information on sexual health which he didn't get in school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I think as queer people we have to go out of our way to get the information," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's not something we're actively taught".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'I've gotten gonorrhoea repeatedly'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One of the organisations looking to change that is The Love Tank, based in London.

&lt;p&gt;This one is a head scratcher. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s no denying that the internet loves a good hack — especially if it’s one that will help prevent the crapulence feeling that comes on the morning after consuming one too many espresso martinis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest quirky health hack is milk thistle supplements being used to prevent nasty hangovers. In a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lucyconlanxx/video/7336271554596146465?q=milk%20thistle&amp;amp;t=1742852925396" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;video &lt;/a&gt;of a TikTok user raving about the herbal remedy, she told her viewers: “Last week I went out and took two of these before a night of drinking and I woke up and ran a 5k the next day.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But before you jump on the milk thistle bandwagon, there’s more to know about this plant medicine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, milk thistle in its purest form looks like a tall plant with pretty purple flowers — something you might stick in a vase and put on display in your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, milk thistle is known for more than just its good looks. Technically speaking, the plant’s seeds extract &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/milk-thistle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;silymarin&lt;/a&gt; — which is a mixture of compounds known for its antioxidant properties. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes in different forms — capsules, tablets and liquid extracts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years — dating back to the 16th century — silymarin has been used as an herbal remedy for treating a number of ailments — including liver disorders. It’s also said to help pregnant women increase their breast milk production. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regarding the liver, milk thistle helps by blocking toxins from reaching liver cells and for reducing inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/herb/milk-thistle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mount Sinai&lt;/a&gt;, some studies show that milk thistle can help improve liver function and increase survival chances in people with alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis — which is inflammation of the liver and liver disease, both caused by excessive alcohol consumption. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, experts are hesitant about people popping a milk thistle supplement thinking it will allow them to down several shots of tequila without feeling it the next day. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it could help support healthy liver function — the research that has been done on milk thistle is still very limited and nowhere claims that it’s a one and done &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/milk-thistle-hangover#:~:text=Despite%20these%20potential%20benefits%2C%20milk,be%20considered%20a%20hangover%20remedy.&amp;amp;text=Milk%20thistle%20may%20aid%20various,it's%20effective%20for%20treating%20hangovers." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hangover cure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, silymarin &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; help &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/milk-thistle-hangover#recommendation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;minimize some hangover symptoms&lt;/a&gt; — like body aches — but that’s about the extent of it.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;People with certain &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/03/health/5-supplements-you-should-avoid-if-you-have-metabolic-syndrome/"&gt;plant allergies&lt;/a&gt; should also be hesitant about consuming milk thistle. For those who are allergic to plants like ragweed, marigold or daisy — they may experience an allergy to milk thistle since it’s a similar plant. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remember to always consult a doctor before trying any sort of health hack you hear about online.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And milk thistle isn’t the only trending supplement that’s got experts rolling their eyes — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/24/health/popular-supplement-might-be-worthless-new-study-finds/"&gt;creatine&lt;/a&gt;, used by gym goers to help increase muscle mass and boost performance, is in the spotlight with some calling it useless.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve shown that taking 5 grams of creatine supplement per day does not make any difference to the amount of lean muscle mass people put on while resistance training,” said senior study author Mandy Hagstrom, from the University of New South Wales School of Health Sciences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, chin hairs aren’t limited to post-menopausal women. Women of reproductive age get facial hair, too, and Kausel said that if this happens, you may want to see your doctor. “Having chin hair might mean that your androgens (male hormones) are high,” she said. “High androgens come from either the ovaries (polycystic ovarian syndrome, or PCOS, being the most common cause) or, much less frequently, the adrenal glands.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCOS is a &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-signs_l_633d8874e4b04cf8f368e393" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7730375"&gt;common and treatable condition&lt;/a&gt; caused by cysts in the ovaries that overproduce androgens, so a person’s cycle, ovulation, and fertility can be impaired, Kausel said. “You may have other issues, too, that come from having high androgens, such as acne, hair loss, and hirsutism. PCOS can also have metabolic manifestations with weight gain, insulin resistance, and a high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a hereditary condition, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, that can have a late onset and affect facial hair growth, Green said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another condition that can cause sudden hair growth is Cushing’s disease, where the body produces too much cortisol, leading to higher levels of androgen,” she said. “Cushing’s disease is also associated with weight gain, headaches, and blood sugar issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long story short: If you’re pre-menopausal and you develop facial hair, especially if it comes on suddenly, see your doctor for a diagnosis and treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do about hair on your chin &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some of us are happy to decorate our chin hair with beads, others might want to get rid of it. Luckily, Green said, there’s a lot you can do if that’s the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/laser-hair-removal" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7730375"&gt;Laser hair removal&lt;/a&gt; is a convenient option to clear out unwanted excess hair,” Green said. “The laser emits a specific wavelength that targets the hair follicle’s pigment or melanin. With current advancements in technology, lasers can safely treat all skin tones and hair colors except gray and white, which do not contain melanin for the laser to detect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, “Electrolysis is a great option for permanent hair removal that works for gray and white hairs,” she noted. “During electrolysis, an electric current is delivered to the bottom of the follicle, destroying the root and damaging the follicle to prevent hair growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A physician could also prescribe anti-androgenic medication like &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/spironolactone" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7730375"&gt;spironolactone&lt;/a&gt; to target the excess androgens and prevent further chin or other unusual hair growth, Green said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over-the-counter depilatory creams can be used at home to dissolve the hair, too, but these products tend to be irritating and can even burn the skin if not used properly,” she said. “There are prescription eflornithine creams that work to reduce hair growth, and this cream is a good option for unwanted hair in a small, target area.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, while you may be tempted to pluck your chin hairs, Green strongly advises against that. “Plucking using a tweezer is not the preferred method of hair removal, as it can damage the skin and cause ingrown hairs and folliculitis,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New, long chin hairs can be annoying, but they’re often not cause for concern. And if they’re really bothering you, there’s a lot you can do to address them ― so don’t be afraid to chat with your doctor or dermatologist about any hair growth concerns you might have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-get-chin-hairs-get-older_l_645ed358e4b0c10612ebb90c" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7730375"&gt;HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Are you aware of the growing links between the bacteria in our mouths and the risks of colon, breast, pancreatic, and lung cancer? How about dental links with Alzheimer’s disease, pneumonia, inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and strokes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the necessary evils of scientific inquiry is the need to break massive systems down into component parts and categories. In medicine this leads to small fiefdoms controlled by the likes of cardiologists, pulmonologists, and even neuropsychopharmacologists. Primary care docs like me think we practice at the crossroads of all specialities, and indeed we do in many ways. But when studies come out bridging medicine, dentistry, and personal hygiene — it makes us realize how incredibly complex the universe within really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m guessing you already knew about dental problems being linked to heart disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;But there is so much more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; First some background. Next some studies. Then some useful, actionable stuff we can recommit to in terms of dental health, diet, and diligent hygiene. I’ll even get a little crazy and reference a previous post I wrote about how to avoid or reduce the microplastics and PFAS released with brushing and flossing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say don’t look a gift horse in the mouth. But it turns out that we medical doctors should be giving the gift of an oral examination and education to our patients much more thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And educating ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mouth-body continuum: how oral health impacts our overall health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part I: The emerging link between oral bacteria and colorectal cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I happened upon a study recently that triggered this whole post. It dove deeply into&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;some fascinating research uncovering connections between our oral microbiome and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. I will include links to this study and all other references used to write this post soon in the comments section… but I’m writing this offline while flying in a plane and hyperlinks are presently a pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the sum of the evidence is becoming increasingly compelling: the trillions of microbes inhabiting our mouths aren't just passive residents—they play an active role in either promoting or protecting against one of the most common cancers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bacterial villains in our mouths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several oral bacterial species have been identified as potential drivers of colorectal carcinogenesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fusobacterium nucleatum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; has emerged as a major player, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;found in 30-50% of colorectal tumors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recent research has identified a specific subtype called Fna C2 that appears particularly concerning. This bacterial strain:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Survives the harsh acidic environment of the stomach&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Activates growth-promoting signals in colon cells&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Produces compounds that suppress the local microenvironment immune system&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Increases oxidative stress and DNA damage via reactive oxygen species released&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Increases adenoma/precancerous lesion formation by 2.5 times compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streptococcal species&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; commonly found in the mouth, including S. anginosus and S. gallolyticus, also appear to play potentially harmful roles by:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Producing enzymes that break down protective tissue barriers in the colon&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Activating inflammatory pathways that create a tumor-friendly environment&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Metabolizing dietary nitrates into carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevotella intermedia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; contributes to the problem by helping cancer cells hide from the immune system, inducing expression of PD-L1, a protein that acts like an "invisibility cloak" for tumor cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective bacterial allies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some oral and gut microbes appear to protect against colorectal cancer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lachnospiraceae family bacteria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; produce butyrate, a compound that promotes colon health by inducing the death of cancerous cells and competing with harmful species like F. nucleatum for space on the colon lining.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fusobacterium &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;periodonticum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, unlike its troublesome cousin F. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;nucleatum &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;mentioned above, actually helps regulate inflammation. It promotes the development of regulatory T-cells that keep the immune system balanced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transmission routes: how oral bacteria reach the colon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might wonder how bacteria from your mouth make their way to your large intestine. There are several routes, including the most obvious:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swallowing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: We swallow at least 150 billion oral bacterial cells every day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bloodstream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Routine activities like chewing or dental procedures can allow bacteria to enter the bloodstream, though it’s a tricky maze to end up in the colon from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biofilm formation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Once in the colon, oral bacteria can form resilient communities that are difficult to eliminate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part II: The broader oral-systemic health connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That colorectal cancer connection is just one example of how oral health impacts systemic health. As we zoom out to look at the bigger picture, the evidence for oral-systemic links becomes even more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardiovascular disease risk reduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor oral health, particularly periodontal disease, shows strong associations with cardiovascular conditions through multiple mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Each additional regular daily brushing session reported reduces cardiovascular event risk by 9%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combined hygiene practices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Brushing twice daily plus regular flossing lowers cardiovascular mortality risk by 51%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Periodontal therapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: has been shown to reduce inflammatory markers like CRP by 0.5 mg/L and fibrinogen by 0.14 g/L. In other studies, such reductions of biomarkers have been to 15-20% lower CVD risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For patients already diagnosed with coronary artery disease, intensive oral hygiene has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality risk by up to 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stroke prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recent research has identified a particularly striking connection between &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;flossing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; and stroke risk:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Flossing at least once weekly is linked to a 22% lower risk of ischemic stroke&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;44% lower risk of cardioembolic stroke&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;12% lower risk of atrial fibrillation&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diabetes management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between diabetes and oral health is bidirectional:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Periodontal treatment can improve HbA1c levels by 0.8% in diabetic patients (p&amp;lt;0.01). That’s like adding another medicine, or losing significant weight.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Oral health coaching reduced HbA1c twice as effectively as standard care (0.8% vs 0.4%) in one study (again, will post links in the comments when I’m settled!)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Conversely, uncontrolled diabetes worsens periodontal disease, creating a potentially dangerous cycle&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pneumonia/respiratory protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oral hygiene plays a significant role in respiratory health, too:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This would be particularly important for vulnerable populations like the elderly or immunocompromised who are at higher risk of pneumonia. As I wrote this section on the plane I actually aspirated some water down the wrong pipe, unleashing a coughing fit. Other passengers may have slightly regretted that they chose not to wear a mask as I struggled to stop hacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No worries. I had one on of course. Source controlled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurological risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s always cool to find little tricks that might help preserve our brains. As I close in upon a half century of existence, I understand how important mental faculties are to a meaningful good health span. I’ll be getting that shingles vaccine because it prevents shingles, and might just reduce our risk of dementia! So too with good dental health it would seem. Systematic reviews identify strong associations between:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer associations beyond the colon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that discussion of Fusobacterium associations with higher risk of incident and more aggressive colon cancer? Well, meta-analyses confirm elevated risks for several other cancers with poor oral health. Here’s a sample, but I think there are almost certainly more. And while correlation does not always equal causation, consistent correlation does deserve our attention and further study:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer: 56% increase with periodontal disease&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer: 43% higher incidence in edentulous patients&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer: 22% risk elevation with periodontitis&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammatory conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes associations with treatment can allow us to retrofit more evidence of links between oral and systemic health. Periodontal therapy demonstrates significant benefits for inflammatory conditions, including;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part III: Practical steps to reduce our risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the extensive evidence (of admittedly varying rigor) linking oral health to systemic disease risk, what practical steps can we take to protect ourselves? Here’s the obvious, and the overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize oral hygiene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s 12:41 AM. You have to be up in about six hours and 19 minutes to start the morning fire drill. You’re so damn tired that the idea of brushing well and flossing properly looms larger than a Sisyphean rock candy mountain. But somehow you heroically raise that heavy brush to your mouth. You wrap the floss around your finger like a tourniquet and get down to the final business of a very long day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence clearly shows that consistent oral hygiene practices are worth the tedious effort. Here is a sort-of-ranked list of measures that will reduce medical illnesses associated with poor oral hygiene, even as they primarily care for our teeth and gums:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily Brushing with Fluoride Toothpaste&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Brushing twice daily with fluoride toothpaste is the cornerstone of oral hygiene, reducing plaque, bacteria, and inflammation. Recall that each additional daily brushing session reduces cardiovascular event risk by 9% and improves overall oral health significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget that other big number, too. Brushing twice daily plus regular flossing was associated with a 51% reduction in cardiovascular mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily Flossing or Interdental Cleaning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Flossing reduces risks of systemic diseases like ischemic stroke by 22% and cardioembolic stroke by 44%, as it removes bacteria and debris from between teeth that brushing cannot reach.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Approximately 37% of Americans report flossing once weekly, while nearly 32% admit they don't floss at all.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routine Professional Dental Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Periodontal Therapy for Gum Disease Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthy Diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A diet like the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Mediterranean diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, rich in antioxidants, Omega-3 fatty acids, and fiber supports gum health and reduces systemic inflammation, lowering risks of periodontal disease and associated conditions like cardiovascular disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Consuming at least 30 grams daily can double the abundance of protective Lachnospiraceae bacteria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; intake reduces &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;butyrate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;production, enabling &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Streptococcus &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;overgrowth which was linked with CRC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polyphenol-rich foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Pomegranates, berries, and green tea contain compounds that inhibit harmful bacterial biofilms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omega-3s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Fish, nuts, seeds, etc have been shown to help reduce bacterial adhesion to colonic mucosa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit red meat and saturated fats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: These foods can enhance the virulence of cancer-associated bacteria. Specifically, red meat-derived heme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;iron upregulates &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;fadA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; virulence gene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturated fats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; increase secondary bile acids (e.g., deoxycholic acid), which promote &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prevotella &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;species-driven inflammation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding Tobacco Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouthwash Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;While mouthwash can help reduce bacterial load, its impact on systemic disease prevention seems to be less significant compared to mechanical cleaning methods like brushing and flossing from what I could find.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, I did find one study that used a mouthwash with 0.2% chlorhexidine at least 3 times weekly, and found an associated decrease in colorectal cancer incidence over 10 years (19% relative risk reduction). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addendum: a friend who is a dentist added this bit via email that I thought I should share: “This was a really great article. Chlorhexidine rinses shouldn’t be used longer than 2 weeks though bc it will stain teeth brown. There is an also a lot of promising research coming out in the dental community on the positive oral and systemic effects of Xylitol.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addendum re: xylitol. A really quick online search provides food for thought. “Xylitol has been shown in clinical studies to reduce dental caries by inhibiting the growth of Streptococcus mutans bacteria and decreasing plaque formation. Research indicates xylitol can help prevent acute otitis media (middle ear infections) when delivered through gum or lozenges. Some preliminary studies suggest xylitol may positively impact bone density and gut health, though more research is needed to confirm these systemic benefits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.​​“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most mouthwashes contain alcohol, which is less than ideal for mucosal surfaces inside the mouth. That alcohol &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;burn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; is causing a little superficial damage each time. They do make zero alcohol mouthwash, and I’m pretty sure my dentist recommends that instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinking Fluoridated Water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Techniques and tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mccormickmd.substack.com/p/fake-plastic-humans" target="_blank"&gt;Overlooked ideas about brushing, flossing, swishing and spitting can be further reviewed in this post I wrote a while back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. I never really considered the micro- and nanoplastics that brushing with nylon bristles surely creates, nor the forever chemical PFAS that help many brands of dental floss slip in between your teeth. I’m loyal to one brand of floss that avoids all these problems, and cuts down on the billions of miles of plastic floss we unravel into oblivion each year on planet Earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I still refuse to use horse hair toothbrushes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We already knew that good oral health is tied to good cardiovascular health, but increasingly we are finding it does not end there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brushing, flossing, probably some mouth wash, regular dental care, dental therapies when needed, healthy diets that minimize junk and refined carbs/sugars while emphasizing fiber and nutrients, and I wager reducing microplastics and PFAS in our gums and beyond should all combine to reduce our risks of systemic diseases ranging from colon cancer to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kind of makes you want to go brush your teeth. Now. Doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take good care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And floss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Floss😁&lt;/p&gt;
