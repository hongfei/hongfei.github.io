They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The US Environmental Protection Agency has found no level of exposure to Pfos or Pfoa, two of the most common Pfas compounds, in drinking water is safe. They have a half-life in human blood of anywhere from two to five years, by most estimates. That means the body expels half the amount of the chemical that is in blood during that period. Depending on blood levels, it can take decades to fully expel Pfas naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Though the findings represent the first time gut microbes have been found to remove Pfas, they have been found to alleviate the impacts of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2023/nov/27/probiotics-plastics-fermented-food-bacteria-stomach-benefit" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;other contaminants&lt;/a&gt;, such as microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers didn’t set out to determine if the gut bacteria expelled Pfas specifically, but instead looked at a suite of 42 common food contaminants. No Pfas limits for food exist in the US, but there is broad consensus that it is among the main exposure routes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some microbes performed well in expelling Pfas, so the study’s authors zoomed in on those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The authors introduced nine of a family of bacterial species into the guts of mice to humanize the mouse microbiome – the bacteria rapidly accumulated to absorb Pfas eaten by the mice, and the chemicals were then excreted in feces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The bacteria seem to absorb the chemical, then use a “pump” mechanism that pushes toxins from the cells and aids in excretion, the authors wrote. The mechanism by which the chemicals are pulled into the cell is not yet understood, Lindell said, but she suspects there may be a similar pump. These are developed by microbes to expel other contaminants, drugs or antibiotics, Lindell added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Detox Your Kitchen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"detox-your-kitchen","successDescription":"A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries."}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The body more efficiently discharges short-chain Pfas through urine because the compounds are generally water-soluble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Among the most common and dangerous long chains are Pfoa and Pfna, which the microbes expelled at rates of up to 58% and 74%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lindell and other study leaders have started a company, Cambiotics, that will develop a probiotic based on their findings. They are planning to follow up the research with a human study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;However, Lindell stressed that the probiotic would not solve the broader Pfas crisis: “This should not be used as an excuse to downplay other sustainable solutions or to not address the bigger Pfas problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 12:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNWVh4NXNPVEMxa2xzTWh1cUM4ZlZMeERmLUJZNFVXXzBrdEV5NmlxQ1d3MTRyMGdJbVF4Nlg1Y19QZUR2MUdyWlV3TDVULW1VbDlHdmxscWNha0h4Y0d2Q0RKa0hjMXVmSXJLSTc0T3VMdU4zZVpVcEljYkFibTA5UFBER2dEc2t1X3lhcnV1cFc</guid></item><item><title>这4种常见的食物类型可能会让你闻起来很难闻，专家警告- AOL.com | These 4 common food types could make you smell bad, experts caution -

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic inflammation can increase the risk of chronic illnesses like heart disease, diabetes and cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A nutritious diet, exercise and mindfulness may protect against inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy morning habits like yoga or a quiet cup of coffee or tea may help fight inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Starting your day on the right foot sets the tone for the rest of your day. So, why not begin by helping your body fight off inflammation? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We hear a lot about the negative effects of inflammation, but it can be helpful to know that not all inflammation is bad. Acute inflammation is a short-lived natural response our body has to injury or illness. That’s a good thing. Chronic inflammation, however, is prolonged and can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce our body’s ability to repair&lt;/a&gt; and heal, leading to increased risk of conditions like diabetes, heart disease and cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, anything you can do to prevent it may keep you healthier in the long run. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These six inflammation-fighting morning habits can get you going.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-drink-water"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Drink Water &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your body loses fluids while you sleep, so in the morning, you naturally wake up a touch dehydrated. Starting your day with some water is a good choice for many reasons. Hydration is linked with longevity, reduced risk of chronic illness and general health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If those reasons aren’t enough to start your day with a cup of water, dehydration is tied to higher levels of inflammation in the body. Chronic dehydration may even lead to “inflammageing,” or chronic inflammation that happens as we age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, starting your day with a glass of water is free. So, this is one anti-inflammatory habit that should be easy to start if you’re not doing it already.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-move-your-body-gently"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Move Your Body Gently  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your dog and cat are onto something when they take a big stretch as they roll out of bed in the morning. But getting some gentle morning movement shouldn’t be reserved just for our furry friends. Regular exercise helps &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-avoid-for-chronic-inflammation-8644317" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce your risk for chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As good for you as physical activity is, intense exercise can increase inflammatory markers in the short term. While exercise’s overall benefits outweigh any downsides, starting your day with some gentle movement may be especially beneficial if your goal is reducing inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research has found that moderate and lighter movement is not tied to the same increases in inflammatory markers in the body as intense exercise. That’s where stretching comes in. Its benefits go beyond just feeling good. Studies show that limbering up can help reduce inflammatory markers throughout your body, as well as locally in the tissues you are stretching.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, that’s not the only way to gently move your body. A stroll around the block or an easy yoga session works, too.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-get-some-morning-light"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Get Some Morning Light  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may have heard that getting outside in the morning light can help you sleep better at night. That’s because a.m. sunshine helps regulate your body’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-1-afternoon-habit-to-start-for-better-sleep-11756992" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;, which strongly influences your sleep-and-wake cycle. This, in turn, helps you wake up more easily in the morning and fall asleep at night. But your circadian rhythm isn’t just about sleep. It is also closely tied to your immune system and to inflammation. Conversely, lack of daylight may send your circadian rhythm into an inflammatory tailspin. One study found that shift workers with misaligned circadian rhythms had higher levels of C-reactive protein, or CRP, a marker of systemic inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, getting some rays helps your body make vitamin D, which is known for its anti-inflammatory effects. Research has found that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D’s ability to help reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; may be particularly impactful in reducing the risk of metabolic, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-eat-some-berries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Eat Some Berries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The deep purples, vibrant reds and rich blues that color our favorite berries are indicators of just how loaded these tiny fruits are with antioxidants. In particular, berries are rich in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;phenolic compounds&lt;/a&gt;, like anthocyanins and flavonols, which work to reduce inflammation in the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berries are also delicious. When they’re in season, load up on colorful, fresh berries. When you can’t find fresh berries, frozen berries are just as good for you and often more affordable and convenient. Try them paired with protein-rich strained (Greek-style) yogurt or whir them into a smoothie for a tasty breakfast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-make-time-for-mindfulness"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Make Time for Mindfulness &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stress is a sneaky trigger for inflammation. Why? When you’re stressed, your body goes into “fight or flight” mode, stimulating the release of stress hormones like cortisol. That may have been helpful back in the days when we had to be ready to outrun a saber-tooth tiger at a moment’s notice. Today, it’s still humming behind the scenes when that surprise 9 a.m. meeting suddenly drops on your calendar. Once in a while, that’s no big deal. Yet, being constantly stressed can also lead to inflammation in your brain and body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To help keep stress and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902105/stress-causing-inflammation-what-you-can-do-about-it/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress-related inflammation&lt;/a&gt; at bay, carve out a little time for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7903638/science-backed-ways-to-be-happier-amp-reduce-stress-that-are-easy-and-free/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;mindfulness exercises&lt;/a&gt; like deep breathing or body scans, or try a morning meditation. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-drink-coffee-or-tea"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Drink Coffee or Tea  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your morning cup of joe or tea is more than just a nice, calming ritual that kicks off your day with a caffeine boost. Coffee and tea are jammed with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/80991/10-ways-to-reduce-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation-busting antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;. Take green tea, for example. It’s packed with antioxidants, like EGCG (epigallocatechin-3-gallate), which research has found helps lower inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Black tea is also full of antioxidants shown to calm inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But don’t turn your nose up at coffee, especially if that's your morning drink of choice. Coffee contains more polyphenols than green tea, plus other antioxidants that help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054507/best-antioxidant-rich-anti-inflammatory-fruits/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; and inflammation in your body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-reduce-inflammation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Reduce Inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Morning is an ideal opportunity to get a jump start on fighting inflammation. But why stop there? These strategies can help you combat inflammation throughout the day and even at night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Enough Sleep: &lt;/strong&gt;While this isn’t necessarily a morning habit, a good night’s sleep is crucial for reducing inflammation. Research has found that inconsistent sleep is tied with raised inflammatory markers, particularly for women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Taking the time to wind down at night with a relaxing evening routine may help you get the zzz’s you need to fend off chronic inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active Throughout the Day: &lt;/strong&gt;Exercise is one of the best things you can do for your body, including fighting off chronic inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, try to move your body regularly throughout the day. Stay moving by taking frequent walk breaks, having a kitchen dance party or getting more structured exercise at any time of day. A good goal is 150 minutes of moderate activity per week, plus two weekly strength-training sessions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Added Sugars: &lt;/strong&gt;While there are plenty of anti-inflammatory foods to include in your diet, there are also some foods to limit. Like added sugars, which have been linked to increased inflammatory markers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; No need to stress if you have some sweets occasionally (remember, stress and inflammation go hand in hand). Just do your best to intentionally choose where you are getting sweetness in your diet. That means checking the ingredient list when buying foods like breads, crackers, yogurts and sauces to make sure they don’t contain too much added sugar. And when you do eat sweet foods, choose smaller portions of those that satisfy your sweet tooth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

So, why not get started in the morning? Starting your day with a glass of water, a relaxing cup of coffee or tea, a bowl of fresh berries, and some gentle stretching, deep breathing, yoga or an outdoor walk in the sun are all easy—and enjoyable—healthy habits you can add to your morning to keep inflammation at bay. In addition to fighting inflammation, they’ll benefit your overall health in other ways, too. That means they do double duty in keeping your body in tip-top shape. Try adding all, or most, of these to your morning. Then, keep the momentum going throughout the day with plenty of colorful foods, hydrating beverages and regular movement.&lt;br&gt;

Nearly 20 years ago a team led by Hiroshi Nose and other researchers from Japan published a study that found that middle-aged and older people who did &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025619611613037" target="_blank"&gt;high-intensity interval walking&lt;/a&gt; had lower blood pressure, stronger thigh muscles, and better aerobic capacity than walkers the same age who kept a more moderate, continuous pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="42U5VIGI6FBGDFNF63DYBEEVQM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the study, the volunteers did three minutes of fast walking followed by three minutes at a slower pace, for 30 minutes per day at least four days per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CQKHFOA2WZBQTOKYZFPOI5N3YE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“One of the most surprising findings was that IWT markedly increased physical fitness and decreased blood pressure after the 5-month intervention whereas these improvements were not observed in the moderate-intensity continuous walking group,” said &lt;a href="https://www.shinshu-u.ac.jp/institution/ibs/english/department/bsi.html" target="_blank"&gt;Shizue Masuki&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher on the team and professor at Shinshu University Graduate School of Medicine in Matsumoto.

It puts healthy stress on the heart, which increases its capacity to function better and decreases resting blood pressure,” said &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" target="_blank"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, general and bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, Calif. “Once you’re settled down from that increase, over time, your blood pressure improves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5JOVCGDPANDZVB2P6HDMYB77ZE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Masuki said that additional studies by her team have also shown that the walking technique has benefits for &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/20/sleep-banking-alertness-performance/" target="_blank"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/31/exercise-walking-brain-health/" target="_blank"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ND3YL27VAZFXPLH2DZXCIHIQ3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Mindful walking, especially in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/nature-health-maps-neighborhood-city/" target="_blank"&gt;green space&lt;/a&gt;, has been shown to lower blood pressure, reduce cortisol, improve focus and sleep, and help regulate mood,” said&lt;a href="https://www.uchealth.com/en/provider-profiles/walker-barbara-1225431273" target="_blank"&gt; Barbara Walker&lt;/a&gt;, an integrative health and performance psychologist at University of Cincinnati Health. “When paired with an interval walking approach, it becomes even more psychologically impactful: blending the benefits of nature exposure with the motivational structure of achievable physical goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="BAIB6F33WBFQZGAB5SJOPJHTHU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="BAIB6F33WBFQZGAB5SJOPJHTHU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;How hard is interval walking training?&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LIHELUZM7ZDI7OTBD5PZO4XT3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Of course, the best workout is the one you’ll actually do. And you might wonder, if fast walking is so great, why not just do that for 30 minutes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AU7FLJTTRNFBPE2TSCUROIC7AA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;IWT seems to be more doable than walking at an intense pace the entire time, said Masuki. Her research team instructed one group of their middle-aged and older subjects to walk continuously at the high intensity level for 30 minutes a day. “However, no one completed the program, and they complained that the program was too boring and too difficult,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B6Z23QRH2RFGVPOD3SM3C3CDAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most studies have found about 60 to 90 percent of people can achieve the goals of IWT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QRECCNHPOJDLXFSXYN3SDG5PSI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One factor might be the amount of time it takes. For some, walking goals that require hours of accumulating steps throughout the day might even be discouraging because it takes too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BNFIZKGKFVHEVOQ6JXDB7OWO4Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“While doing 10,000 steps can improve blood pressure, sugar control and even lipid levels, doing interval walking for a shorter time can do the same benefits and more,” said &lt;a href="https://www.fratellonemedical.com/meet-dr-fratellone" target="_blank"&gt;Patrick Fratellone&lt;/a&gt;, a preventative cardiologist in New York City and Fairfield, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="IL5U5GPJD5AYZP7U5ZN6CBXETU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-ieHKbcq-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="IL5U5GPJD5AYZP7U5ZN6CBXETU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;How to try interval walking&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="LFBOARDYMVAYTK7W6AOLTCY5FM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-ifBuccc-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="LFBOARDYMVAYTK7W6AOLTCY5FM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Start slowly and carefully&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LQHARNS53RCMTFKHHGEBVCRFTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;All of our experts shared a common piece of advice — start slow. You don’t have to jump into 30-minute &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/01/02/fartlek-interval-training-exercise/" target="_blank"&gt;interval sessions&lt;/a&gt; right away. Ali said even 15 minutes twice per day is still beneficial, and you can still try those intervals within that. Work up to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended amount of exercise&lt;/a&gt; for adults in the U.S. — 150 minutes of physical activity each week, for example, by doing 30 minutes at a time, 5 days per week. Adding in two days of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/29/minimum-weight-training-per-week/" target="_blank"&gt;muscle-strengthening activity &lt;/a&gt;would help meet the federal guidelines for exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2KGFTGKTHFA63GY5B2VBLIS77Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As always, talk to your doctor before beginning any new exercise program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CA4FS5PVZJBMROCSB7LO33Y6WM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We shouldn’t take a previously sedentary person and put them in a high-intensity interval training program,” said &lt;a href="https://anchorcincy.com/anchor-our-team/sarah-crawford/" target="_blank"&gt;Sarah Crawford&lt;/a&gt;, a physical therapist in Cincinnati. “That’s why practices like mine stay in business.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="GFWAKKTY5NCIHDH2KCUNFKZSRA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="GFWAKKTY5NCIHDH2KCUNFKZSRA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Use unofficial metrics&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EI5LXIIU7NG55FRV75VUKIP3GA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the 2007 study, the volunteers aimed to do three minutes of walking at 70% of their peak aerobic capacity or VO2 max, which is a measure of the maximum amount of oxygen the body can process, followed by three minutes at 40% of their peak aerobic capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3N6GNKO2AZCYFEBKNSIX6G6EDQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While some fitness trackers will give you this number, a good rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t really be able to talk for the whole three “fast” minutes in IWT, Crawford said.

This essentially means that Alzheimer's is a form of dementia, so dementia cannot be a form of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;She continued: "Okay, so dementia is the umbrella term, whereby there are lots of dementia syndromes that sit underneath. So you have Alzheimer's disease, you have vascular dementia, you have mixed dementia, you have Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="BoxStyles_box-container__Qk3WH BoxStyles_non-commercial__aiWwo" data-testid="non-commercial-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;"You have frontotemporal dementia, you have Lewy Body dementia, the Korsakoff's dementia. So, there are lots of different dementia syndromes. They all fit underneath the term 'dementia'. So, Alzheimer's is a type of dementia.

&lt;p&gt;I feel most comfortable falling asleep on my stomach, despite the fact that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleeping-positions/sleeping-on-stomach" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleeping-positions/sleeping-on-stomach" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt; say that belly sleeping can lead to aches and pains in the back and neck. The problem is, that I find it difficult to drop off on my side or back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having recently turned 30, I’m now paying the price for decades of belly sleeping. I’m waking up with lower back pain and I have started feeling a loss of spinal mobility throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it hurts to move in a certain way, I’ve been consciously (and subconsciously) avoiding those movements, which means I’m now less flexible when I do finally try to do them. For example, I’ve found myself less able to pick up items from the floor without squatting down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only thing that helps is a stretch called the seated forward fold but I’ve never done it consistently. But as the pain has increased, I decided to do it every day before going to bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-when-to-do-the-seated-forward-fold"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When to do the seated forward fold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The late timing of the seated forward fold was recommended by April Flood, a physical therapist at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://smithptplus.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://smithptplus.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Smith Physical Therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-person-sxeAJhm5bCK7LwuspCCAKi-NM3eDstmQ2FBA4509d1I9vO8xfHjsgbP" class="slice-container person-wrapper person-sxeAJhm5bCK7LwuspCCAKi-NM3eDstmQ2FBA4509d1I9vO8xfHjsgbP slice-container-person"&gt;&lt;div class="person person--separator"&gt;&lt;div class="person__heading"&gt;&lt;div class="person__name-socials"&gt;&lt;span class="person__name"&gt;April Flood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nav class="button-social-group person__social-buttons" aria-labelledby="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;&lt;p id="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;Social Links Navigation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="button-social   " href="https://smithptplus.com/%20" target="_blank" aria-label="WEBSITE"&gt;&lt;span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"&gt;&lt;svg class="icon-website" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 1000 1000"&gt;&lt;path d="M1000 500A501 501 0 0 0 503 0h-6A501 501 0 0 0 0 500c0 275 223 499 498 500h4a501 501 0 0 0 498-500zM529 936V765h133c-31 90-79 154-133 171zM337 765h134v171c-54-17-101-81-134-171zM61 539h176a899 899 0 0 0 22 167H110a439 439 0 0 1-49-166zM471 64v191H331c31-101 82-173 140-191zm199 191H529V64c58 18 109 90 140 191zm270 226H763c-1-59-7-115-18-167h155a438 438 0 0 1 40 167zm-235 0H529V314h156a857 857 0 0 1 19 167zM471 314v167H296a859 859 0 0 1 19-167h156zM237 481H60a438 438 0 0 1 41-167h154a921 921 0 0 0-18 167zm59 58h175v167H320a837 837 0 0 1-24-166zm233 167V539h175a831 831 0 0 1-24 167H529zm234-166h176a436 436 0 0 1-49 166H741a893 893 0 0 0 22-166zm104-285H731c-20-68-47-126-81-169a443 443 0 0 1 217 169zM350 86c-33 43-61 101-81 169H133A443 443 0 0 1 350 86zM148 765h127c20 59 45 110 75 150a442 442 0 0 1-202-150zm502 150c30-39 56-91 75-150h127a442 442 0 0 1-202 150z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="person__bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flood has a Bachelor’s degree in Biology and a Doctorate in Physical Therapy from Clarke University in Dubuque, Iowa. She has spent her career working in the outpatient orthopedic field, treating a variety of post-operative and non-operative patients to help them return to their desired activity levels and improve their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It gives the muscles a good stretch and gives them the cue to calm down, so when you roll onto your stomach at night they don’t stay tight and guarded,” she says, explaining that ‘muscle guarding’ is when the surrounding muscles tense to protect a muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By stretching in a direction that counteracts the positions your spine has been in all day, you give those muscles a chance to relax so they do not stay tight and tense while you are sleeping.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sxeAJhm5bCK7LwuspCCAKi" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sxeAJhm5bCK7LwuspCCAKi slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And my aches could be caused by more than sleeping. “Even if you don’t experience low back pain during the day, the cumulative effect of prolonged sitting, or prolonged standing can cause pain by the end of the day,” she says because the spine is being impacted all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With nearly everything we do, our spine is working. It is also not uncommon for people, especially hypermobile people, to stand with their knees locked, which causes a forward tilt at our pelvis and then leads to extension of our spine,” she says. “We may not feel it at that moment, but later that night may be when you feel the effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the way I sleep compounds the problem. “When we lie on our stomachs we create further extension of our spine,” says Flood. “Those muscles along our spine, called the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Paraspinal_Muscles" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Paraspinal_Muscles" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;paraspinals&lt;/a&gt;, can get tight.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extend both legs and reach towards the feet with both hands (this is your full seated forward fold).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try to touch your feet if possible but if you can’t, or if it puts a painful strain on the back, then aim for your calves instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold for one minute.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim to reach a little closer to the feet as time goes on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you can reach the feet, aim to bend the elbows and lower the torso closer to the legs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-i-found-after-doing-a-seated-forward-fold-every-day"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What I found after doing a seated forward fold every day &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did the seated forward fold before bed every night for a week—without fail, even when I really couldn’t be bothered. It’s such a simple move that I wasn’t expecting huge results in just seven days. Here’s what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-stretching-progressively-was-very-helpful"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stretching progressively was very helpful&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting with the cross-legged stretch and slowly progressing to the full forward fold helped me to achieve a deeper stretch. Jumping straight in with a full forward fold, both legs extended, was too intense for me and caused discomfort in my lower back and hamstrings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I began by stretching over folded legs, it allowed me to ease down and stretch my muscles more gradually, so that when I did reach the final stretch, it wasn’t uncomfortable. This way I managed to achieve a deeper release in the last pose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-woke-up-pain-free-the-first-morning"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I woke up pain free the first morning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem counterintuitive to stretch before bed instead of first thing when I’m feeling the most pain, but I took Flood’s advice and the timing worked really well for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That first morning, I woke up without a stiff lower back for the first time in months. Instead of my usual creaky clamber out of bed, I sat up without the aches and lifted myself up with ease. The pains and aches didn’t return with the same intensity during the day either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-mobility-improved"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My mobility improved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a week of stretching before bed, I found that not only was I pain free in the mornings, but my mobility improved too. Twisting, reaching and even lifting something above my head might previously have triggered soreness in my lower back, but now I could move without issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not great at sticking to regular stretching, even when it’s helpful, so I’ll aim to do this a few times a week before bed as a preventative measure to keep the lower back pain at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m unlikely to adapt to sleeping on my back or side, so having this simple stretch to counteract any issues is great. And if the aches do return, I’ll know it’s time to increase the regularity with which I do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One food will not make or break your weight loss goals—it's all about variety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foods like dairy, whole grains, potatoes, eggs and popcorn can all be included.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus on healthy cooking methods to enjoy foods with a bad reputation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Certain foods have an unwarranted negative reputation. When people talk about these foods, they use words like “bad” and “weight gain”. But that couldn’t be further from the truth. No single food can cause weight gain or loss. Weight fluctuations occur as a result of your daily diet over time. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a matter of fact, these five “bad” foods may actually help with weight loss. Although the foods on this list can have an unhealthy stigma, they are full of protein and fiber, two nutrients that help facilitate weight loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Believe it or not, many foods you may believe are off-limits can be part of a healthy eating pattern. Here are five “bad” foods that may help you reach your weight loss goals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-full-fat-dairy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Full-Fat Dairy &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You’ve probably seen recommendations to include low-fat dairy in your daily eating pattern, but what about full-fat dairy, like whole milk, cheese or butter? These foods have more calories and fat than their lower-fat counterparts, but research suggests that including full-fat dairy may not affect weight. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research has not found a link between consuming full-fat dairy and weight gain, nor is it associated with an increased risk of obesity in children or adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And although calorie concerns are higher among whole-milk drinkers, most Americans don’t consume the recommended three servings of dairy foods per day in the first place. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another concern about full-fat dairy is that it has more saturated fat than lower-fat versions. For reference, an 8-ounce serving of milk has 4.5 grams of saturated fat as compared to 1.4 grams in 8-ounces of 1% milk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yet, research concludes full-fat dairy consumption does not negatively affect cardiometabolic risk factors or heart disease. In addition, fermented dairy foods, such as full-fat yogurt and cheese, may actually protect against cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-carb-rich-grains"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Carb-Rich Grains  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbohydrate-forward grains, like pasta, bread and rice, are often thought of as “bad” foods that people should restrict. Although these grains are rich in carbohydrates, they can still be part of a healthy weight-loss diet. Research has not found a difference in weight loss results when people who were overweight followed a low-carbohydrate diet instead of a balanced-carbohydrate diet. Rather, the authors claim that the total calorie intake matters more for weight changes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-whole-grain-weight-loss-8387518" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole grain carbs&lt;/a&gt;, like brown rice and quinoa, are rich in fiber, a nutrient that helps regulate appetite and contributes to a healthy weight. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-eggs"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Eggs  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eggs are constantly under the spotlight because they are a cholesterol-containing food. But eating eggs does not directly impact &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8023641/can-you-eat-eggs-if-you-have-high-cholesterol/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; or heart disease risk, and eggs can be a healthy part of a weight loss plan. One large egg has just 70 calories, 5 grams of fat and 6 grams of protein, making it a balanced addition to the diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One review study examined 32 controlled clinical trials and revealed that eating eggs did not significantly affect body weight. The authors attribute these findings to the protein in the egg, which helps increase satiety and fullness.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, studies with calorie restriction and healthy subjects found that whole egg intake actually decreased body mass index (BMI). BMI is a measure that’s often used in health care to determine a person’s body weight category (such as underweight, overweight or obese) and, therefore, chronic disease risk. However, it has limitations and does not account for individual factors that influence one’s health status, such as body composition, ethnicity, race, sex and age.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-potatoes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Potatoes  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This starchy root veggie receives a lot of shade due to its high carb content. But, believe it or not, the type of starch in potatoes can help contribute to weight loss. Potatoes contain resistant starch, a type of carbohydrate that “resists” digestion and controls appetite. One study found that eating potatoes suppressed appetite and reduced short-term food consumption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition, pairing potatoes with a protein-rich food increased satiety and reduced hunger.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So go ahead and fill your potato with plenty of protein-rich foods, like beans, eggs, dairy or chicken, for a weight loss-friendly meal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-popcorn"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Popcorn  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some people may think of popcorn as a “bad” snack food, but it’s a healthy fiber-rich, low-calorie whole grain. One cup of air-popped popcorn has just 30 calories and 1 gram of fiber, making it a crunchy and satisfying low-calorie snack.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Although there isn’t much research on the benefits of popcorn for weight loss, one study compared the short-term satiety from low-fat popcorn with potato chips and found that people who ate popcorn expressed less hunger, more satisfaction and said they ate less food overall.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But, when enjoying popcorn, be mindful of the other added ingredients. Additional flavors, like butter, caramel or chocolate, can add up to a lot of calories and fat that may not align as well with weight loss goals.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although you may think a certain food is “bad” for weight loss, perception doesn’t always match reality. Foods like potatoes, popcorn and eggs can be part of a healthy weight-loss diet. It’s also important to remember that one food cannot make or break your weight loss goals or healthy eating regimen. Think of the diet as a whole and include a variety of whole foods with fiber and protein to keep you full and satisfied.

&lt;p&gt;It is unknown whether the newest COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, also known by the nickname “razor throat” for one of its defining symptoms, is present in Pitkin County as local summer cases increase.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After Colorado confirmed the presence of this variant in the state at the end of last month, Pitkin County Public Health is attempting to track it amid a decline in COVID sample submissions and reduction of COVID-19 funding nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“​​We know that this is a very competitive covid variant,” said Pitkin County Epidemiology Program Administrator Carly Senst, meaning it “evolved for immune evasion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The NB.1.8.1 variant was first identified at the beginning of this year in Asia and then Europe. It has so far been detected in at least 15 U.S. states with a noted high growth rate, meaning it spreads faster and is increasing its prevalence more rapidly than other variants. The World Health Organization has identified it as a “variant of concern.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But despite its higher transmission rate and associated severe sore throat pain, Senst said that genetic breakdowns of this variant in lab studies show there are no indications of higher severity or hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Slaughter, chief growth and marketing officer and community relations for Aspen Valley Health, confirmed this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Pitkin County has seen an uptick in the number of COVID cases in general this summer, but this has not translated into hospitalized patients or severe illness at Aspen Valley Health,” Slaughter said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, Senst remains vigilant since COVID-19 variants always have the potential to change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“COVID will always have the capacity to throw curveballs at us,” she said. “It is a super mutagenic virus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This new variant comes at a time when Pitkin County is on the cusp of seeing a notable increase in COVID-19 presence, something she said was anticipated this summer due to tourism. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment wastewater surveillance data shows Pitkin County is currently experiencing a “steady increase” of cases that she said is likely to continue for at least the next couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We truly are only touching on that beginning of that,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because Pitkin County is considered a “small” county, individual case counts for many reportable conditions, not just COVID, are not publicly released in order to protect the privacy of individual community members, according to Senst.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The only time there is an exception to this is if there is a public health threat, like during the pandemic, or currently, like with the measles,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The best prevention methods continue to be staying up-to-date on COVID-19 vaccinations — while the current vaccine is not specifically formulated for this incoming variant, she confirmed it is still effective — staying home if sick, washing hands frequently, and masking up with a surgical grade mask when symptomatic or if in a higher risk category and frequenting a crowded indoor space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet despite the increase in cases, she said the level of concern in Pitkin County has not yet increased among public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“COVID-19 continues to be at a very similar threat level as last year especially,” Senst said. “But we will continue to watch COVID for that pandemic potential. It will never be just like the flu. COVID-19 continues to cause more severe illness and continues to lead the charge in terms of deaths.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article-tagline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;				&lt;/div&gt;

While these people are probably well-meaning, constantly being in the spotlight during such a personal time can get overwhelming. So, in order to maintain some peace and normalcy, parents may decide to establish some boundaries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As did &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/g6eh69/mil_yelled_no_and_cried_during_gender_reveal/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; couple.

She even forced herself into their gender reveal, which she inevitably dampened with her unacceptable behavior. At a loss, the pregnant woman turned online for some advice on how to deal with the situation that had unfolded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll down to read the full story and a conversation

target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; experts agree that personal space and calmness are essential during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pregnancy is a profound physical, emotional, and psychological transition, and maintaining a sense of autonomy over your body and your choices helps foster a healthy adjustment,” explains licensed clinical psychologist, certified executive coach, and consultant &lt;a href="http://www.drannewelsh.com/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Dr. Anne Welsh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yet something happens when a woman becomes visibly pregnant: her body often becomes treated as public property. People touch her belly without asking, comment on her size, and offer unsolicited advice. These are things they would never do outside of pregnancy. This can leave women feeling exposed, judged, and even invisible as a person apart from the pregnancy. Protecting personal space and peace is one way to affirm, ‘This is still my body, my experience, and my story to tell.'”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Personal space and peace help expecting parents slow down, listen to their bodies, and tune into what they need, whether that’s rest, quiet, or just fewer opinions flying at them,” adds licensed psychotherapist &lt;a href="http://www.aerialcetnar.com/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Dr. Aerial Cetnar&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a big life transition that requires a lot of mental preparation. Feeling grounded and safe matters, and that often starts with having room to breathe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If pregnant women’s personal space is invaded and boundaries are crossed, it may increase stress, which can have negative effects on the mom and baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies have shown that increased stress can increase levels of cortisol for pregnant folks and fetuses. There is a correlation with a higher chance of preterm birth, lowered birth weights, increased risk of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders and other complications,” licensed therapist and perinatal mental health specialist &lt;a href="https://www.elevatetherapyllc.com/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Ashley Fields&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When boundaries are repeatedly crossed, whether physically or emotionally, it can chip away at a woman’s sense of agency and increase stress,” additionally notes Dr. Welsh. “Research, including my own, has shown that this kind of unwanted attention can negatively affect body image during and after pregnancy. It can also contribute to feelings of anxiety, self-consciousness, or even resentment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_6" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When pregnant women’s boundaries are respected, they tend to feel more confident and supported&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="mil-yelled-no-cried-during-gender-reveal-11" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/mil-yelled-no-cried-during-gender-reveal/?image_id=mil-yelled-no-cried-during-gender-reveal-11.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="MIL Reveals Her True Ugly Colors At Grandbaby’s Gender Reveal" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/mil-yelled-no-cried-during-gender-reveal/?media_id=mil-yelled-no-cried-during-gender-reveal-11" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mil-yelled-no-cried-during-gender-reveal-11.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8988139" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mil-yelled-no-cried-during-gender-reveal-11.jpg" alt="Pregnant woman with partner and mother-in-law touching belly during a gender reveal moment at home." title="Pregnant woman with partner and mother-in-law touching belly during a gender reveal moment at home." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/medium-shot-happy-family-expecting-baby_39055672.htm#fromView=search&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;position=37&amp;amp;uuid=ff3735aa-e9d6-4f01-a6af-84027c77ecef&amp;amp;query=pregnant+woman+family" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;freepik (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, when others respect &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/husband-insulting-wife-mother-in-law/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;pregnant women’s&lt;/a&gt; boundaries, they tend to feel more confident and supported, which is beneficial for their mental health and adjustment to motherhood, says Dr. Welsh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Setting the stage with good boundaries, self-care, and strategies for promoting mental health during pregnancy can act as protective factors for maternal mental health. This is important because the number 1 complication of pregnancy, often untreated, is perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs),” notes Fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Welsh suggests that setting boundaries could mean simply offering kind but firm statements, like ‘&lt;em&gt;We appreciate your concern, but we’re figuring out what works for us’&lt;/em&gt; or ‘&lt;em&gt;I’d rather not talk about my body or our plans right now.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can also help to proactively share what you do welcome,” she adds. “For example, &lt;em&gt;“We’re happy to talk about names once we’ve decided”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“Please check before posting photos of me.”&lt;/em&gt; Framing your needs positively and as part of taking good care of yourself and the baby, can help family hear it as loving rather than rejecting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the set boundaries aren’t respected, Dr. Cetnar advises repeating them as needed without over-explaining. “Some people may not like it, but your comfort and mental health matter more than keeping everyone happy. If someone keeps pushing, consider limiting your time with them overall or asking someone else to help reinforce boundaries. If they persist, it may be helpful to share how the lack of respect is making you feel and request more space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Dr. Welsh says that it’s important to keep in mind that motherhood, beginning with pregnancy, is deeply personal and unique and what may work for one may not work for another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A woman’s choices about her body, her family, and her work are hers alone. My advice to others: assume she’s doing her best at two really hard things: growing a baby and growing into motherhood. Let her take the lead on what kind of attention and support she wants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Commenters were appalled by MIL ruining such a special time for the parents&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_7" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="mil-yelled-no-cried-during-gender-reveal-2" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/mil-yelled-no-cried-during-gender-reveal/?image_id=mil-yelled-no-cried-during-gender-reveal-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="MIL Reveals Her True Ugly Colors At Grandbaby’s Gender Reveal" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/mil-yelled-no-cried-during-gender-reveal/?media_id=mil-yelled-no-cried-during-gender-reveal-2" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mil-yelled-no-cried-during-gender-reveal-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8978403" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mil-yelled-no-cried-during-gender-reveal-2.jpg" alt="Text conversation about a chaotic mother-in-law screaming at a gender reveal and causing family drama." title="Text conversation about a chaotic mother-in-law screaming at a gender reveal and causing family drama." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_8" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_9" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_10" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_11" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_12" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_13" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_14" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_15" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Others also shared similar stories&lt;/h3&gt;

The birds in Central Park, the kids laughing in the spray of water from open fire hydrants, the $20 sandwich you got at the good deli to eat on a picnic blanket along the waterfront.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s also hotter than the inside of a dog’s mouth. I don’t want to be dramatic, but I believe that moving about an ever-warming subtropical New York City in the summer without the promise of a Hamptons escape on the weekends is the making for a Les Mis Part Deux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As I walk to work, sweat lining my upper lip and a triangle of space above my eyebrows, I think to myself, well, it could be worse. I could be having a panic attack, which, before medicine, was a common occurrence for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But then it hits - the very thing helping me keep my sanity in a crowded subway car is also the thing making me feel like I've been trapped in sauna fully clothed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For about a decade, I've taken an SSRI - a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor - to help with my anxiety and depressive episodes. Medications in this class include Zoloft and Prozac and among the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12226335/Heatwave-health-warning-millions-antidepressants-little-known-agonising-effect.html"&gt;laundry list of side effects&lt;/a&gt;, which include gastrointestinal issues, sexual dysfunction, and insomnia, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-5352377/Rare-condition-leaves-woman-uncontrollably-SWEATING.html"&gt;is hyperhidrosis&lt;/a&gt; – or excessive sweating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the roughly 32 million Americans take an antidepressant, around 21 percent - 6.7 million people - experience this less-than-ideal side effect, according to the International Hyperhidrosis Society. The excessive dampness occurs because SSRIs disrupt the body's internal temperature gauge, triggering excessive - and sometimes unnecessary - sweating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Angela Downey, a family physician and host of the Codependent Doctor Podcast, told me that these medications impact the hypothalamus, also known as the brain’s thermostat, ‘which affects how your body regulates your body temperature and sweat production.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘Think of serotonin like an orchestra conductor who has suddenly turned up the volume on your internal HVAC system. It will sometimes overcorrect and can lead to unexpected sweating, especially at night or in warm weather.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Me in the sweltering New York City summer featuring my trusty battery-powered fan that I take on the subway (and everywhere else)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What a trade-off. I don’t have crippling panic attacks or a dark cloud of gloom hanging over me, but after 10 minutes of walking down 8th Avenue, I look like I just crawled out of the East River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excessive sweating or hyperhidrosis is a relatively common side effect of SSRIs and another class of drugs similar to SSRIs that I've also taken called serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which include Effexor and Cymbalta, according to Dr Olalekan Otulana, a general practitioner and addiction medicine specialist in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SSRIs allow serotonin - the 'happy hormone' to remain available in the brain’s synapses for longer before being reabsorbed, leaving more of the feel-good neurochemical around to improve mood and alleviate anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SNRIs block the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine - a hormone that regulates the intensity of some emotions - increasing levels of both neurotransmitters to improve mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told me that these drugs stimulate the body’s temperature regulation center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This ‘can lead to the body perceiving that it is warmer than it is, triggering the sweat glands to produce more perspiration as a cooling response.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hypothalamus is the body’s thermostat, and the serotonin molecules there contain receptors that, when stimulated by an SNRI or an SSRI, can lower body temperature by promoting heat loss, including sweating profusely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The graph shows antidepressant use in women, men, and both sexes together over the past 30 days in the US from 2009 to 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SSRIs flood the brain with serotonin, disrupting the hypothalamus’s ability to interpret temperature cues. It takes the influx of serotonin as a signal to start sweating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And when you add norepinephrine in SNRIs to the mix, the hypothalamus gets a double hit of dysregulation and a direct impact on sweat glands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ashwini Nadkarni, a board-certified psychiatrist at Mass General Brigham and Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, told me: ‘To deal with this, people can discuss options with their treating physician,’ including switching to an antidepressant less likely to cause sweating, such as Vortioxetine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Non-pharmacological strategies include wearing loose attire with breathable fabrics, keeping cool with a fan, and staying hydrated during the day,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I have tried several different SSRIs and SNRIs in my long career in mental illness, and was never warned about hyperhidrosis. Psychiatrists were quick to warn a high-school-age me &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13448013/fda-sued-antidepressants-ssri-sexual-effects.html"&gt;about low libido&lt;/a&gt;, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Otulana added: ‘People often notice this side effect more in the summer as their baseline sweating due to heat is already higher. And the drug effect amplifies this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘For some, it can be quite distressing, especially if it affects confidence at work or in social situations.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, few things irk me more than spending a pretty penny on high-quality makeup products only for them to slowly shift and melt on my face, so that by the time I enter work, I resemble a Picasso drawing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Of the roughly 32 million Americans take an antidepressant like Zoloft (pictured), around 21 percent - 6.7 million people - experience this less-than-ideal side effect (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Darji added: ‘I always tell patients this is a real side effect and not something they’re imagining. It can impact their quality of life or make them want to stop their medication, which is why we take it seriously.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you find the sweating to be unbearable, don't stop taking your medicine without the guidance of your doctor, who will begin tapering your dose safely to avoid unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Make sure you speak to your doctor about it. We can adjust the dose, switch to a different medication, or add a small dose of another medication to help manage the sweating,’ Dr Uma Darji, a board-certified family medicine physician, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For millions of people, a sweaty summer (and fall, winter, and spring) is a small price to pay for emotional stability, or at least some semblance of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Your dog’s predictive behavior may cause you to stop and wonder whether your dog is psychic, but can that be truly the case?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dogs have evolved alongside humans for tens of thousands of years, and in that time, we must factor in that they’ve become astonishing &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/dogs/times-your-dog-reads-your-mind" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:readers of our behaviors and emotions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;readers of our behaviors and emotions&lt;/a&gt;.

Pregnancy and Labor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dogs can predict both pregnancy and labor. More accurately, they can sense the scent of many hormones and pheromones associated with pregnancy and impending childbirth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“There are many stories of dogs changing their behavior when pet parent(s) become human parents,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.petmd.com/dog/behavior/surprising-things-your-dog-can-sense" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PetMD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PetMD&lt;/a&gt;. These stories have scientific backup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the hormones that surge during pregnancy and prior to childbirth include progesterone, estrogen, relaxin, human placental lactogen and oxytocin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hormones alter the person’s natural scent, and the dog’s nose detects the change. Studies show that dogs have “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884888/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:220 million olfactory receptors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;220 million olfactory receptors&lt;/a&gt; in their nasal cavity,” whereas humans only have 5 million.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's also likely that dogs sense cues beyond what their noses catch, including changes in behavior like going to the toilet more frequently and throwing up in the morning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, “dogs have an extremely acute sense of hearing, so it's possible that they can hear a fetal heartbeat as early as the 28th week of pregnancy,” says Rachel Barrack, DVM, in an article for &lt;a href="https://www.thebump.com/a/can-dogs-sense-pregnancy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Bump;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Bump&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;3. Natural Phenomena&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Old records from ancient Greece show that dogs fled the city of Helice before an earthquake hit. Similar stories of dogs leaving before natural disasters strike circulate in China.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, we know that dogs can sense natural disasters, thanks to their heightened senses. Dogs recognize changes in barometric pressure (the amount of air pressure in the atmosphere) and electrostatic charge (static electricity).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, when the air pressure drops, scent particles move downward and collect at ground level, making them easier for dogs to pick up. At the same time, static electricity builds up in the dog’s fur, creating small shocks, while the dog’s nose detects electrical currents in the air.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hearing also plays a role in predicting natural occurrences. Dogs can hear rocks crumbling under the ground's surface and thunder rumbling from several miles away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/can-dogs-predict-earthquakes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Kennel Club;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Kennel Club&lt;/a&gt;, “there's no conclusive scientific evidence yet that dogs can predict tremors.” Despite the lack of scientific explanation, “animals seem to sense the impending danger hours in advance,” says &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/15126191/earthquakes-animals" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prof. Dr. Martin Wikelski;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Prof. Dr. Martin Wikelski&lt;/a&gt; of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on anecdotal reports and observations, scientists believe that dogs can predict various natural phenomena, like earthquakes, thunderstorms, volcanic eruptions, floods and tsunamis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs can discern between happy people and scared ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;4. Human Emotions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dogs predict human emotions. Relying on subtle changes in a person’s chemical makeup, body language and facial expression, dogs are able to sense mood swings and emotions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A 2021 study examined the behavioral responses of dogs after being exposed to sweat samples from individuals who were happy and frightened. The tested dogs were more &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8035118/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:social toward the “happy” people;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;social toward the “happy” people&lt;/a&gt; and avoided the “scared” samples.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dogs can also sense the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6912305/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:presence of "negative" people.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;presence of "negative" people.&lt;/a&gt; Negative people tend to be emotionally unstable and have unique chemosignals, explains a study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dogs are so sensitive, intuitive and predictive of human emotions that they seem to catch them as if they were contagious. A 2019 study found that dogs can &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-43851-x#Sec9" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mirror their owners' emotions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;mirror their owners' emotions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, according to an &lt;em&gt;Evolutionary Human Sciences&lt;/em&gt; study, “Dogs can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10426098/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:respond functionally to emotional expressions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;respond functionally to emotional expressions&lt;/a&gt; and can use the emotional information they obtain from others during problem-solving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;5. Paranormal Activity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;From ancient myths to modern-day folklore, there's a historical link between dogs and the spirit world. In Greek mythology, the three-headed Cerberus guarded the underworld’s entrance. In Egyptian belief, Anubis guided souls into the afterlife. In Celtic folklore, dogs were seen as protectors of other worlds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Norse legends, Freya, the goddess of death, rode the crest of a storm on a chariot pulled by giant cats. As natural enemies, dogs would bark and howl when she approached.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, despite chilling stories, confessions on social media and hard-to-explain events, there is no scientific evidence that dogs can see ghosts or sense other paranormal activities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alexandra Horowitz, PhD, a senior research fellow and adjunct associate professor at Barnard College, says, “What I suspect is happening here is people are looking at dog behavior and wanting an explanation, and being reluctant to look at the more obvious ones,” in an article for &lt;a href="https://www.rd.com/article/can-dogs-see-ghosts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reader’s Digest;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reader’s Digest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet, research shows that 45% of Americans &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341979603_Existence_of_ghosts_and_paranormal_entities_overview_on_negative_energy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:believe in the paranormal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;believe in the paranormal&lt;/a&gt;.

It’s a scene etched into our collective memory by decades of TV and film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the real experience of a heart attack rarely fits that narrative. In fact, believing in that dramatic version can delay life-saving treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hollywood’s version has shaped public perception in ways that may be doing more harm than good. The truth is far more complex and subtle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ann Eckhardt, a nursing professor and researcher at &lt;a href="https://www.uta.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The University of Texas at Arlington&lt;/a&gt;, this public misunderstanding is not just a matter of health education. It is a deeply personal mission rooted in years of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-kills-differently-now-than-five-decades-ago/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; and a family experience that first sparked her passion for the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-missing-the-signs-of-a-heart-attack"&gt;Missing the signs of a heart attack &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movies from the 1980s and 1990s cemented an unrealistic idea of heart attacks. The result? Many people don’t recognize the signs when it happens to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did ourselves a disservice in the 1980s and 1990s with what’s known as ‘The Hollywood Heart Attack,’” Dr. Eckhardt said. “That’s unfortunately not real life. It’s not always intense.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes it’s just discomfort that doesn’t feel quite right, so people tend to wait to see a doctor. The longer you wait, the more likely you are to have negative consequences after your &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-remains-the-leading-cause-of-death-worldwide/"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; attack.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tendency to wait, to dismiss symptoms that don’t seem dramatic enough, can cost precious time. And in cardiology, time is muscle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longer blood flow to the heart is restricted, the greater the damage. But if people are looking for cinematic signals, they might miss the real ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-attack-symptoms-can-be-subtle"&gt;Heart attack symptoms can be subtle &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest myths is that heart attacks always present with severe, sudden &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweeteners-erythritol-directly-linked-to-heart-attacks-and-strokes/"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, many symptoms are subtle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People may experience vague discomfort, pressure, or a strange feeling they can’t quite describe. These symptoms are easier to ignore, especially when life is busy or stressful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eckhardt and her team wanted to understand these misconceptions in detail. They explored how people interpret chest pain and whether that interpretation affects how and when they seek care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team has identified a dangerous gap between public belief and medical reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rethinking-the-warning-signs"&gt;Rethinking the warning signs &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people also believe that heart attacks look drastically different in men and women. While that belief was once supported in the medical community, experts are now rethinking the language they use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used to say men have typical symptoms and women have atypical symptoms,” Eckhardt said. “We’re trying very hard to move away from that language now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most common symptom for men and women is chest-related. We created confusion by saying women are somehow completely different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-false-expectations-about-heart-attacks"&gt;False expectations about heart attacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labeling symptoms as typical or atypical can confuse patients. If someone doesn’t feel the expected kind of pain, they may assume it isn’t serious. Worse, they might believe it can’t possibly be a heart attack. That false assurance can delay treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eckhardt’s team wanted to dig deeper into how people form these ideas. To do that, they created the &lt;a href="https://www.heartandlung.org/article/S0147-9563(23)00121-8/abstract?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chest Pain Conception Questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;. The tool is designed to measure what people think heart attack symptoms look like, and where those ideas come from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years into the project, the team made a striking discovery: nearly 75% of respondents had gotten their information about heart attacks from media sources like TV and film. That suggests medical messaging is losing the battle for public attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We often tell people chest pain is a symptom of a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-this-amount-of-coffee-helps-prevent-heart-disease-and-diabetes/"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; attack, but what we don’t tell them is what they might actually feel,” Eckhardt said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For a lot of people, it’s not pain in the traditional sense. It’s more discomfort, pressure, tightness. They just don’t feel quite right, but they can’t really put their finger on it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vague-signs-delay-treatment"&gt;Vague signs delay treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many heart attack sufferers report a general unease or tightness instead of sharp pain. But because it’s vague, they hesitate to call a doctor or go to the hospital. This indecision can lead to devastating outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eckhardt wants medical professionals to change how they talk to patients. Instead of simply asking about chest pain, they should expand the question to include more accurate descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The longer you wait, the more likely it is you’ll have irreversible damage to the heart,” Eckhardt said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, if we can determine what people think a heart attack will be like, perhaps we can help the medical community better triage and ask questions. It’s not just ‘Are you having chest pain?’; it’s also ‘Do you have any discomfort, pressure, tightness, squeezing?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach could help doctors identify patients at risk more effectively. It also makes space for individuals to describe their symptoms without second-guessing themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-lifelong-mission"&gt;A lifelong mission &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Eckhardt, this work is not just about data or education. It is deeply personal. Her commitment to the subject began when she was young, shaped by a frightening family event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That experience sparked my interest early on,” Eckhardt said. When she was in middle school, her grandfather was rushed to the hospital after a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, he survived the ordeal thanks to timely bypass surgery and lived for another two decades. That moment planted the seeds of a lifelong commitment to health education and research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-changing-the-public-perception"&gt;Changing the public perception &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eckhardt and her colleagues know it won’t be easy to re-educate the public. Hollywood images are hard to shake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the team’s research continues, driven by a clear goal: help people recognize real heart attack symptoms, seek help early, and improve outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every person who rethinks their idea of what a heart attack feels like could be one life saved. It is not always about pain. Sometimes, it is a quiet, persistent signal that something is wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heartandlung.org/article/S0147-9563(25)00104-9/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Heart &amp;amp; Lung&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 20:14:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxNeGVsckJGa1htTzlXMkhaOHdXWXFka1haaGRZRm1JeDhLbTN6em1ueXhNMmFMT0g5MXRYQjlWam5jT2VwTGtaMExMRDhRVTRyTHB4QlJnRjF3Wm5MVld0WUJZcW5adThfajF0el9uU1hnUEtxWmR3b2g0bmJGMlhzTmdub3JOMDNlT2xmLXdtUQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，频繁食用鸡蛋与降低阿尔茨海默氏症痴呆症的风险有关- PsyPost | Frequent egg consumption linked to lower risk of Alzheimer’s dementia, study finds - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQR1RVSGJqVXBwWVpzXzVTUXJSQ3NEM0VHNk9zTC12NXBYVjJDTmh3cDdLOER0N2NHUUVZVXdXTHdkNk50X2doR00wVE9IZXB6X3dGUERZbGlQdVZoSWxBVGJtRlU1YWwwcXpHTV9wY2ZyQ2pxbEVEdWtLTFpEdURvbFMwdkJSZ25GZHM3N1VRclNOUWptbll1T2ZxQkxMSVZ5ZDIyVjVrUHU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults who eat eggs more than once a week may be less likely to develop Alzheimer’s dementia, according to a new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2024.05.012" target="_blank"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The researchers found that participants who ate eggs weekly had a lower rate of clinical diagnosis and fewer Alzheimer’s-related brain changes after death. The study also identified dietary choline, a key nutrient found in eggs, as one possible contributor to this protective effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia and one of the leading causes of death among older adults. It is marked by memory loss, cognitive decline, and changes in behavior, and is associated with biological features in the brain such as the buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With millions of people currently living with the disease in the United States, researchers have been searching for ways to reduce the risk or delay its onset. Diet has been one area of focus, especially nutrients that support brain health. Eggs are a natural source of several such nutrients, including choline, omega-3 fatty acids, and lutein. Prior studies suggested that egg intake may support cognitive performance, but few have examined its relationship to Alzheimer’s disease directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this link, the researchers analyzed data from 1,024 participants in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a long-running study of older adults in the Chicago area. All participants were free of dementia at the time they completed a detailed dietary questionnaire. The survey, adapted from a well-known food frequency questionnaire developed at Harvard, asked about their typical diet over the previous year, including how often they ate eggs. Participants were then followed for an average of nearly seven years, during which they underwent yearly assessments for signs of Alzheimer’s dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to clinical evaluations, a subset of 578 participants donated their brains for research after death. These samples allowed the researchers to examine the biological features associated with Alzheimer’s disease and assess whether egg intake was related to the presence of those features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team categorized participants into groups based on how often they consumed eggs: less than once per month, one to three times per month, once per week, and two or more times per week. They then used statistical models to compare the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s dementia across these groups. The models took into account a wide range of other factors, including age, education, physical activity, genetics, and overall diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that people who ate eggs at least once a week had a lower rate of clinical Alzheimer’s diagnosis than those who ate them rarely. Specifically, both the once-a-week and two-or-more-times-per-week groups had about half the risk of developing Alzheimer’s dementia compared to those who consumed eggs less than once a month. These results remained statistically significant even after adjusting for a variety of potential confounding variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain autopsy data supported the clinical findings. Among deceased participants, those who had eaten eggs more than once a week were less likely to show the brain pathology typical of Alzheimer’s disease, including plaques and tangles. Again, the association remained significant after accounting for other variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore why egg consumption might be linked to lower Alzheimer’s risk, the researchers examined dietary choline intake as a potential mediator. Choline is a nutrient essential for producing acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in memory and learning. It also contributes to the structure of cell membranes in the brain. Eggs are the top dietary source of choline in the U.S. diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mediation analysis showed that nearly 40 percent of the association between egg consumption and reduced Alzheimer’s risk could be explained by choline intake. In other words, choline appeared to play a meaningful role in the protective effect observed. Participants who ate eggs more frequently also had significantly higher average choline intake over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides evidence that frequent egg consumption is linked not only to better cognitive outcomes, but also to less underlying brain pathology. The findings support the idea that dietary choices in later life can influence brain aging, and highlight eggs as a potentially beneficial food for older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers caution that the study does not prove that eggs prevent Alzheimer’s disease. The study was observational, meaning it cannot establish cause and effect. There is also the possibility of reverse causation, since some people may change their diet in subtle ways as cognitive decline begins. The dietary questionnaire was only administered once, and it relied on self-reported data, which may introduce recall bias or inaccuracies. Additionally, the food frequency questionnaire only asked about whole egg consumption, not about eggs used as ingredients in other foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the study population was predominantly female, highly educated, and over the age of 80, which may limit how broadly the results apply. The relatively short follow-up period of under seven years also means the study could have missed longer-term effects. Despite these caveats, the study’s strengths include its large sample, long-running cohort, and access to detailed clinical and postmortem data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding for the study came from the National Institutes of Health and the Egg Nutrition Center, among other sources. Several of the authors disclosed financial relationships with food and nutrition organizations, including the egg industry, though the funding sources did not influence the analysis or interpretation of the results. The researchers adhered to transparency guidelines for nutrition research involving private sector funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the authors suggest that additional studies should replicate these findings in other populations, and that randomized controlled trials could help clarify whether egg consumption directly influences Alzheimer’s risk. If the link is confirmed, eggs could become part of broader dietary recommendations aimed at promoting healthy brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2024.05.012" target="_blank"&gt;Association of Egg Intake With Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk in Older Adults: The Rush Memory and Aging Project&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Yongyi Pan, Taylor C.

Further details including the identify of the victim were not released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plague is a bacterial infection known for killing tens of millions in 14th century Europe. Today, it's easily treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21590-bubonic-plague" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;bubonic plague&lt;/a&gt; is the most common form of the bacterial infection, which spreads naturally among rodents like prairie dogs and rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two other forms: septicemic plague that spreads through the whole body, and pneumonic plague that infects the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pneumonic plague is the most deadly and easiest to spread. The bacteria is transmitted through the bites of infected fleas that can spread it between rodents, pets and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can also get plague through touching infected bodily fluids. Health experts recommend taking extra care when handling dead or sick animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cases happen in rural areas of northern New Mexico, northern Arizona, southern Colorado, California, southern Oregon and far western Nevada, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 19:52:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxNMFpTYVlSd0hSc1FZUjZRN2x0Vl9WQTJ2dkRzN2lkM3hGNVBOVExoQlpvVVE4RVR6V3h4N2dpRXhjeVpoUlJWeFpfc0lLLXRjSzN5RG1NRXczaWp0Sm5CY3g1LWdBQ18yVDdudmZlNXVqYmt0ODVmYmpjUGQyc29xZkZkcU1RQQ</guid></item><item><title>大城市的灯光可能会损害您的心脏健康- ScienceAlert | Big City Lights Could Be Damaging Your Heart Health - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxPQmp1SktXUEpnTjlSdEJORWNidHpEcnR1RzVOUC0wMU1lNmJHenBOSV8yRUVzSFhxc1J1OVFsb2NhQl9mM3lHMU5IWUNtWjlSc2dXZnF1dUxYeThhNUwwOXBqWEdGdlp4RjE5UUVfUHdxY0RBRndJalBEYjdRRjNzZUJJUk11T2M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;It might be time to invest in some blackout curtains, turn off the TV before bed, and dim those lamps. New research suggests that exposure to light at night could elevate your risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-gram-of-salt-is-the-difference-for-millions-of-heart-attacks"&gt;multiple heart issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association makes biological sense. Our bodies use light signals to tell &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exposure-to-daylight-predicts-when-youll-fall-asleep-study-shows"&gt;when it's time to sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and any disruption to that routine can interfere with our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/technology-really-is-changing-human-circadian-rhythms-scientists-say"&gt;circadian rhythms,&lt;/a&gt; which regulate countless internal processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Light at night causes circadian disruption, which is a known risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.20.25329961"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; the international team of scientists in a new study, which is yet to be peer-reviewed or published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, it is not well understood whether personal light exposure patterns predict an individual's risk of cardiovascular diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brighter-nights-and-darker-days-can-have-a-serious-effect-on-mortality-risk?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Brighter Nights And Darker Days Can Have a Serious Effect on Mortality Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the researchers analyzed data from 88,905 adults who wore wrist sensors to track light exposure over the course of a week, with follow-up health checks for the next 9.5 years. The volunteers were grouped based on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-night-sky-is-twice-as-bright-as-it-was-only-8-years-ago"&gt;how much light&lt;/a&gt; they were exposed to overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to the bottom half of the participants, the 10 percent exposed to the most light at night had a significantly higher risk of heart issues, including coronary artery disease, heart attack, heart failure, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brisk-walking-could-lower-your-risk-of-heart-rhythm-abnormalities"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt;, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167026" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167026" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/LightGraph.jpg" alt="Nighttime light exposure" class="wp-image-167026 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/LightGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/LightGraph-321x415.jpg 321w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/LightGraph-600x775.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167026" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tracked nighttime light and five different heart health issues. (Windred et al., MedRxiv, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers accounted for factors that impact heart health, including smoking, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heres-why-every-sip-of-alcohol-increases-your-risk-of-cancer"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, diet, sleep duration, physical activity, socioeconomic status, and genetic risk, to try and better isolate the effect of light exposure at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data from this &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"&gt;type of study&lt;/a&gt; doesn't prove direct cause and effect – only that there's a strong association. It's enough to suggest light at night as a risk factor for heart health problems and that minimizing it could be a simple and effective way of reducing risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and coronary artery disease were stronger for women, and relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation were stronger for younger individuals in this cohort," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.20.25329961"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers point to the many functions of our bodies that rely on regular, well-defined circadian rhythms – everything from blood pressure to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bright-light-at-night-may-raise-type-2-diabetes-risk-study-suggests"&gt;glucose tolerance&lt;/a&gt;. Disrupting those rhythms, with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/phenomenon-that-makes-night-shift-harmful-to-the-body-identified"&gt;night shifts&lt;/a&gt; for example, can impact our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the mechanisms at play could be &lt;a href="https://www.osmosis.org/answers/hypercoagulable-state"&gt;hypercoagulability&lt;/a&gt; – an increased tendency for blood to clot, which has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.16468"&gt;previously been linked&lt;/a&gt; to disruptions in circadian rhythms. However, there are likely to be numerous reasons for these associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope to see future studies collecting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/seeing-blue-at-night-may-not-be-whats-keeping-you-up-after-all"&gt;nighttime light&lt;/a&gt; data over a longer period of time, and with extra information about the sources of light, which should help improve our understanding of this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us will now have at least one glowing screen inside our bedrooms, and this gives us another reason to turn those screens off: a &lt;a href="https://sleepreviewmag.com/sleep-health/nearly-two-thirds-fall-asleep-tv/"&gt;survey suggests&lt;/a&gt; more than half of the US population actually falls asleep with the TV on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Avoiding light at night may be a useful strategy for reducing risks of cardiovascular diseases," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.20.25329961"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, but a preprint is available on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.20.25329961"&gt;MedRxiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But how does DNA analysis actually work? And how does it help identify victims in these disastrous events involving mass fatalities?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; analysis involves the collection of two types of samples: postmortem and antemortem. The postmortem DNA is collected at the scene as other specialists take photos of the victims' teeth and police officers collect fingerprints and note specific attributes, such as clothing and personal belongings, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kerstin-Montelius" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kerstin-Montelius" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kerstin Montelius&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a molecular biologist with Sweden's &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rmv.se/english/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.rmv.se/english/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Board of Forensic Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A DNA sample could be from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357775129_Role_of_Forensic_Anthropology_in_Disaster_Victim_Identification_DVI" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357775129_Role_of_Forensic_Anthropology_in_Disaster_Victim_Identification_DVI" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;any tissue of the body&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;," Montelius told Live Science in an email. "The DNA sample is sent to the laboratory, where DNA is extracted from the tissue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those collecting the DNA have to ensure that the sample remains uncontaminated, considering there's a high risk of human remains commingling after mass disasters. The environment, too, can compromise the quality of the sample. For instance, victims of the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center were exposed to intense fire, heat and extinguishing water, and in 2004, victims of the South East Asian tsunami were exposed to seawater and warm, humid air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To minimize contamination, blood or intact soft tissue samples are usually preferred for analysis. The exception would be cases in which remains have putrefied or commingled, where bone and tooth samples are preferred, according to a 2007 paper about minimizing contamination risk published in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1459370018737017606&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs12024-007-0027-0%23%3A~%3Atext%3DBecause%2520it%2520was%2520important%2520that%2Cand%2520at%2520least%25205%2525%2520bleach.&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Fhow-is-dna-used-to-identify-victims-of-mass-disasters" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12024-007-0027-0#:~:text=Because%20it%20was%20important%20that,and%20at%20least%205%25%20bleach." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs12024-007-0027-0%23%3A~%3Atext%3DBecause%2520it%2520was%2520important%2520that%2Cand%2520at%2520least%25205%2525%2520bleach.&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Fhow-is-dna-used-to-identify-victims-of-mass-disasters" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="springer.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/how-do-dna-tests-tell-if-two-people-are-related" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/how-do-dna-tests-tell-if-two-people-are-related"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do DNA tests tell if two people are related?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-WAaFKXmjiSQyGb5xfVhuK" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-WAaFKXmjiSQyGb5xfVhuK slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the effect of precise environmental factors is uncertain, it seems sensible to collect different kinds of tissue sample from each victim," the paper notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step involves preparing a DNA profile of each victim. This requires cleaning and separating DNA from tissue samples, determining the approximate amount of DNA present, and copying that DNA using an enzyme so there's enough to analyze, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2527-5559" target="_blank" data-url="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2527-5559" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jeremy Watherston&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a forensic biologist and executive manager of research and innovation at&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fsq.qld.gov.au/our-people" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fsq.qld.gov.au/our-people" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Queensland Forensic Science&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, the DNA fragments are separated based on their size, resulting in a visual representation of an individual's DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Recovered DNA profiles are then compared to antemortem samples — that is, items known to belong to the victim, such as a toothbrush or razor," Watherson told Live Science in an email. "Alternatively, recovered DNA profiles are compared to samples recovered from known biological relatives — for example, the mother or father of a victim."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If conducted to the high standard expected, this DNA analysis is a foolproof method — and when coupled with other types of chemical analyses, it can even be used to distinguish identical twins, said Peter Ellis, an Australian forensic pathologist who chairs a subgroup of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Forensics/Disaster-Victim-Identification-DVI" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Forensics/Disaster-Victim-Identification-DVI" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Interpol's Disaster Victim Identification working group&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That said, the process does pose a few challenges, he told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Its occasional drawbacks include the technological equipment needed to conduct it, [and] the need for good [postmortem] samples that are not degraded," Ellis said. "Remains that are completely incinerated may not contain enough DNA to allow identification."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although DNA analysis is a vital scientific tool for identifying victims of mass disasters, the process involves a lot of ethical questions, such as "assumptions about where and how identity is situated, how bodies should be treated after death, and how disasters should be managed," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p578153-caroline-bennett" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p578153-caroline-bennett" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caroline Bennett&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of social anthropology and international development at the University of Sussex in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bennett &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14636778.2014.946003" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14636778.2014.946003" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;authored a paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about how the DNA analysis process may conflict with sociopolitical and cultural norms, citing an example of Iraq in 2005, when the "government argued strongly for bodily integrity" for those who went missing during Saddam Hussein’s Ba’athist regime. Iraq’s government also insisted that bone sections, which were collected for DNA analysis, be returned so they could be buried with the bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's important to take such questions into consideration before starting any processes," Bennett told Live Science in an email, "to make sure the treatment of the dead is done with respect and care that is appropriate."&lt;/p&gt;

But the finding is not a total surprise, as nine Utah residents — seven of them in Utah County — have confirmed cases of measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But health officials said they’re sharing the information to remind people that measles is circulating in Utah County and to warn people to take precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Wastewater sampling is a new and useful tool for public health,” Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist, said in the department’s news release. “In this case, we know someone had measles in the Provo area around the time the sample was taken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She said that the information provided by wastewater is most useful when illness is detected in someone who has not previously been identified with the condition, which is not the case right now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“When that happens, we will be able to use the data to alert clinicians in those areas to make sure they are aware someone with measles may come in for care,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Wastewater has been found to be a useful surveillance tool to track infections including COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;WastewaterSCAN officials told the department about the discovery of measles in the sample Friday. The program, which is based at Stanford University, monitors infectious diseases — specifically measles — in wastewater systems across the nation, including sites in Provo and South Salt Lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Utah’s Department of Health and Human Services plans to monitor wastewater for measles at all 35 Utah sites in the future, but the system is not yet fully functional. That should change within the next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“When people get sick with measles, they can shed the virus in their feces or urine which then goes into our wastewater or sewer systems. This can then be detected for days to weeks in wastewater samples. This helps us identify communities where people are infected with measles, sometimes even before we know that anyone is sick, ” Nathan LaCross, manager of the department’s Utah Wastewater Surveillance System, said in the department’s news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Finding an infection in a tested sample doesn’t identify a specific person or household where the illness occurred. Rather, the samples are taken from the water treatment plant where all of a community’s wastewater is funneled to be treated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="About-measles" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;About measles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious illness that easily spreads from person to person unless someone has been vaccinated or already had the illness. While infection may result in mild symptoms like fever, rash, diarrhea and ear infections for some, it can be very dangerous for others, especially including pregnant women, babies and young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;This year, the U.S. has more measles cases than it has seen in many years, including very significant outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico. If spread continues for 12 months, the U.S. is at risk of losing the status it gained 20 years ago as a nation where measles is no longer considered a public health problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Utah health officials say measles is so easily spread that 90% of those who are not vaccinated or do not have natural immunity from previous illness who are exposed to measles will get sick. And it can spread before someone develops the telltale rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;However, the risk of getting measles from wastewater is extremely low, per the department. Measles spreads through the air and close contact with another person. The virus can also linger in the air for some time after someone who has been infected leaves an area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“This is another reminder that measles is in Utah and it is important to protect ourselves and our families from getting measles. The best protection against measles is the MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccine is 97% effective against measles when 2 doses are given. It is very rare for someone to get measles if they are vaccinated,” said Nolen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Measles symptoms may not show up for up to three weeks once someone is infected. The earliest symptoms are usually similar to a cold, including fever, cough and red or watery eyes. A rash follows a few days later. The rash typically starts at the face or hairline and then moves down to cover the rest of the body. It can be accompanied by little white spots in the mouth on the inner lining of the cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;More information on measles in Utah can be found at &lt;a href="https://utah.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ed508d0fee9a2d592f5274e9c&amp;amp;id=1e731a99d1&amp;amp;e=5d6681691a" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;https://epi.utah.gov/measles/&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Being diagnosed with autism at a young age offers several significant benefits that can set children down a positive life path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emerging research is indicating to child psychiatrists that genetic testing and refined screening tools could soon catch cases that once went undetected, preventing years of struggle and isolation for thousands of overlooked kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Current ASD diagnostics generally rely on observed behaviors – children's social interactions, repetitive behaviors, sound sensitivity, etc. – which can be subjective and brushed off for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But genetic subtypes for these traits offer objective, measurable clues to autism's origins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ryan Sultan, a double board‑certified psychiatrist and the Founder &amp;amp; Medical Director of Integrative Psych, told DailyMail.com: 'What makes this new research particularly compelling is its move towards identifying biological markers and genetic subtypes within the autism spectrum.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sultan, who was not involved in the research, added: 'The prospect of diagnosing ASD based on genetic or biological profiles, rather than solely behavioral criteria, represents a significant step forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It not only holds promise for more precise and early diagnoses but also opens the door for developing targeted interventions and treatments.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Current diagnostic frameworks categorize autism along a three-tiered spectrum, Levels 1 through 3, based on the severity of social challenges and restricted, repetitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;With this new genetic roadmap, earlier and more accurate diagnoses could become the norm, ensuring kids get the critical support they need during their most formative years (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But these broad classifications fail to capture the condition's extraordinary nuance, often overlooking critical individual differences, from sensory sensitivities to co-occurring conditions like ADHD or epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For decades, scientists have sought to refine this tiered model by finding biologically and behaviorally distinct subtypes rooted in genetics and neural circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlocking these subtypes and incorporating this framework could revolutionize care—transforming a one-size-fits-all approach into personalized medicine for the autistic community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As more children become accurately diagnosed and better accommodated at home and at school, which may provide a specialized program for children on the spectrum, the number of new diagnoses nationwide are likely to increase still further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Raising awareness of the different categories of ASD particularly the mild type can increase diagnosis as more individuals become aware of their symptoms and challenges,' Dr Nechama Sorscher, a child psychologist specializing in autism, told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Most importantly, understanding the genetic etiology of these symptoms removes stigma and blame and empowers individuals with ASD as well as their friends and families.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Social/Behavioral subtype (37 percent of the roughly 5,000 children studied) shows classic autism traits without developmental delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What sets this group apart is their high rate of co-occurring mental health conditions, including ADHD, anxiety, and depression. Researchers found these individuals often go undiagnosed until school age, when social demands increase, because their developmental progress masks underlying challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children with Mixed ASD and Developmental Delay (19 percent) experience early speech and motor delays but fewer mental health issues. Genetic analysis revealed this group is more likely to carry rare inherited mutations, suggesting a strong prenatal origin for their autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Interestingly, their core symptoms vary widely—some struggle more with social interactions, while others show pronounced repetitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Moderate Challenges group (34 percent) presents with milder autism symptoms and typically meets developmental benchmarks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike the first subtype, they typically don't experience significant mental health comorbidities, which may reduce their need for long-term medication or intensive interventions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This group's genetic profile involves lower-impact variants that may explain their more subdued presentation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Broadly Affected subtype (10 percent) faces the most severe challenges, combining developmental delays, significant social-communication difficulties, and psychiatric comorbidities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genetically, they're more likely to have damaging spontaneous mutations not inherited from their parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings challenge previous assumptions by showing autism's genetic triggers can activate both before and after birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An estimated 2.3 million children and seven million adults in the US have ASD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While genes explain about 20 percent of cases, researchers emphasize the remaining 80 percent likely involve a complex interplay of environmental factors, modifications to DNA that regulate gene expression, and gene-environment interactions that scientists still don't fully understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Olga Troyanskaya, Director of Princeton Precision Health and lead author of the study, told DailyMail.com: 'Just because 80 percent of individuals do not have a known genetic cause does not mean that genetics are not causing their condition. Many studies have shown that autism is very (70-90 percent) heritable, so the majority of cases are primarily genetic in origin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, the complexity of these genetics means that we cannot pinpoint the precise genetic changes causing autism in 80 percent of individuals with the diagnosis, because the exact architecture of autism genetics is still unclear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'An important potential impact of our study is that the subtypes we identify allow researchers to dissect the genetic heterogeneity of autism, potentially enabling identification of genetic causes for more individuals with autism.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 2.3 million children and seven million adults in the US have ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diagnoses have risen sharply over the past two decades, according to shifting statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2000, about 1 in 150 children received an ASD diagnosis; by 2020, that figure had climbed to 1 in 36—a near-quadrupling that reflects both greater awareness and evolving diagnostic criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The surge is further illustrated in a 2024 study of 12.2 million Americans' health records, which revealed a 175 percent increase in autism diagnoses over an 11-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some experts attribute the rise to expanded screening and reduced stigma, others argue that biological and environmental factors may also play a role—a debate that continues to divide researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Troyanskaya added: 'We are not entirely sure how long it would take for these subtypes to be integrated into the clinic - changes in clinical diagnoses typically require many steps of independent replication, feasibility studies, and assessments of the impact on diagnosis and care before being formally adopted.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But that’s not all. Depending on the specific vaccine we’re talking about, that jab might also prevent cancer, heal herpes lesions, help you keep most of your marbles, prevent your kids from dying in early childhood, improve your skin and so much more. These surprising bonuses that can come with vaccination, called beneficial non-specific effects, are common, but not widely understood. In fact, no one knew about them until relatively recently — and when researchers first discovered all this, no one believed them at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we look at that, let’s consider just how good these non-specific effects can get. Well, the Shingrix (or Zoster vaccine recombinant) vaccine, which is recommended for all adults in later middle age, prevents up to 95 percent of shingles cases. But that’s not all. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;It also reduces your risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, with a 20 percent relative risk reduction over seven years. (Shingles is the long-term result of a childhood chicken pox infection, which can hide inside you for decades before re-emerging in notoriously painful fashion.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Martin, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, told Salon in a video interview that certain viruses, like the herpes group — which includes the chicken pox virus and the one that causes cold sores, as well as genital herpes — “are notorious for these reactivation and latency patterns, and  changing your health status over the long term based on how much they’re around and active in your body.” It seems that the Shingrix vaccine’s remarkable effect on rates of dementia in older adults is the result of preventing some of those health status changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What the shingles vaccine does is it dampens reactivations of latent viruses in a way that may be protecting other parts of your body,” Martin said. Including, it seems, the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella or MMR vaccine protects children against those three diseases, of course. (Two doses are 97 percent effective against measles, for example). But that’s not all. It also reduces &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37482223/"&gt;your child’s all-cause mortality&lt;/a&gt; — that is, their risk of dying of any cause, for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral polio vaccine prevents — surprise! — polio. But that’s not all. Vaccinating a newborn baby within its first two days &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4614411/"&gt;reduces their risk of dying&lt;/a&gt; in their first year by 10 to 62 percent, while also reducing the risk of flu, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35711442/"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9196174/"&gt;bacterial diarrhea and otitis media, among other infections&lt;/a&gt;, studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines currently in development for Staphylococcus aureus infections, including MRSA, might have the side effect of &lt;a href="https://thesecretlifeofskin.com/2023/10/12/vaccines-skin-microbiome-and-skin-diseases/"&gt;fighting atopic dermatitis, cellulitis and impetigo — maybe even acne.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We constantly hear from public health officials about how we should get vaccines because it’s good for us, like flossing our teeth. In the U.S., rather obviously, the public health message has gotten more confused of late. We constantly hear from pseudoscience grifters and bleach-drinking advocates that we shouldn’t get vaccines because, well, because of a bunch of hooey. So why isn’t anyone telling us about these remarkable side effects of vaccination? If you were trying to sell a product that not only keeps you healthy when other people are getting sick with, say, chicken pox, but also prevents you from getting a painful and potentially damaging disease many years later, wouldn’t you want to advertise that? Because that thing would sell like gangbusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We constantly hear from pseudoscience grifters and bleach-drinking advocates that we shouldn’t get vaccines because, well, because of a bunch of hooey. Why isn’t anyone telling us about the remarkable side effects of vaccination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the numbers don’t lie. Mind you, this is science we’re talking about, and there’s an important distinction between noticing an association and confirming a causal connection. So what’s the cause? By what mechanism do vaccines do so much unexpected good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are “basically two ways” of understanding these “off-target effects,” Martin said. “One way of looking at it is that the disease the vaccine is preventing is actually causing a wider range of illnesses and issues than we ever realized before we started vaccinating.” she explained. Influenza, which can cause falls and cognitive status issues in older people during acute infection and recovery, offers a classic example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But then, if you look at something like measles,” Martin continued, “those other effects are giant.” Measles is distinctive in that it essentially goes into a person’s system and wipes out the T-cells — a vital part of the immune response — gained during previous infections of other kinds. “Any of the lived experience that you’ve had to build up antibodies against infection then gets wiped out by the measles virus. When you recover from a live measles infection … you’ve just lost all of your immunity. It’ll be like you’re a kid in day care for the first time. So you’re going to be encountering all of these diseases with very little prior immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the beneficial non-specific effect of measles vaccination, then, derives from preventing a disease whose &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/03/11/you-dont-want-to-throw-a-measles-party/"&gt;health impacts are more serious and long-term&lt;/a&gt; than scientists originally understood. But there’s a further effect, believed to relate to another phenomenon called trained immunity. That’s what happens when activating an organism’s innate or built-in immunity can result in a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7186935/"&gt;later revved-up response to a new immune challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of the effects of various vaccines, Martin said, suggest that the “mild, low-level replication” of a pathogen — which is how most vaccines work — can result in “training the immune system” to protect you against other diseases. Peter Aaby, a Danish anthropologist, discovered the beneficial non-specific effects of vaccines while working in the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau after it gained independence in the 1970s. As in many other poor countries, Guinea-Bissau’s extremely high child mortality, which meant more than half of all children died before age 5, was attributed by mostly Western scientists and policymakers to malnutrition. But when Aaby’s team conducted a survey of 1,200 children, they found that malnourishment was virtually nonexistent. Just after that survey was completed, a severe measles epidemic swept the area, killing one-fourth of all children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So malnutrition no longer made sense as the “explanation of severe child mortality,” Aaby told Salon in a video interview. “The stunning thing was, there was no relationship. The nutritional status of the children who died of measles was not different from those who survived.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he had a hard time getting the Swedish research organization that had hired him, or other medical authorities who reviewed his work, to address the implications of the data. He eventually tested a new hypothesis: It wasn’t nutritional status that determined how bad a case of measles was, but rather how intensely a child had been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those most likely to die, Aaby found, were “the children who are infected inside the home.” When many children lived under the same roof, he explained, they were likely to be exposed to far greater doses of the virus. “That turned out to be by far the strongest explanation of measles mortality,” he said. “I have also subsequently shown that the same pattern applies not just to measles, but [also] for chicken pox, RSV, polio and whooping cough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaby’s team then went door to door providing measles vaccinations, and a few years later he received a follow-up report, describing what happened to children who had been involved in the study and subsequent ones carried out in rural areas. “I got the idea that maybe measles vaccine had an impact on child survival,” he said. And sure enough, “nearly every time that someone had died [of any cause], they had not been vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of the effects of various vaccines, Martin said, suggest that the “mild, low-level replication” of a pathogen — which is how most vaccines work — can result in “training the immune system” to protect you against other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later studies from several countries with data on childhood mortality before and after introduction of the measles vaccine likewise showed a minimum 50% reduction in mortality among children under age 5 — “an unbelievable effect,” as Aaby put it. Children who had previously survived a measles infection had even lower risks of mortality: It’s fair to say that what didn’t kill them did indeed make them stronger, but at a terrible risk, since a quarter of measles-infected children did not survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other vaccines were likewise shown to reduce childhood mortality, without the risks associated with infection, and to an astonishing degree: the BCG vaccine (against tuberculosis) did so by 45%, for example. Aaby’s findings  were initially dismissed, since he was an anthropologist with no medical credentials  (he now has a PhD in medicine), but no longer. In 2016 the WHO noted the otherwise inexplicable effects of BCG and measles vaccines on childhood mortality, while in 2020 the widely-respected journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d42859-020-00018-3"&gt;Nature included non-specific effects in a list of&lt;/a&gt; “milestones in vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Child mortality under age 5 has declined by 86 percent, and there is no way you can explain it by controlling measles and whooping cough and tuberculosis,” Aaby emphasized to Salon. “It’s the immune stimulation that we have provided” through vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the protection vaccines provide against a specific pathogen — we need boosters for COVID-19 because the vaccine’s effects wane over time — this enhanced general immune protection may last for just a few months or endure for years, as with the effect of measles vaccination on overall health. Early findings show that existing COVID vaccines may also offer beneficial non-specific effects in similar fashion, as Aaby suggests in a PowerPoint presentation he shared with Salon, by revving up our immune systems against other pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this amounts to saying that vaccines have no risks, or even that their non-specific effects are always beneficial. Aaby found, for example, that what’s known as the high-titer measles vaccine, when given to very young children, was later associated with increased mortality for girls, a finding of sex differences in immune response that has been seen with other vaccines as well. (That specific vaccine is no longer in use.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research revealed that it was the sequence in which vaccines were administered, not the vaccines themselves, that was responsible for higher mortality. Changing the sequence of vaccines, usually by giving live vaccines before non-live ones, maximizes the beneficial effect and removes that additional risk for girls, apparently by programming the innate immune system in a better way. Aaby is now testing whether combining live and non-live vaccines may reduce negative effects while maintaining beneficial effects, both the specific protection against a given infection and the non-specific strengthening of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s essential to evaluate the benefits and risks of any vaccine carefully, of course. But too often, public attention is fixated on rare and unlikely negative side effects when the overall protection offered by a vaccine far outweighs any statistical risk. Unless you are a person with known risk factors involving bad outcomes, you’re almost certainly at greater risk by not getting a given vaccine. Epidemiologists and public health researchers are supposed to crunch the numbers and figure these things out, and to adjust recommendations as new findings come in, especially recommendations about what vaccines children need, and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many experts in the field, Martin is concerned that HHS Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5429604/cdc-rfk-acip-vaccine-committee"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s recent dismissal&lt;/a&gt; of the entire CDC panel of vaccine experts who do that, and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5430870/cdc-vaccine-experts-rfk-jr"&gt;their replacement with known vaccine “skeptics”&lt;/a&gt; or outright opponents&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5430870/cdc-vaccine-experts-rfk-jr"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; puts that at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="top_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often, public attention is fixated on rare and unlikely negative side effects. Unless you are a person with known risk factors involving bad outcomes, you’re almost certainly at greater risk by &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; getting a given vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I worry what data they are going to use,” Martin said. “if they are not acknowledging the data that’s there and being generated. It is ready for them to review right now. This is an ongoing process that we’re always iterating on, every year, putting out vaccine data” to guide policy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High child mortality was taken for granted for centuries. So what happened? In a word, vaccines happened. Anyone who visits an older cemetery anywhere in North America is startled to see the large numbers of tombstones inscribed with the names of infants and young children. Such deaths are relatively rare on our continent today, but Aaby’s work suggests that this dramatic change is not purely due to the prevention of the specific diseases targeted by vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, he contends, the “enormous reduction we’ve had in [child] mortality in low-income countries in the last 30 or 40 years” can only be explained by the non-specific effects he has documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaby and his colleagues have followed populations before and after the oral polio vaccine campaigns that began in 1995 and ended in roughly 2015 in various low-income countries such as Guinea-Bissau, Ghana, Bangladesh and Uganda. They determined that childhood mortality overall was roughly 25% lower after the campaign than before. Add to that similar effects from BCG and measles vaccination, and we have, Aaby says, an explanation for the dramatic decline in childhood mortality in many such countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major reason why the U.S. and Western Europe have seen dramatic population increase over the last 200-plus years, Aaby says, is the introduction of the smallpox vaccine in 1800. That wasn’t just that vaccine prevented one specific and often deadly disease, he argues, but because of the vaccine’s overall effect on immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of things that we’ve forgotten to say” to vaccine-hesitant parents concerned about rare negative effects, said Martin, largely “because measles infection in the United States has been so incredibly rare for the last 30 years.” In other words, at a cultural level we have simply forgotten how common, and how serious, the long-term damage  from exposure to measles and other diseases used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think people in other countries who have had endemic measles understand that more acutely than we do,” Martin said. In many such countries, people have &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-025-01143-8"&gt;high confidence in vaccination&lt;/a&gt; despite less reliable access to vaccines, and the reverse is also true, with people in higher-income countries expressing greater vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there’s evidence to suggest it may have been a mistake to stop administering the smallpox vaccine after the total elimination of smallpox, or to end the BCG vaccine as tuberculosis infection became rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large Danish study compared children who received the BCG and smallpox vaccines to a cohort that did not. Over nearly 40 years, researchers have found that those who received either vaccine as children had &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/2/695/2622844"&gt;significantly lower risks of dying of natural causes&lt;/a&gt; — not just in childhood but clear into their 40s, which was as far as the data followed them. Just because certain diseases are eliminated, Aaby argues, is not necessarily a good reason to remove the relevant vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these almost magical-seeming but real and meaningful effects of vaccines, Martin was dismayed to see experts like the highly qualified and vetted CDC vaccine panel members dismissed by Kennedy and accused, without evidence, of conflicts of interest. “This is work that people are doing because they think it’s important,” she said. “They’re not getting any financial benefit. It was jarring to see it swapped out so quickly like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
