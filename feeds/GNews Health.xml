    &lt;p&gt;Curtis Jackson was feeling fit and healthy in late 2020 when he decided to update his life insurance policy: He was in better shape than he'd been in a while, but he wanted to make sure his wife and three kids were taken care of if anything happened to him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson, now 46, underwent an intensive physical, and everything seemed to be going well until he received a strange phone call. The call was focused on a questionnaire he had filled out. Jackson had truthfully marked that he did not drink alcohol. But his liver numbers were those of "a functioning alcoholic," he was told. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It set off alarm bells. Jackson went to his primary care physician for another round of bloodwork. That doctor thought he had a problem with his gallbladder. Jackson went to have his gallbladder removed. During that operation, doctors found he had an unusual condition called primary sclerosing cholangitis, or PSC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chronic, progressive disease affects the liver and inflames the bile ducts, causing liver damage. Patients eventually need a liver transplant. There's also a small but real chance of a deadly diagnosis: a dangerous cancer called cholangiocarcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early treatment and diagnosis can make a difference, so Jackson started undergoing two MRIs a year at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona to make sure he was cancer-free. He also had a regular test to check the progress of his PSC. In October 2024, Jackson had a nerve-wracking appointment where the technician scoping him seemed "very concerned." He felt healthy, but was worried by the appointment. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She didn't say that it was cancer, but she was hinting towards it," Jackson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three weeks later, Jackson and his wife received the news he had been dreading: The tests had diagnosed him with the deadly cancer. He would need to undergo intensive treatment to try to fight the illness. It felt like a repeat of when he had had the initial PSC diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was feeling fine ... and both times netted a result of something pretty serious," Jackson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is cholangiocarcinoma? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholangiocarcinoma, or bile duct cancer, is considered a silent killer, according to Dr. Tanios Bekaii-Saab, the chairman of the division of hematology and medical oncology at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona. Bekaii-Saab was Jackson's oncologist. It tends to spread to other organs before symptoms appear, so most patients are diagnosed "too late to cure," Bekaii-Saab said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 20% of people with PSC are diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, said Dr. Aqel Bashar, the director of the Mayo Clinic's Transplant Center in Phoenix, Arizona, who also treated Jackson. It's a rare disease, affecting about 1 in 100,000 people in the U.S., Bashar said. Not all cases are associated with PCS. Like many other cancers, it is on the rise, Bekaii-Saab said, with diagnoses of cholangiocarcinoma increasing more than 50% in the past decade. Fewer than 10% of the people diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma live more than five years, Bashar said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to treat cholangiocarcinoma is with a liver transplant, Bekaii-Saab said. But it can only be done if the disease is caught early, before the cancer spreads. Many cholangiocarcinoma patients are not eligible for a liver transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Jackson's case was caught early. He underwent three weeks of chemotherapy and radiation to kill as many cancer cells as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically, I lived at Mayo Clinic. I would literally do work out of the parking lot, and then go and do radiation," Jackson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During treatment, he lost about 30 pounds. But despite the odds, he remained optimistic that everything would work out. He even encouraged his wife to start a long-anticipated kitchen renovation. In the middle of the process, the family was told a liver was available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 6, he was wheeled into surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Surgery and recovery &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surgery took about four hours. Six days later, Jackson was released from the hospital. Testing showed that he was cancer-free. For the next year, he will undergo weekly blood tests and have monthly check-ups. He will need close monitoring for the rest of his life, Bashar said, since his transplant needs to be monitored and doctors need to make sure his cholangiocarcinoma does not return.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Jackson is trying to focus on his home and family, he said. His routine is "pretty close to normal," though he still can't lift more than 10 pounds, and climbing stairs can be draining. He gained back much of the weight he lost in treatment, and his energy levels are close to where they were before the cancer diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Things are definitely getting back to normal, which is really exciting. I wasn't expecting that so fast," Jackson said. "We might call it either lucky, or blessed, or whatever. I am just so thankful that I was able to bounce back so quickly." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jacksons are putting the finishing touches on the kitchen renovation, and planning to travel to North Carolina for vacation this summer. He also wants to plan family trips outside the country once he needs less frequent check-ups. His other priority is turning his story into something that can help others, and advocating for organ transplant and donation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have a new passion now," Jackson said. "I'm here because of these things. I would like to help this going forward and make sure people are learning the importance of donation." &lt;/p&gt;

"We typically thought of the sperm as a bag of DNA on a tail. But as we've started to realise, it's quite a complex cell – there's a lot of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3015006/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;[other] genetic information in there&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Almost 200 years later, in 1869, Johannes Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss physician and biologist, was studying human white blood cells collected from pus left on soiled hospital bandages when he &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7268995/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;discovered what he called "nuclein"&lt;/a&gt; inside the nuclei.

This is where the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26843/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;cortical reaction&lt;/a&gt; comes in.

Human sperm cells are microscopic, so we can't see them with the naked eye. But some fruit fly species produce sperm cells &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18005" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;20 times their own body length&lt;/a&gt;. That would be like a man producing sperm the length of a 40m (130ft) python.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Why do males in some species make a few giant sperm?" asks Pitnick. "The answer, it turns out, is because females have evolved reproductive tracts that favour them." That's "not really much of an answer", he adds, because it's just the redirects the question: why have females evolved this way? "We still don't understand that at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Research suggests sperm counts are tumbling globally and the decline appears to be accelerating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But it does teach us that sperm as they exist in the male body is only half the story, says Pitnick. "There's a massive sex bias historically in science. There's been this obscenely biased male focus on male traits. But it turns out that what's driving the system is female evolution – and males are just trying to keep up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It turns out the female reproductive tract is this incredibly, rapidly evolving environment," says Pitnick, "and we don't know much about what sperm do inside the female. That is the big, hidden world. I think the female reproductive tract is the greatest unexplored frontier for sexual selection, theory and speciation [the process by which &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/speciation-the-origin-of-new-species-26230527/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;new species are formed&lt;/a&gt;]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The fruit fly's long-tailed sperm, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-024-02587-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;suggests Pitnick&lt;/a&gt;, could be considered an ornament – much like a deer's antlers or a peacock's tail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ornaments are a "sort of a weapon in evolution", explains Pitnick. More than just a defence from predators, ornaments like antlers and horns often have two roles to play. "A lot of these weapons are about sex, and usually male-male competition. The [fruit fly's] long sperm flagellum really meets the definitional criteria of an ornament. We think the female tract has traits that bias fertilisation in favour of some sperm phenotypes over others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;We know a lot about pre-mating sexual selection, Pitnick says. "Say, it's &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20240902-how-controlled-burns-can-help-wildlife" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;prairie chickens dancing&lt;/a&gt; out on a grassland, or a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p023wbh0" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;bird of paradise displaying&lt;/a&gt; in a rainforest. It's motion, it's colour, it's smells?" Processing this sensory input, explains Pitnick, leads to decision making – whether the pair mate or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But, Pitnick says, the sexual selection that goes on inside the female after mating – and how this drives the evolution of sperm – largely remains a mystery. "We still understand very little about the genetics of ornaments and preferences," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Alamy Sperm are so tiny that they can be difficult to study.

(It's also worth noting that many people around the world are not having as many children as they want for other reasons too, such as the prohibitive cost of parenthood, as a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clynq459wxgo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;recent United Nation population Fund report highlighted&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"With all those moving parts, there are so many things that could go wrong," says Hannah Morgan, a post-doctoral research associate in maternal and fetal health at the University of Manchester, UK. "It could be a mechanism: it doesn't swim very well, so it can't get to the egg. Or it could be something more intricate within the head of the sperm, or other regions of the sperm. It's so specialised in so many different ways, that lots of little things can go wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One way to see if a man may be infertile is to look inside the sperm, says Morgan. "How does the DNA look? How is it packaged? How fragmented is it? To break open the sperm, there's a whole range of stuff you could look at. But what is a good or bad measurement? We don't actually know." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Perhaps by unravelling the mystery of sperm and how they function, Morgan says, we might begin to understand male infertility too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;&lt;b id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 09:01:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPektuVkZrZTRMWnRMSHF0UGdvNGRrUXF6OWpjeXRtNHZwUHdBMTlwVk0wY3ZfZGNDRFFZQ2RpeWlLRk1POVQtZXl0ZTdLODc5clVfWHg4N0lzcmpLRVJuZVVwbjVYbXpFME1WQzYwczd3VXJOc29SeXVKWklNUjFSQjNndldoV1pfZnhTWGhpNUpIeEw5NG5vcWduWDdTLVBfZVBz</guid></item><item><title>肠道问题、糖尿病或高血压？抛弃这些水果-印度时报 | Gut issues, Diabetes or High BP?

Most of the times, that is largely the case, but some fruits can actually increase certain medical conditions because of their sugar content, acidity, or nutrient burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing what to steer clear of can assist you in controlling symptoms better and with more informed decisions. Below is a guide to which fruits may not be your friend if you have any of the following conditions. (source: Healthline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have diabetes, blood glucose control is paramount. Fruits such as bananas and grapes can be harmful; they contain a high glycemic wallop. Their natural sugars are rapidly absorbed and will give your glucose levels a boost. You don't have to eliminate all fruits, but it's advisable to stick to lower-sugar choices such as berries and steer clear of overly ripe types altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kidney issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with compromised kidney function, potassium can build up to dangerous levels. Bananas and oranges are particularly high in potassium, which can strain the kidneys. It’s best to limit or avoid these fruits if your doctor has warned you about high potassium intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatives like apples or grapes are typically better tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Joint Pain or inflammatory conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have arthritis or chronic joint inflammation, some of the fruits in the nightshade category, such as tomatoes and eggplants, trigger inflammation. While technically fruits, these may be included in main courses rather than desserts. Many people experience flare-ups if they eat them regularly, so an elimination trial could identify whether they're a trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bloating and gas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples, watermelon, and cherries are gut fermenters. If you have issues with bloating or discomfort in the digestive system, these FODMAP-rich fruits may be the offender. Limiting the amount or cooking them lightly might help alleviate symptoms. Watch how your body reacts, particularly if your digestive system is already sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Skin issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skin conditions such as acne, eczema, or psoriasis can be exacerbated by some tropical fruits. Mangoes, pineapples, and oranges are high in substances that could possibly cause inflammation or allergic responses in sensitive patients. If your flare-ups occur around fruit-laden meals, try reducing to observe if your skin improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heart disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty or sugary fruits such as coconut and dried fruits are problematic for individuals with heart ailments. Dried fruits might be a healthy choice for snacks, but they tend to be calorie-rich and sugary. Coconut has been known to have saturated fat that might increase cholesterol levels. Be moderate about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stomach sensitivity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have acid reflux or a sensitive stomach lining, pineapples and citrus fruits can irritate your system. Their acidity level is extremely high, causing discomfort or aggravating gastritis. If you suffer from digestive flare-ups, go for less acidic fruits such as bananas or melons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Low immunity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with compromised immune systems need to exercise care with overripe or dried fruits. They may contain molds or provide a source of food for toxic gut bacteria, resulting in infections or imbalances. Fresh, well-washed fruits are always the best option, and anything which appears excessively soft or fermented or has been stored for long periods should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High cholesterol and migraine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut, dried fruits, and citrus could aggravate both. Coconut's saturated fat and dried fruits' concentrated sugars can lead to increased cholesterol. Citrus, on the other hand, has been reported to induce migraines in others. If you're susceptible to either, staying vigilant about your consumption can spell a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fruits are usually a foundation of healthy eating, but when you have a chronic illness, it's all about personalization. It's not about vilifying any single fruit it's about making wiser, more individualised decisions for your body. Always speak with your doctor or a registered dietitian before removing foods from your diet, but being aware of these associations can make you feel more in charge of your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 05:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4wFBVV95cUxONDhfVHc1a3dwZ0M5amFUbTkwdDRuZ25ic3hpWmVBbG1xc2ZYMVNDNUUzWFRYUEdxYnRZdFJuTGRpS1JTTUlzc1FuZ3VFa2FFSHdoNEFobnZJVjZUMDVKelhZbUZoUXFSczZmTEVTdm14Zjdpdm8zOWh5cTVtLU9FNVplY2VDZEVyTjZpeXB6SFBVSy1xMW5tbG9vaTM1NWN3Mng3QThrc3UxcTdybFBXWTZheUlWWk1ydDRiak5TN3NHd01OeF9RQ2lEc2NyWDRKeXZLR3Z5UmUyblc2NUl1eWFESQ</guid></item><item><title>甜点中令人惊讶的成分会增加心脏病发作的风险-每日邮报 | Surprising ingredient in dessert favorites that raises your risk of a heart attack - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiologists are warning of an often overlooked ingredient in desserts that can lead to high blood pressure if consumed in excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically a garnish on cookies, bread and butter, soft pretzels, and caramel treats, coarse sea salt contains more sodium than its less expensive grocery store alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People enjoy the added crunch and marriage of savory and sweet in desserts, but people are inadvertently eating too much salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because coarse salt has larger crystals, it may feel less salty per bite, leading some people to use more than they would with fine salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excessive sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The body &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14603535/Adding-salt-food-increase-risk-depression-anxiety-40-cent-study-finds.html"&gt;only needs a small amount&lt;/a&gt; of sodium to function properly.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Body parts like hands, feet, and ankles are likely to swell. And feelings of thirst take over due to dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Too much salt before bed can also cause restless sleep. Studies suggest high-salt diets may alter cortisol (stress hormone) levels, which regulate sleep-wake cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12737661/Reducing-salt-one-teaspoon-blood-pressure-medication.html" class=""&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at Vanderbilt University found that reducing daily salt intake by just one teaspoon is as effective as blood pressure medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They tested high and low-salt diets on hundreds of patients, some of whom had high blood pressure, and found that cutting out a can of Heinz soup each day lowered people's blood pressure by six percent within a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This reduction was comparable to that of thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, a popular blood pressure medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An estimated 89 percent of adults and around 94 percent of children consume too much sodium, according to the CDC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;“Obviously we need some sodium—it's essential for life,” Dr Egan said. But ‘here we are with an average intake of 3,400 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Now the body has to make a lot of adjustments, but we can get by with very little sodium,’ he said, noting ‘there's very little danger in this country that most people won't get enough sodium, even if they're eating those fresh foods and not processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They'll still—for the most part—get more than sufficient sodium that the body needs,” said Dr. Egan. “We live in a state of pretty much constant excess.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The first two symptoms ― which aren’t commonly associated with heart attacks ― led her to believe the sensations had more to do with her dinner the night before than a serious medical concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Holliman, many people don’t know that stomach symptoms can, indeed, be signs of a heart attack. While not the most common warning sign (chest pain is most reported), nausea is also not uncommon during a cardiac event, according to &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1316106776/sean-p-heffron" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Sean Heffron&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It “tends to depend somewhat on which blood vessel in the heart is affected,” Heffron explained. Additionally, nausea is more commonly seen in women, Heffron said, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/heart_attack.htm" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;as is vomiting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other heart attack signs in women include jaw pain, neck pain, a dull feeling of chest discomfort, upper abdomen pain, back pain and excessive tiredness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s so important to hear stories like this, because many women think it has to be like, ‘I’m clutching my chest and falling to the ground like you see in the movies,’ and it can be much more subtle,” Dr. Tara Narula, a cardiologist and NBC News medical contributor, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/nausea-widowmaker-heart-attack-symptom-women-rcna136801" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;told “Today.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks can look very different in women than in men, which means that sufferers and doctors alike sometimes dismiss them. But it’s important to recognize the signs, especially since heart disease “is the leading cause of death for women in this country,” Narula told “Today.” “One woman every 80 seconds dies of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to tell if your nausea is part of a heart attack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reaching your 60s is a milestone worth celebrating. And while this decade can be filled with travel and more time spent with family, you may also experience some unexpected changes that aren’t quite as welcoming. To keep your energy levels up, mood stable and health on track year after year, it’s important to be intentional about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8067323/7-day-high-protein-meal-plan-for-healthy-aging/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the food on your plate&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Certain foods can go a long way in supporting your body as it ages, whether it’s by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;boosting brain health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-11745664" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;strengthening bones&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heart-healthy-foods-to-eat-in-january-8768223" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;protecting your heart&lt;/a&gt;. According to dietitians, adding more of these six nutrient-packed foods to your routine can help you feel your best and stay active and energized throughout your golden years. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most powerful foods for longevity is one that you don’t actually need a lot of to see big benefits. “Walnuts provide plant-based omega-3s, antioxidants and polyphenols, all of which play a role in brain and heart health as we age,” says &lt;a href="https://samanthacassetty.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Samantha Cassetty, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;, partner with California Walnuts. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Using data from the Nurses’ Health Study, researchers found that women who ate at least two servings or walnuts per week in their late 50s and early 60s were more likely to experience healthy aging, which includes being free from chronic disease, memory problems, physical disability and mental health issues after age 65 compared to those who did not eat walnuts regularly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aim to enjoy 2 ounces of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069681/benefits-of-walnuts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;walnuts&lt;/a&gt; weekly, either on their own or incorporated into recipes. Try adding these crunchy nuts to salads, overnight oats, homemade snack bars and more. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-legumes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Legumes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Maintaining bone density is critical for maintaining independence and overall quality of life as we age. Approximately 10 million adults over age 65 have osteoporosis, and while physical activity and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-ways-to-maintain-muscle-mass-to-live-longer-8547770" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; help, adding legumes to your diet can also support bone health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Legumes are an excellent source of plant-based protein and fiber, supporting muscle maintenance, gut health and reduced inflammation,” says &lt;a href="https://erinpalinski.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Legumes include beans, lentils, peas and peanuts. While all legumes can &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-8737183" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support strong bones&lt;/a&gt;, chickpeas may be particularly beneficial. The isoflavones and polyphenols in chickpeas may help prevent osteoporosis by supporting bone metabolism and reducing inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Palinski-Wade explains that these mechanisms are especially helpful and relevant for women post-menopause, who are most at risk for bone loss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A handful of pistachios daily can help to improve intake of fiber and key nutrients, including healthy fats, protein and antioxidants, like lutein, which helps &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-protect-your-vision-8773401" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protect vision&lt;/a&gt; and supports overall health with age,” says Palinksi-Wade, a consultant for American Pistachio Growers. Additionally, one small study found that eating 2 ounces of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-pistachios-regularly-8687923" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;pistachios daily&lt;/a&gt; for 4 months reduced oxidative damage and increased the gene expression of specific genes that may support the reversal of certain metabolic conditions that are more common with age, including insulin resistance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Plus, as a good source of plant-based protein and fiber, pistachios can help to boost satiety with only 160 calories per serving, which can be beneficial when working towards maintaining a healthy body weight,” adds Palinski-Wade.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Leafy greens like spinach, kale and collard greens are rich in vitamin K and folate, which help support brain health and may slow age-related cognitive decline,” says &lt;a href="https://alexandria-hardy-rdn.clientsecure.me/#about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alexandria Hardy RDN LDN&lt;/a&gt;. Diets high in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/leafy-green-packed-recipes-that-arent-salad-8619158" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;dark leafy greens&lt;/a&gt; have been associated with improved memory and overall cognitive function in older adults and may even help slow cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “These vegetables are rich in brain-supportive nutrients like phylloquinone, beta-carotene and vitamin E, which are thought to support learning and memory,” says Cassetty.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-cranberries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Cranberries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over 60% of older adults in the United States do not regularly eat dark leafy vegetables.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Certain medications, like blood thinners, require consistent intake of vitamin K, which is found in greens like spinach and kale. However, this doesn’t mean you need to avoid these vegetables completely. If you take blood thinners, or another medication that interacts with vitamin K, talk with a healthcare professional about how to safely incorporate leafy greens in your diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For older adults with difficulties chewing, Hardy recommends steaming, sautéing or pureeing greens rather than enjoying them raw. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cranberry-health-benefits-8726317" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cranberries&lt;/a&gt; are rich in anthocyanins and proanthocyanins—antioxiants that support numerous aspects of health, from your brain to your urinary tract. Anthocyanins in cranberries are responsible for their vibrant red color and play a key role in protecting and supporting brain cells.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Thanks to their antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, anthocyanins are being studied for their potential role in reducing the risk of brain disorders like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lauren Manaker MS, RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cranberries can also be helpful for preventing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962519/uti-bacteria-gut-health-new-research/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;urinary tract infections&lt;/a&gt; (UTIs). While both men and women can experience UTIs, it’s estimated that over 10% of women over age 65 and 30% of women 85 years and older have a UTI at least once a year.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “There are compounds in cranberries called proanthocyanidins (PACs), which have been shown to maintain urinary tract health,” says Manaker. These compounds help prevent bacteria from adhering to the walls of the urinary tract, which can help decrease infection rates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bone loss is one of the most common and dangerous side effects of aging. Luckily, eating to protect and maintain bone health can be both delicious and simple. “Prunes contain bioactive compounds that may help blunt bone loss, so they're another tool in your toolkit to support healthy aging,” says Cassetty. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In one study, postmenopausal women who ate 50 grams, or approximately 5–6 prunes, per day had reduced rates of total hip bone mineral density loss over 6 to 12 months, whereas women who did not eat prunes experienced increased fracture risk scores at 6 months.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Also noteworthy, this study had a 90% compliance rate, proving just how easy and simple it is to add &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/prunes-benefits-8694943" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prunes&lt;/a&gt; to your diet. The delicious sweet taste and jelly-like texture make them a welcome addition to salads, toast and smoothies—or just to enjoy by the handful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regularly backed up? The high fiber content of prunes can also help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-breakfast-foods-to-help-you-poop-that-arent-oatmeal-8708873" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ease constipation&lt;/a&gt; to make bathroom visits smoother (literally).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Just be sure to drink more water to minimize side effects associated with increased fiber intake, like gas and bloating.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What you put on your plate plays a key role in healthy aging, but it’s far from the only factor. The following strategies can help you feel your best now and support your health in the years to come. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a Regular Sleep Schedule&lt;/strong&gt;: Prioritize a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-if-you-dont-get-enough-sleep-11746534" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consistent sleep&lt;/a&gt; and wake routine, even on days when you don’t have anywhere to be, encourages Palinski-Wade. Regular sleep may be more important than duration, with some studies showing that people getting consistent sleep have a 20 to 48% lower risk of death from any cause than those with irregular sleep patterns.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep your body moving—and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026823/what-is-joyful-movement/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;make it enjoyable&lt;/a&gt;! “Find something you love, whether it's dancing, walking, gardening or yoga, and make it a regular part of your routine,” says Manaker. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Connection&lt;/strong&gt;: Research suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/loneliness-dementia-risk-study-8733921" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;loneliness&lt;/a&gt; and social isolation have a mortality risk similar to smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, physical inactivity and obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Make it a priority to stay connected with family and friends and consider joining a club or attending a fitness class once a week. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Your Mind Active&lt;/strong&gt;: Staying mentally engaged through learning, puzzles, strategic games and other activities can support &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-to-improve-your-memory-8415078" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; and cognition as you age. Researchers found that people under 75 who regularly participated in cognitively stimulating tasks and activities saw the greatest increases in cognitive function and memory.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aging well doesn’t have to mean overhauling your entire diet and lifestyle.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that several nutrients are linked with a lower risk of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These nutrients include vitamins and minerals that act as antioxidants, plus fiber.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High sugar intake was related to an increased risk of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As we age, it’s natural to become more forgetful. But when the occasional “Where did I leave my keys?” becomes forgetting loved ones’ names and your own address, it may be a sign of something more serious. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dementia is a general term for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7903274/7-sneaky-signs-you-could-have-cognitive-decline-according-to-experts/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;loss of memory&lt;/a&gt;, language, problem-solving and other thinking abilities, severe enough to interfere with everyday life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893378/these-13-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-alzheimers-according-to-a-new-study/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; is the most common type of dementia. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;dementia cases are expected to double&lt;/a&gt; by the year 2060. And the economic burden of unpaid dementia caregiving in the U.S. is expected to skyrocket from an average of $172 billion in 2020 to over $1.5 trillion by 2060.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And this doesn’t take into account the emotional toll on families, friends and caregivers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since there is currently no cure for dementia, taking &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/activity-to-limit-for-reduced-risk-dementia-8548330" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;preventative measures&lt;/a&gt; can be a wise move. Columbia University researchers wanted to know which nutrients were related to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lifestyle-factors-reduce-early-dementia-risk-new-study-8423035" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduced risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;—and which ones might increase the risk. They recently published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), an ongoing U.S. study conducted biennially since 1992 that includes adults 50 years and older. In 2013, food consumption and nutrition intake was collected from a subset of the HRS called the Healthcare and Nutrition Study (HCNS).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To evaluate diet, participants completed a food frequency questionnaire that asked how frequently they consumed 163 different foods and beverages over the past 12 months. From this, the research team calculated nutrient intake based on participants’ responses for 101 nutrients. Individual nutrients were assessed regarding their relationship to dementia. In addition, researchers calculated composite scores for some groups of nutrients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants’ cognitive abilities were assessed using two different methods. One method was via a telephone interview with participants and the other was via a proxy respondent. For the proxy method, someone close to the participant answered questions about the participant’s memory levels, limitations in instrumental activities of daily living and status of cognitive impairment. Researchers would use this information to look for associations between nutrient intake and dementia risk.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This current study included 6,280 HCNS participants who met the researchers’ criteria, which included full diet information and cognitive assessments. Researchers also adjusted for demographic information like age, race, sex, BMI, education level, smoking status, alcohol intake and physical activity.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After running statistical analyses, the results suggest that several nutrients were connected with a reduced risk of dementia. The five with the strongest association were:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Isorhamnetin, a type of flavonol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manganese, a mineral&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietary fiber&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beta-tocopherol and beta-tocotrienol, both forms of vitamin E&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study also adds to the mounting evidence that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-eating-too-much-sugar-11721349" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high sugar intake&lt;/a&gt; is linked with a higher risk of dementia.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; With that said, it also showed some controversial associations between some other nutrients and higher dementia risk. We say controversial because they conflict with previous research or add to mixed results. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, this study suggests a link between certain components in milk and an increased risk of dementia, including glycerophosphocholine and vitamin D, both of which have been shown to support brain health in other studies. Researchers note that more research needs to be done, and that it could be due to other components in the food, not necessarily these nutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study has several limitations. First, asking people to estimate how much they ate of certain foods over the last year leaves lots of room for bias, forgetfulness and guessing. Also, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7903274/7-sneaky-signs-you-could-have-cognitive-decline-according-to-experts/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cognitive abilities and dementia&lt;/a&gt; were not clinically evaluated, which also leaves room for bias. Lastly, researchers did not adjust for factors like genetics and environmental factors that play a role in dementia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Isorhamnetin is a flavonol found in fruits and vegetables, including onions, almonds, berries, cherries, pears, apples and green grapes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It’s also found in ginkgo biloba, an herb touted for its brain health benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You’ll find manganese in nuts, legumes, whole grains and leafy greens. Maple syrup and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7676558/what-is-maple-water-and-should-you-be-drinking-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maple water&lt;/a&gt; are also rich sources of this trace mineral. Manganese plays a role in many bodily processes, including metabolism and immunity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While it’s a mineral, manganese plays a dual role and acts like an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage from free radicals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like manganese, vitamin E also has antioxidant properties, protecting cells from damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Nuts, seeds, wheat germ, and sunflower and safflower oils are good sources of vitamin E. You’ll also get some in spinach and broccoli.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A whopping &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-fiber-should-you-be-eating-11752876" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nine out of 10 Americans&lt;/a&gt; don’t have enough fiber in their diets. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and legumes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re concerned that you’re not including enough of these nutrients in your day-to-day routine, consider shaking things up. An easy (and painless) way to do it is to swap out your typical snacks for nutrient-rich ones. For example, if you typically reach for chips, soda or a candy bar mid-afternoon, consider a handful of nuts and berries. Or how about some hummus and veggie sticks? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The MIND diet is a fusion of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, and is loaded with brain-healthy foods that are also good for your heart. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mind-diet-dementia-study-11748383" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;There is recent evidence&lt;/a&gt; that following this healthy eating pattern may reduce your risk of dementia by up to 25%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to food, physical activity, managing your stressors and getting plenty of quality sleep also influence brain health. And make sure you’re also spending time with loved ones, as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/loneliness-dementia-risk-study-8733921" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;loneliness has also been shown to increase dementia &lt;/a&gt;risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that certain nutrients, like vitamin E, manganese and isorhamnetin, all of which act like antioxidants, plus fiber, are linked with a lower risk of dementia. It also adds to existing evidence that high sugar intake may raise dementia risk. If possible, get these brain-protecting nutrients from food. If you have difficulty doing so, seek the advice of a registered dietitian or a healthcare professional who can help you integrate foods rich in these nutrients and determine if supplementation is a viable option for you.

&lt;p&gt;The unidentified resident returned from a recent trip to Europe with measles, becoming the state’s 15th case this year, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spike in measles cases in Colorado, the most the state has recorded in decades, comes after a deadly outbreak in Texas this year, and as other hot spots have emerged around the world for the highly contagious disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infected Boulder County resident was an adult who was fully vaccinated, health officials said. Two shots of the vaccine are about 97% effective in preventing infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health officials say people should monitor themselves for symptoms for 21 days — and consider avoiding public gatherings — if they visited the following exposure locations in Boulder and Denver:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RTD Flatiron Flyer between Denver and Boulder&lt;/strong&gt;, both ways, from 6:45 to 9:35 a.m. and 4:05 to 7:15 p.m. June 3, June 5 and June 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Building&lt;/strong&gt;, 1400 16th St., Denver, from 8 a.m. to 6:15 p.m. June 3-6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little Finch Coffee Shop&lt;/strong&gt;, 1490 16th St., Denver, from noon to 2:15 p.m. June 4 and June 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole Foods&lt;/strong&gt;, 1701 Wewatta St., Denver, from noon to 2:30 p.m. June 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosetta Hall&lt;/strong&gt;, 1109 Walnut St., Boulder, from 7:30 to 10:45 p.m. June 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms include a cough, runny nose, red eyes and a fever, with a red rash starting about four days after someone becomes contagious. People can begin to feel sick one to three weeks after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who feel ill after a possible exposure should call their health care provider or an urgent care center before seeking help, so the provider can reduce the risk the virus will spread to other patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado has recorded at least eight measles cases tied to Denver International Airport and a Turkish Airlines flight that landed there with a contagious passenger on May 13. Other cases have been confirmed in Denver, Pueblo and Archuleta County.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;In a typical year, Colorado has two or fewer measles cases. The last time the state recorded more than 10 in a year was in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

That much smaller Y chromosome carries the SRY gene, which is the switch for testis development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last 300 million years or so, this system has been working very well. Now, however, chatter in genetics circles hints that something is amiss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, the Y chromosome has been losing pieces of itself, and computer models suggest the last scraps could vanish in roughly 11 million years. This is no trivial matter, because what it holds – or drops – can sway everything from cancer risk to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mouse-with-two-dads-survives-to-adulthood-major-implications-for-same-sex-human-couples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;how future humans reproduce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would that erase men from the planet, or would life simply shrug and invent a new plan? Rodents on remote islands and subtle changes inside aging human &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blood-stem-cells-grown-in-the-lab-for-first-time-ever-leukemia-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bone marrow&lt;/a&gt; are now providing clues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One story shows how a mammal kept producing males after its Y disappeared entirely. The other warns how men already pay a price when some of their cells drift away from the chromosome during middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-y-chromosome-fade-away"&gt;Y chromosome fade away&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mothers-pass-down-x-chromosomes-that-accelerate-brain-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The X chromosome&lt;/a&gt; carries about 900 genes that do everything from wiring nerves to repairing DNA. Its partner, the Y, keeps only about 55. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparative work across mammals shows that, once our lineage split from the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-do-animals-balance-their-sex-chromosomes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;platypus&lt;/a&gt; some 166 million years ago, the Y began dropping about five genes every million years. Run that line forward, and the ledger hits zero in 11 million years – a geological heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most biologists once chalked that outcome up to hype. After all, many species never shed their sex chromosomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the idea gained traction when researchers found the Japanese spiny rat and a few mole vole species thriving today without any Y at all. Somehow, they had rewired the traditional circuit for making testes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rodents-changed-the-rules"&gt;Rodents changed the rules&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, scientists found a duplicated piece of DNA near a gene called &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/sox9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SOX9&lt;/a&gt; in the spiny rat. Usually, another gene (SRY) turns SOX9 on to make male traits develop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in this rat, the new DNA copy does that job on its own – even without a Y chromosome – so a genetically female animal (XX) can still develop as male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drop the fragment into lab mice and testes still form. Evolution, it seems, can lay a new cable when the old one burns out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That discovery hints that, should the human Y fizzle out one distant day, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/lifes-rules-natural-selection-change-significantly-often-daphnia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;natural selection&lt;/a&gt; could promote an alternative trigger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different populations might even settle on different triggers, eventually splitting into separate species that cannot interbreed. The idea sounds like science fiction, but the rodent reality shows it is genetically feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-y-chromosomes-and-men-s-health"&gt;Y chromosomes and men’s health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before any species-wide overhaul, countless men are already losing the Y chromosome cell by cell. Starting in their fifties, bone-marrow &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/living-mouse-created-with-stem-cells-that-predate-animals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; sometimes mis-segregate it during division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting white-blood-cell lineages, missing their Y, multiply quietly. By 80 years old, more than 40 percent of men carry sizable pockets of this “mosaic loss of Y” in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking 1,153 Swedish men in their seventies and eighties, researchers found that those with the loss died 5.5 years earlier, suffered more solid tumors and heart disease, and faced a seven-fold rise in Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Walsh of the &lt;a href="https://www.virginia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/a&gt; then bred mouse blood stem cells without the Y chromosome and transplanted them. The recipients developed fibrosis, failing hearts, and early death, showing the loss is the culprit, not a bystander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-direct-link-to-the-immune-system"&gt;Direct link to the immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gene on the Y chromosome called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7404" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UTY&lt;/a&gt; helps control the immune system. Without it, some immune cells stop working properly – one kind makes more scar tissue, and another becomes weaker, which helps cancer grow and spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice, tumors grow twice as fast without the Y. In men, bladder cancers missing the Y chromosome are more dangerous – except they respond better to a certain kind of cancer treatment called checkpoint inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The picture is complicated: a chromosome that underpins male development also tames inflammation and restrains tumors, yet its selective absence can make some drugs shine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicine and evolution rarely share the same bottom line. Natural selection prizes reproductive success over a lifetime, while clinicians care about the here and now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-offsetting-y-chromosome-loss"&gt;Offsetting Y chromosome loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/does-vaping-help-people-quit-smoking-cigarettes-new-study-breaks-it-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cigarette smoke&lt;/a&gt;, air pollution, and certain industrial chemicals add extra DNA damage and accelerate the Y chromosome loss. Kicking tobacco, breathing cleaner air, and limiting exposure to mutagens therefore rank as simple defenses – all it takes is willpower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General habits that slow genomic wear – regular exercise, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mediterranean-diet-may-be-a-fountain-of-youth-for-women/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mediterranean-style&lt;/a&gt; meals, and solid sleep – may also keep the Y chromosome in more cells for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antifibrotic drugs cleared for lung disease are being tested to blunt heart damage from the loss. Oncologists already use chromosome status in bladder tumors to steer checkpoint therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As single-cell sequencing gets cheaper, your physical exam might soon include a “Y-loss score” beside cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-do-we-go-from-here"&gt;Where do we go from here?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese spiny rat proves that mammals can reinvent the rulebook after the ‘puny little chromosome’ disappears. That prospect keeps evolutionary biologists buzzing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the rodent’s triumph offers little comfort to a 60-year-old man whose marrow has already shed Y in a third of his white-blood-cell army. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Species-level salvation and individual-level hazard can coexist. That dichotomy – long-term adaptability versus immediate personal cost – will likely guide both medical practice and evolutionary debate in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Y chromosome is quirky but crucial. It shapes male development, steadies immunity, and may also be plotting its own disappearance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the good news is that the practical advice is simple: dodge mutagens, stub out cigarettes, consider a mid-life test for loss, and keep an eye on new research as this chromosome writes its final chapters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go, men, you got this!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)00646-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 21:55:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPaHBHVUVBUVJoMU5NODVHOGRiMGhSZDBEd2Zrak5rYzVVX0lGOGNlMHloWlhBSGhzamRRZXJtS1M5cU9UM3RGSE9wM0NHWDRZYnZPR3dQRUZ0YVlyTFVqcVdSM0dEUGxpT25LMFh5N2tPVGZDUGp1elJmYjZXMnQybTR4NlJUd3k2d2tnbDloN3Y5TVR1XzZ6bWg0cjM</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，这种日常习惯可以将慢性背痛风险降低23 ％ - EatingWell | This Daily Habit May Lower Chronic Back Pain Risk by 23%, New Study Says - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE5tNjc5dFBQZUFiRTlRLVZCaWpPekt0V2wwaXRwR3Rqby1YeHNsd01laG9Tbk5jV2U3OGc2eTc3a1g4VVZzTGMwell3SUxrUXg5LUJqWWpGWW1TT1pPWHZyUU1UZFpJb0hqYUdj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lower back pain is a not-so-gentle reminder that we’re human, not indestructible machines. It can rear its ugly head after you’ve lifted something heavy or spent hours in a chair that feels like it belongs in medieval times. Sometimes it’s a dull ache, other times it’s a sharp jab, and occasionally it’s that frustrating combo of both. Unfortunately, lower back pain is a common issue that affects people of all ages and is a leading cause of discomfort and disability worldwide.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It is one of the primary causes of ongoing pain and contributes to significant health care costs, especially in the U.S.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not to mention, it is a very uncomfortable thing to experience.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To address lower back pain, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-every-day-study-11707905" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;staying physically active&lt;/a&gt; is often recommended, yet there's no clear advice on whether specific activities, like walking, can help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/walking-can-decrease-back-pain-episodes-8669356" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduce annoying aches&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While some studies show that exercise like strength training and stretching may help reduce the risk of lower back pain, research is still limited regarding the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-walking-a-good-enough-form-of-exercise-11743962" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;benefits of walking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This has led researchers to explore whether walking more each day—or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/walking-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them-7158418" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;walking at a faster pace&lt;/a&gt;—might lower the chances of developing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-30-day-walking-plan-for-back-pain-8707216" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;chronic lower back pain&lt;/a&gt;, and the results were published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study looked at information from a large health project in Norway called the Trøndelag Health (HUNT) Study. More than 56,000 individuals were evaluated, and subjects came in for health checks and answered questions about their lifestyle and health between 2017 and 2019 to obtain baseline information. Later, between 2021 and 2023, these participants were invited to a follow-up study focused on COVID-19, and about 60% of them took part. Certain individuals were removed from the study to ensure accurate results, such as those missing specific data or already having chronic lower back pain. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In what was called the HUNT4 study, 31,295 participants wore two small motion-tracking devices called accelerometers for a week to measure their physical activity. One device was placed on the thigh, and the other on the lower back. These devices tracked different types of movements and postures in short 5-second intervals. Walking was categorized into three types based on speed: slow, moderate and brisk. Days with no recorded activity, like sitting or walking, were excluded. The study calculated how much time participants spent walking each day on average, as well as their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/add-six-hours-longevity-study-8754775" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;walking intensity&lt;/a&gt;, which was based on how much energy different walking speeds required.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chronic lower back pain was evaluated using a simple set of questions. Participants were asked if they had experienced pain or stiffness in their muscles or joints lasting at least three months in the past year. If they said yes, they were then asked to specify where they felt the pain or stiffness. Those who indicated that the pain was in their lower back were classified as having chronic lower back pain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Results showed that people who walked more each day had a lower risk of developing chronic lower back pain. Those who walked for at least 78 minutes daily saw a reduced risk, with the greatest benefit observed in those walking 125 minutes or more per day. Specifically, compared with walking less than 78 minutes per day, those who walked more than 100 minutes per day had a 23% reduced risk of chronic lower back pain. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This effect was even stronger and more consistent in individuals aged 65 and older when compared to younger people. Additionally, walking at a faster pace or higher intensity led to similar benefits, showing that individuals with a brisk walking intensity also experienced a reduced risk of back pain. These findings did not differ based on gender or other factors like age when considering walking intensity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For individuals walking less than the highest daily volume (under 125 minutes per day), the risk of chronic lower back pain decreased when their walking intensity was higher than 3.00 MET per minute. MET refers to the metabolic equivalent of task— However, for those walking the most (125 minutes or more daily), this relationship was less clear. Interestingly, the impact of walking intensity on chronic lower back pain risk appeared consistent across all levels of daily walking volume. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The relationship between how much you walk each day and your risk of developing chronic lower back pain isn’t straightforward. Generally, walking more reduces your risk, with the biggest benefits seen when walking up to about 100 minutes per day. If you walk more than that, the risk continues to decrease but at a slower rate. Similarly, the intensity of walking matters to some extent. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walking at a moderate pace was linked to a lower risk of lower back pain, and walking faster didn’t necessarily add more benefits—in fact, it may slightly increase the risk. These findings suggest that both the amount and the intensity of daily walking play roles in reducing the risk of chronic lower back pain, but the benefits vary depending on how much and how fast you walk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When interpreting the results of this study, it's important to consider a few key limitations. Firstly, the researchers only measured daily walking and intensity over a short period, which may not capture changes over time. It’s also worth noting that this study is observational, so we can’t say for sure if certain walking habits cause lower back pain or are just associated with it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, there might still be some unaccounted influences the researchers couldn’t fully control for, but this analysis suggests these wouldn’t drastically affect the results. Lastly, participants were asked to recall their back pain over the past year, which might lead to some inaccuracies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're someone who experiences occasional back discomfort or wants to reduce the risk of chronic lower back pain, walking might be one of the simplest and most practical solutions to incorporate into your routine. For many, walking is a low-impact and accessible activity that doesn’t require any special equipment or gym membership. Whether it’s a brisk walk around your neighborhood, a stroll through a local park or running errands on foot, making walking a daily habit could contribute to better back health over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The great thing about the findings from this study is how achievable these goals are for everyday people. Even walking for around 100 minutes a day may make a noticeable difference, and you don’t have to do it all at once; breaking it into smaller walks throughout the day works just as well. Additionally, picking up the pace occasionally or including some brisk walking may enhance the benefits. Walking not only helps with back health but also supports overall well-being, from &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-activity-for-heart-health-recommended-by-cardiologist-8419619" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improving cardiovascular fitness&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024858/walking-plan-to-reduce-stress/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reducing stress&lt;/a&gt;. Small changes like opting to take the stairs, parking farther away or taking walking breaks during your day may help make a big difference in the long term.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recent study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt; offers insights into the potential benefits of walking for reducing the risk of chronic lower back pain . By analyzing data from over 31,000 participants, researchers found that walking more each day (particularly up to 125 minutes) is linked to a lower risk of developing chronic lower back pain. Walking intensity also plays a role, with moderate to brisk walking showing added benefits for those not already walking the most. These findings are especially promising for older adults, as they seemed to experience the most consistent reductions in risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, the takeaway is clear: regular walking, whether done in small increments or longer bouts, is an accessible and effective way to support back health. This aligns with walking's broader benefits for overall physical and mental well-being, making it an ideal activity for people of all ages and fitness levels. Although intensity and duration both matter, even modest increases in daily walking habits can make a difference.&lt;br&gt;

Using brain-wide recordings in preclinical models, scientists observed that autism-linked mutations affected how expectations are updated during decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These models relied more heavily on frontal brain regions and less on sensory input, struggling to distinguish between predictable and unpredictable stimuli.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using brain-recording technology, the research team observed neurons across the entire brain to explore whether different genetic forms of autism share patterns and establish commonalities in neural responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that, despite genetic differences, various forms may show a similar unique pattern of brain activity — also known as a brain signature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this research will serve as a stepping stone linking genetic differences and behavioral atypicalities,” said Jean-Paul Noel, PhD, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that preclinical models with autism-linked genetic mutations struggled to adjust their expectations —or their predicted state of the world in the immediate future — based on new information when making decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike typical models that could update their expectations more flexibly, they relied more heavily on the front part of the brain and less on sensory areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, their brains focused more on long-term expectation differences, but their sensory systems had trouble distinguishing between predictable and unpredictable sensory stimuli. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The particular circuit this research uncovered appears to drive behavioral anomalies in all three preclinical models of autism tested. This feedback projection from frontal areas to visual cortex will be studied in more detail in subsequent projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was supported by grants from the Wellcome Trust, Simons Foundation, National Institutes of Health [grant R00NS128075], a Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative Pilot Grant, the University of Minnesota Clinical and Translational Science Institute and a Sloan Research fellowship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and Autism research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f899d58b95918c90b88d9596d69d9c8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alexandra Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://umn.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Alexandra Smith – University of Minnesota&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01965-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A common computational and neural anomaly across mouse models of autism&lt;/a&gt;” by Jean-Paul Noel et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A common computational and neural anomaly across mouse models of autism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computational psychiatry studies suggest that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) inflexibly update their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we leveraged high-yield rodent psychophysics, extensive behavioral modeling and brain-wide single-cell extracellular recordings to assess whether mice with different genetic perturbations associated with ASD show this same computational anomaly, and if so, what neurophysiological features are shared across genotypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice harboring mutations in &lt;em&gt;Fmr1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cntnap2&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Shank3B&lt;/em&gt; show a blunted update of priors during decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with mice that flexibly updated their priors, inflexible updating of priors was associated with a shift in the weighting of prior encoding from sensory to frontal cortices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, frontal areas in mouse models of ASD showed more units encoding deviations from the animals’ long-run prior, and sensory responses did not differentiate between expected and unexpected observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that distinct genetic instantiations of ASD may yield common neurophysiological and behavioral phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

            A document the Department of Health and Human Services sent to lawmakers to support Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to change U.S. policy on covid vaccines cites scientific studies that are unpublished or under dispute and mischaracterizes others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k00073b6mvrtqb6hu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One health expert called the document “willful medical disinformation” about the safety of covid vaccines for children and pregnant women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It is so far out of left field that I find it insulting to our members of Congress that they would actually give them something like this. Congress members are relying on these agencies to provide them with valid information, and it’s just not there,” said &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/mark-turrentine-32066" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Turrentine&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Kennedy, who was an anti-vaccine activist before taking a role in the Trump administration, announced May 27 that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would no longer recommend covid vaccines for pregnant women or healthy children, bypassing the agency’s formal process for adjusting its vaccine schedules for adults and kids. The announcement, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;made on the social platform X&lt;/a&gt;, has been met with outrage by many pediatricians and scientists.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000a3b6mg2m7wl26@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The HHS document meant to support Kennedy’s decision, obtained by KFF Health News, was sent to members of Congress who questioned the science and process behind his move, according to one federal official who asked not to be identified because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000b3b6mxulzu6ne@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The document has not been posted on the HHS website, though it is the first detailed explanation of Kennedy’s announcement from the agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000c3b6m9b37tiyv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Titled “Covid Recommendation FAQ,” the document distorts some legitimate studies and cites others that are disputed and unpublished, medical experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000g3b6m5v89pkhu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS director of communications Andrew Nixon told KFF Health News, “There is no distortion of the studies in this document. The underlying data speaks for itself, and it raises legitimate safety concerns. HHS will not ignore that evidence or downplay it. We will follow the data and the science.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            HHS did not respond to a request to name the author of the document.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “This is RFK Jr.’s playbook,” said &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/accords/about/faculty-staff-directory/O-Leary-Sean-UCD11631" target="_blank"&gt;Sean O’Leary&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “Either cherry-pick from good science or take junk science to support his premise — this has been his playbook for 20 years.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Another &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.20.24306810v1" target="_blank"&gt;study cited&lt;/a&gt; in the document is a preprint that has not been peer-reviewed. Under the study’s title is an alert that “it reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice.” Though the preprint was made available a year ago, it has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000l3b6mexy48umn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FAQ supporting Kennedy’s decision claims that “post-marketing studies” of covid vaccines have identified “serious adverse effects, such as an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis” — conditions in which the heart’s muscle or its covering, the pericardium, suffer inflammation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000m3b6mytcf69j1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            False claims that the 2024 preprint showed myocarditis and pericarditis only in people who received a covid vaccine, and not in people infected with covid, circulated on social media. One of the &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/08/08/myocarditis-vaccinated-covid-19-oxford-fact-check/74639942007/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank"&gt;study’s co-authors&lt;/a&gt; publicly rejected that idea, because the study did not compare outcomes between people who were vaccinated and those infected with the covid virus. The study also focused only on children and adolescents. The HHS document omitted numerous &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39826014/" target="_blank"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39404761/" target="_blank"&gt;peer-reviewed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35993236/" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that have shown that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is greater after contracting covid for both vaccinated and non-vaccinated people than the risk of the same complications after vaccination alone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000n3b6m5va2ty2o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            O’Leary said that while some cases of myocarditis were reported in vaccinated adolescent boys and young men early in the covid pandemic, the rates declined after the two initial doses of covid vaccines were spaced further apart.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000o3b6m8x16x1hx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, adolescents and adults who have not been previously vaccinated receive only one shot, and myocarditis no longer shows up in the data, O’Leary said, referring to the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety-systems/vsd/index.html#cdc_generic_section_5-access-and-use-vsd-data" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine Safety Datalink&lt;/a&gt;. “There is no increased risk at this point that we can identify,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In two instances, the HHS memo makes claims that are &lt;a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.17721" target="_blank"&gt;actively refuted&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/fulltext/2022/04000/in_vitro_fertilization_and_early_pregnancy.3.aspx%C2%A0" target="_blank"&gt;the papers&lt;/a&gt; it cites to back them up. Both papers support the safety and effectiveness of covid vaccines for pregnant women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000q3b6msjgjfu62@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The HHS document says that another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X24001270?via%3Dihub#s0090" target="_blank"&gt;paper it cites&lt;/a&gt; found “an increase in placental blood clotting in pregnant mothers who took the vaccine.” But the paper doesn’t contain any reference to placental blood clots or to pregnant women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000r3b6m8l7lpzj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve now read it three times. And I cannot find that anywhere,” said Turrentine, the OB-GYN professor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If he were grading the HHS document, “I would give this an ‘F,’” Turrentine said. “This is not supported by anything and it’s not using medical evidence.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000t3b6mahkdmtpe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While members of Congress who are physicians should know to check references in the paper, they may not take the time to do so, said &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/neil-silverman" target="_blank"&gt;Neil Silverman,&lt;/a&gt; a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology who directs the Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy Program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. “They’re going to assume this is coming from a scientific agency. So they are being hoodwinked along with everyone else who has had access to this document,” Silverman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The offices of three Republicans in Congress who are medical doctors serving on House and Senate committees focused on health, including Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), did not respond to requests for comment about whether they received the memo. Emily Druckman, communications director for Rep. Kim Schrier (D-Wash.), a physician serving on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Schrier’s office did receive a copy of the document.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000v3b6m04p2ohkp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The problem is a lot of legislators and even their staffers, they don’t have the expertise to be able to pick those references apart,” O’Leary said. “But this one — I’ve seen much better anti-vaccine propaganda than this, frankly.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000w3b6mwahzdy4o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            C.J. Young, deputy communications director for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Democratic staff members of the committee received the document from HHS. In the past, he said, similar documents would help clarify the justification and scope of an administration’s policy change and could be assumed to be scientifically accurate, Young said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000x3b6mxxuyaefn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This feels like it’s breaking new ground. I don’t think that we saw this level of sloppiness or inattention to detail or lack of consideration for scientific merit under the first Trump administration,” Young said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000y3b6m683xobr4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On June 4, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) and Schrier &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/119/bills/hr3701/BILLS-119hr3701ih.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would require Kennedy to adopt official vaccine decisions from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. Young said the motivation behind the bill was Kennedy’s decision to change the covid vaccine schedule without the input of ACIP’s vaccine experts, who play a key role in setting CDC policies around vaccine schedules and access.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000z3b6mkvy7hltk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy announced June 9 on X that he would remove all 17 members of ACIP, citing alleged conflicts of interest he did not detail, and replace them. He announced eight replacements June 11, including people who had criticized vaccine mandates during the covid pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

I asked if he could feel it, if he was doing anything to make it twitch, but he said no,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spasms progressed for Albaladejo and he soon experienced arm weakness, difficulty gripping things, and high blood pressure, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.newsweek.com/silly-little-symptom-leads-als-diagnosis-2083556?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawK5DRlleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFNUG40ZWN2eG9uVmJDSFFzAR4GYdlcSt9DsIH1gC5T3EZCSbd3f9-elZ3QsLIAmEvjc_Me_P2lo0dGdQHBeA_aem_BmKQCgWPBSYsySYL3Yg2tA#Echobox=1749744873" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Newsweek;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; reported. Within months, doctors diagnosed him with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease, a condition that causes progressive &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354022" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:loss of muscle control;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;loss of muscle control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was heartbroken when I heard the news, like my life was being taken from me piece by piece – I still have so much of me to give,” he told DM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hearing the diagnosis was devastating, we were in complete shock,” Carmen said to Newsweek. “Sitting in that doctor's office, the weight of it all hit us at once. We broke down in tears. It was one of the hardest moments of our lives, filled with fear, sorrow, and so many unanswered questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Physical therapy (stock photo).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALS symptoms can include difficulty walking, tripping, and slurred speech, among others, and it often first appears in the hands, feet, arms, or legs, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354022" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. There is no cure, but medical treatment can slow the disease's progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life changed in an instant for Albaladejo, who used to work as a school resource officer, and he worried about his family’s future, including his 11-year-old daughter Sophia. He was 39 years old when he received the diagnosis in late 2023, according to Newsweek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm angry that I won't be here to see my little girl grow into the smart, kind, and beautiful woman I know she will be. I think that hurts the most,” Albaladejo said. “Instead, she has to watch me fall apart in front of her eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he wants to leave a legacy she can be proud of.  “I just hope that throughout all of this, my daughter still sees me as her hero, as I face this disease with determination and strength,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily life in Tampa has shifted drastically for the couple, who &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@calbaladej0/photo/7402335127734390062" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:started dating;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;started dating&lt;/a&gt; when they were teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In eight months, our lives completely changed. We thought it was nerve compression, and now Albaladejo has a terminal illness with a prognosis of two to five years,” Carmen told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per Newsweek, Albaladejo relies on a wheelchair to get around and Carmen has become her husband’s primary caregiver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To see someone go from being completely independent to nearly fully dependent in under two years is truly heartbreaking," she told Newsweek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carmen has been documenting the &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@calbaladej0/video/7514004486549998894" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:family’s journey on TikTok;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;family’s journey on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; and Albaladejo’s sister started a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-andres-albaladejos-fight-against-als?utm_campaign=fp_ss_icons_ai&amp;amp;utm_content=amp1v3&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; that has already raised more than $26,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a cruel condition that robs a person of their vitality, strength and mobility,” Carmen wrote online in 2024. “It’s been a rough year for us and even through it all, we still do what we can to just live life every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there’s no cure, the Albaladejo family is pressing forward as best they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this point, we are getting our affairs in order, as we cannot see any promising treatments we can afford,” Carmen told the Daily Mail. “We are trying to stay strong and make the best out of our situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/florida-father-has-1-minor-symptom-before-he-s-given-2-years-to-live-11754248" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 18:35:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFBwVjRpODQtc2RRdlJEbXNNQ2taWEM1OG9xb0V4bW13NXIzWDM3OE1YYUlsdTB1Qm9PYnh1eUlnMjVQYVpsamlsRVZTQWpWeWM0MlRFWVpUbGxkcXF2WlV3eTJRRkY0cVExWlBITA</guid></item><item><title>科学家们精确地指出了检查您是否会患上早发性结肠癌的方法，准确率高达92 ％ -每日邮报 | Scientists pinpoint way to check if you're going to get early-onset colon cancer with up to 92% accuracy - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A little-known at-home test can detect early-onset colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-5395ccd0-485d-11f0-a3cb-3b7d494b4c7b"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; before symptoms develop, increasing the chance of surviving a disease that is surging among young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) costs $49 and screens a person's feces for flecks of blood, a warning sign of the cancer — as tumors cause bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The test is FDA-approved and allows younger people a chance to screen for colon cancer before they reach the recommended age for a colonoscopy, 45 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If blood is detected, a colonoscopy is performed, increasing the chances of catching colon cancer early when it is more treatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the American College of Surgeons says it is generally accurate, able to detect about 80 percent of all cases. If someone opts for the $600 FIT with DNA screening, which checks for abnormal changes in cells' DNA, accuracy rises to 92 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A colonoscopy is about 99 percent accurate at detecting all cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent study found people that use the FIT method between the ages of 40 to 49 years old are 39 percent less likely to die from colon cancer than their peers who wait to get the test until they are 50 years old or above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An increasing number of younger people are seeking screening, as the US experiences a&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14797635/colon-cancer-young-people-symptoms.html"&gt;surge in colon cancer among people under 50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, with young patients today about twice as likely to be diagnosed with the disease than their grandparents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is Christine Bronstein who was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 48 years after taking an at-home stool-based test for the disease. She said without the test, her cancer may have gone unnoticed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rising rates are prompting some physicians to urge Americans to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14766779/colon-cancer-screening-age-lowered-cases-surge.html"&gt;start getting screened for the disease &lt;/a&gt;before the age of 45 years, which is when US doctors recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the test, which can be ordered online, customers are sent a package containing a collection tube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are asked to collect a sample of their feces from the toilet bowl, place it in the tube and mail it to a lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results take about five days to come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the lab, scientists expose the feces to antibodies that can bind to human hemoglobin - a protein found in red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If they bind to an area of the feces, a positive test result is issued - and patients are advised to undertake further screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the FIT with DNA, scientists also analyze cells found in the stool for abnormal changes - which could indicate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients over 45 years old who have an average risk — meaning no family history of the disease — may be recommended the test, which is free for the group under health insurance plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But people can also buy the test, which is sold by labs like Everlywell for $49, or opt for other tests like Cologuard, which is priced at $121.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the test can be extremely helpful, doctors caution that about five to 10 percent of patients who get a positive result do not have colon cancer or advanced polyps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of false positives after a colonoscopy is below one percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is important to follow up with a doctor to discuss results.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors diagnosed her with stage three cancer following the test, and a two-inch tumor was found in her rectum. She underwent chemotherapy to shrink her tumor (shown above) before doctors said they would remove it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is a stock image of the FIT, which involves sending a sample of feces off to a lab&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients undertaking the test are recommended to do it every year, as this can help to catch early-onset cancers which are typically slower growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among patients to have their cancer caught after using an at-home stool-based test is Christine Bronstein, who was diagnosed with the cancer at age 48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Hawaii local exercises regularly, and avoids sugar and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after seeing blood in her stool in 2021, she became concerned and ordered a stool-based test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After results came back positive, she rushed to see her doctor and was eventually approved for a colonoscopy - which led to a stage three colon cancer diagnosis with a two-inch tumor found in her rectum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bronstein told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.today.com/health/health/colorectal-cancer-survivor-home-test-rcna25564"&gt;TODAY&lt;/a&gt;: 'I'm very lucky that I did my test when I did. This thing really takes people down right in their prime... I think the problem why this is becoming the No.1 killer for younger people is because their symptoms get denied.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer cases are surging among under-50s in the US in an uptick that has stunned researchers, with adults born in the 1980s having double the risk of suffering from the cancer compared to their parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among adults aged 25 to 29 years, colon cancer cancer rates have spiked 85 percent in two decades according to CDC data. At the same time, over the last 30 years cases have dropped among over-50s by 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

However, sun exposure carries a risk of skin cancer, and experts recommend getting vitamin D through diet or supplements instead.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're using sunscreen and plan to be outside anyway, brief sun exposure may help with vitamin D production. Research shows that about 10 minutes of midday sun with 25% of the body exposed—such as the arms and legs—can meet daily vitamin D needs during spring and summer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The sun is not a dependable source to ensure you have enough vitamin D,” &lt;a href="https://mdinseattle.com/about-modern-dermatology/our-physicians/heather-d-rogers-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Heather D. Rogers, MD,&lt;/a&gt; a dermatologist in Seattle, told Verywell. “The safest and most consistent way to get adequate vitamin D is through your diet—eating &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-d-8348470" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin D–rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, choosing fortified options, and using supplements as needed.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although experts advise against relying on sun exposure for all your vitamin D needs, this doesn't mean you should avoid sunlight altogether. Even with sunscreen, your body may still produce some vitamin D. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Not having enough sun exposure can contribute to increased anxiety, depression, cognitive decline, and greater difficulty managing everyday stressors,” said &lt;a href="https://dignuswellness.com/AboutMe" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samia Estrada, PsyD&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist based in Vacaville, CA. “Getting sun while also exercising has been found to have a favorable impact on stress management.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D’s primary role is to help the body absorb calcium from the intestines, which helps strengthen your bones, said &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/karl-insogna/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Karl Insogna, MD,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;director of the Yale Bone Center at Yale Medicine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Insgona said both &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-d-two-vs-d-three-7095309" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D2 and D3&lt;/a&gt; naturally occur in foods such as salmon, tuna, mackerel, beef liver, and egg yolks. But because most people don’t eat enough of these foods, many products—including milk, certain cereals, and some orange juice brands—have been fortified with vitamin D.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is measured in international units (IU). The &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/new-guidelines-supplemental-vitamin-d-8666125" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;recommended daily intake&lt;/a&gt; is 600 IU for ages 1 to 70, and 800 IU for those 71 and older.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the National Institutes of Health, most people in the United States have adequate blood levels of vitamin D, but about 25% do not. As you age, your skin becomes less efficient at producing vitamin D, which may increase your need for supplements or vitamin D–rich foods.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently states that there isn’t enough evidence to recommend for or against routine vitamin D testing in people without symptoms of a deficiency.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The program aims to offer therapeutic support in a safe, medically supervised setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now open to the public following a soft launch earlier this year, this &lt;a href="https://ambio.life/personal-change/ibogaine-regeneration/"&gt;neuroregenerative program&lt;/a&gt; is designed for patients considering ibogaine as part of their care strategy. It has already treated 30 patients in a dedicated treatment facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to MS, the program is available for people with &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/what-is-als/"&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and other conditions. The goal is to explore ibogaine as a potential supportive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re creating a safe, structured environment for people with these conditions to explore ibogaine, and we could be on the cusp of uncovering how ibogaine may support brain healing in ways we don’t fully understand today,” Jonathan Dickinson, Ambio’s CEO and co-founder, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/06/09/3095856/0/en/Ambio-Life-Sciences-Launches-World-s-First-Clinical-Ibogaine-Program-for-Patients-With-Neurodegenerative-Conditions.html"&gt;company press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Lesion volume reduced, symptoms eased in 2 patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, damage to the brain and spinal cord results in a wide range of symptoms, including vision problems, poor coordination and balance, fatigue, and pain. Available treatments can prevent new damage from occurring and slow down the progression of disease, but they generally cannot help patients regain lost functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibogaine, currently illegal in the U.S., is a psychedelic found in the root bark of the African iboga plant. It works by acting on receptors — for example, NMDA and opioid receptors — that play a role in brain activity. Ibogaine also increases the production of molecules that help nerve cells survive and form new connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;As both a clinician and an MS patient, I’ve experienced the complexity of these conditions and the limitations of traditional treatments. The relief some patients are reporting so far is motivating, including improvements in eyesight, mobility, and neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1535782/full"&gt;recent report&lt;/a&gt;, ibogaine reduced lesion volume and eased symptoms of MS in two patients — one with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing–remitting MS&lt;/a&gt; and the other with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/secondary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-spms/"&gt;secondary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt;. Following treatment, both patients also showed signs of improvement on brain scans suggestive of new connections between nerve cells and rewiring of brain circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As both a clinician and an MS patient, I’ve experienced the complexity of these conditions and the limitations of traditional treatments,” Lyndsey Ryan, Ambio’s chief therapy officer, said. “The relief some patients are reporting so far is motivating, including improvements in eyesight, mobility, and neuropathic pain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ambio’s program, a loading dosing is optimized for tolerability, followed by extended microdosing (taking very small doses). Weekly group sessions offer ongoing support through and beyond the treatment period. In addition to providing safe access to ibogaine, the company will also collect real-world data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the program does not promise a cure, it gives patients a chance to participate in an emerging therapy that could support better quality of life and provide insights for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Every participant is helping us learn what’s possible,” said Ryan, who is also the program’s lead therapist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Ibogaine relived ‘MS hug’ for patient&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Country music artist Clay Walker and NFL Hall of Famer Brett Favre were among the first to try the program. Both were diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases — Walker with MS in 1996, and Favre with Parkinson’s in early 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was told about ibogaine from a friend who completed the treatment and was blown away by the results,” said Favre. “Since coming to Ambio, I’ve felt a real shift, especially in my sleep and energy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walker shared a similar experience. “My journey with ibogaine was extraordinary,” Walker said. “It relieved what we call the ‘&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/the-ms-hug/"&gt;MS hug&lt;/a&gt;,’ that painful tightness in the abdomen, and gave me clarity, focus, and real relief from stress. My hope is that ibogaine can one day complement the treatments MS patients already rely on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambio is working with Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, to explore how ibogaine works in people with neurodegenerative diseases, namely how it impacts biomarkers of neuroinflammation and disease models of Parkinson’s, MS, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This work may help define what ibogaine treatments for neurodegenerative diseases could look like in the future,” Dickinson said. “Even if we don’t fully know what shape that will take yet, preclinical research and each patient’s experience brings us closer to understanding how ibogaine may support neurorepair.”&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a commonly prescribed stimulant that Declan had been taking for years. As Sarah tells PEOPLE, her husband, David, was about to give him the medication, which they’d picked up from Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacy in Comox, B.C., on May 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's very chaotic in the morning, and if my husband had just been distracted with the other two, or been tired from being up with the baby the night before, this could have ended totally differently," Sarah, who has a 3-year-old and 10-month-old, tells PEOPLE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty; Joe Amon/The Denver Post via Getty&lt;/p&gt; (Left:) Dextroamphetamine; (Right:) Hydromorphone&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when David looked at the bottle, and realized he was holding someone else’s prescription — and it was for hydromorphone.

&lt;p&gt;Dental implants have gotten much better, but they still just sit there, in your mouth, like polished pegs. Your real teeth — you can feel them chatter, grind, and push onto stuff. When you chew, you feel it with your tiny nerve endings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, this sensory feedback — known as dental proprioception — has been lost to implants. Until now. A team from Tufts University has just unveiled a bioengineered dental implant that doesn’t just fill the gap but also blends in with your sensory connections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1024x819.webp 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1536x1229.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-2048x1639.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-750x600.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1140x912.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" type="image/webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1024x819.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1024x819.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1536x1229.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-2048x1639.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-750x600.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1140x912.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" class="wp-image-285357 sp-no-webp" alt="teeth" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async"&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Teeth implants could use stem cells and connect to nerve endings inside your mouth. Image credits: Kamal Hoseinianzade.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, let’s get something straight: traditional implants are mechanical marvels. Typically made of titanium and topped with ceramic, they’re surgically anchored directly into your jawbone. Once healed, they stay put for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But here’s the problem: in anchoring directly to the bone, implants bypass the soft tissue that naturally connects real teeth to your jaw. That soft tissue — the periodontal ligament — is loaded with nerve endings. It lets you feel the difference between a walnut and a jellybean. Lose it, and you lose that whisper of feedback that makes chewing precise and speech fluid. It’s a bit like having &lt;a data-wpil-monitor-id="2305" href="https://www.zmescience.com/future/ai-headphones-focusing/"&gt;noise-cancelling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers want to bring back the feel of &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/researchers-develop-new-coating-that-could-remove-teeth-stains-more-effectively/"&gt;real teeth&lt;/a&gt; with a new generation of implants. They’ve designed an implant wrapped in a biodegradable, memory-foam-like nanofiber coating. Inside that coating are stem cells and a potent growth protein (FGF-2). This protein nudges those cells to become nerve tissue and directs the implant to grow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea is to re-create the missing nerve link — the feedback loop that once kept your bite in sync. But the team didn’t stop at making the implant feel more natural. They changed how it’s installed, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-changing-dental-implants"&gt;Changing dental implants&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional implants require drilling into the jawbone — a procedure that is painful, can damage nerves, and takes months to fully heal. The Tufts implant, by contrast, uses a “press-fit” technique. Think of it like inserting a memory foam plug: it goes in smaller than the space it’s meant to fill, then slowly expands to snugly match the contours of the socket. You don’t need any drills and there’s less trauma involved with the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, the method has only been tested on rats, not on humans. Six weeks after the implants were installed, they were still secure and showed no sign of rejection. &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/how-water-filters-age/" data-wpil-monitor-id="2304"&gt;Micro-CT scans&lt;/a&gt; showed that a tiny, uniform gap (0.7–0.9 mm) exists between the implant and the surrounding bone. Instead of fusing directly to bone like traditional implants, these sit within a soft-tissue pocket. That’s the magic: that soft-tissue layer is where the nerve connections are expected to grow back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step is to see if those newly grown nerves actually &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; — by measuring &lt;a data-wpil-monitor-id="2303" href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/brain-solves-problems-when-we-daydream/"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt; in response to bite pressure or temperature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If that checks out, the team plans to move on to larger animal models — likely pigs or dogs, which have more &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/fossil-friday-the-story-of-how-tusks-evolved-from-teeth/"&gt;human-like teeth&lt;/a&gt; — and eventually clinical trials in humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-game-changer-for-dentistry"&gt;A game changer for dentistry&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Don’t expect to see this technology pop up at a dentist near you in a year or two. But if this does work, it could be a game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 178 million Americans are missing at least one tooth. By 2026, nearly a quarter of the U.S. population is expected to have at least one dental implant. Worldwide, the implant industry is projected to top $13 billion. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These new implants are not just about comfort, either. Without proprioception, patients often bite harder than they need to, risking fractures or jaw issues. Subtle speech changes can occur. The feedback loop between jaw muscles, teeth, and brain is broken. And we’re only beginning to understand how that affects digestion, eating behavior, and long-term oral health. Some researchers even link impaired oral sensation to changes in brain regions tied to speech, swallowing, and memory. It’s a frontier in neuroscience and prosthodontics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only exciting discovery in the field. In Japan, researchers &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/the-first-drug-that-regrows-teeth-is-about-to-enter-clinical-trials/"&gt;have made progress&lt;/a&gt; on regrowing human teeth. Another approach aims to &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/human-like-teeth-grown-in-pigs-could-make-dental-implants-a-thing-of-the-past/"&gt;regrow human teeth in pigs&lt;/a&gt;. But these approaches will take quite some time to develop as well, if they turn out to be successful at all. In the meantime, it looks like we’ll still be using implants for some time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These implants may soon become much more than just plumbing and scaffolding. They will be part of a sensing, communicating, adapting system. This smart implant doesn’t just restore function — it tries to connect an implant to the body. Literally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-99923-8"&gt;was published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The compound, called JRT, showed strong potential to promote brain cell growth and reverse damage linked to conditions like schizophrenia. In animal experiments, JRT improved symptoms without triggering behaviors associated with hallucinations. The findings were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2416106122" target="_blank"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD, is best known for its powerful mind-altering effects. But in recent years, researchers have discovered that LSD and similar compounds can also promote neuroplasticity—the brain’s ability to grow new connections and repair damaged circuits. This effect makes psychedelics appealing as potential treatments for mood and cognitive disorders, including depression, substance use, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, their hallucinogenic properties pose risks for certain groups, especially people with schizophrenia or a family history of psychosis. Because of this, researchers have been exploring ways to preserve the therapeutic benefits of psychedelics without inducing hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the hallmarks of schizophrenia is atrophy of neurons in the cortex,” explained lead author David E. Olson, director of the &lt;a href="https://neurotherapeutics.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;UC Davis Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics&lt;/a&gt;. “Psychedelics like LSD are extremely good at promoting cortical neuron growth, but they are typically contraindicated for patients with schizophrenia or a family history of psychosis. We decided to engineer an analogue of LSD with lower hallucinogenic potential in the hopes that this neuroplasticity-promoting compound might be useful for treating these patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the UC Davis team aimed to modify LSD’s structure in a way that would reduce its hallucinogenic potential while maintaining its effects on brain plasticity. They focused on the idea that small changes in a drug’s shape can have big effects on how it interacts with brain receptors. Specifically, they made a tiny adjustment—flipping the position of just two atoms in LSD’s molecular structure. This new version, JRT, turned out to bind to many of the same serotonin receptors as LSD but with a different pharmacological profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You cannot synthesize JRT from LSD or any of the precursors used to make LSD,” Olson said. “We needed to synthesize JRT from scratch. Also, JRT was named after Jeremy R. Tuck, the graduate student who first synthesized it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test JRT’s effects, the researchers conducted a series of experiments, beginning with extensive chemical synthesis and molecular modeling. They confirmed through computer simulations and lab tests that JRT could still interact with serotonin receptors in a way that supports neuroplasticity, but without triggering the signaling pathways that typically lead to hallucinations. Notably, JRT lacked a specific chemical bond (called the indole N–H bond) that LSD uses to form a key interaction in the serotonin 2A receptor—an interaction believed to play a role in producing hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then conducted &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments using rat cortical neurons to examine how JRT affected neuronal growth. Compared to control treatments and existing drugs like clozapine, JRT promoted substantial growth in dendritic branches and spine density—hallmarks of healthy brain connectivity. These effects were even greater than those produced by LSD in the same tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team followed up with &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; studies using mice. A single dose of JRT led to a 46% increase in dendritic spine density and an 18% increase in synapse density in the medial prefrontal cortex, a brain region involved in decision-making and emotional regulation. In another experiment, the researchers showed that JRT could reverse the loss of dendritic spines induced by chronic stress, suggesting its potential to restore brain structure in conditions marked by cortical atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess whether JRT produced psychedelic-like behaviors, the scientists used a behavioral test called the head-twitch response in mice, which correlates with hallucinogenic activity in humans. Unlike LSD, JRT did not trigger the head-twitch response. In fact, it blocked the head-twitch response when mice were given LSD. JRT also did not impair prepulse inhibition—a measure of sensory gating that is often disrupted in schizophrenia and can be worsened by psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also analyzed how JRT affected gene expression in the brain. After a single dose, they found that JRT did not induce gene expression changes associated with schizophrenia, while LSD did. This suggests that JRT is less likely to exacerbate symptoms or increase risk in individuals predisposed to psychotic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JRT’s effects on behavior were also promising. In rodent tests commonly used to model depression, including the forced swim test and sucrose preference test, JRT produced antidepressant-like outcomes. The animals were more active and showed restored interest in pleasurable activities after being treated with JRT. These effects were sustained even when the animals continued to experience stress, indicating that JRT’s impact on mood and motivation might be long-lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, JRT improved performance on a cognitive flexibility task in mice subjected to unpredictable stress. The compound helped the animals learn and adapt when the rules of the task changed, an ability that is often impaired in individuals with schizophrenia and mood disorders. This suggests that JRT may help address cognitive symptoms, which are among the most disabling and treatment-resistant aspects of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers found that JRT was highly selective for serotonin receptors and lacked affinity for other receptor types—such as dopamine, histamine, or adrenergic receptors—that are often linked to side effects in psychiatric medications. This specificity might make JRT safer and better tolerated than drugs like clozapine, which, while effective, often cause weight gain, sedation, and metabolic issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was surprised that transposing only two atoms was sufficient to drastically change the pharmacology of LSD,” Olson told PsyPost. “Not only did it lower hallucinogenic potential, it also improved selectivity across a wide range of targets in the brain. While psychedelics might have therapeutic properties, they were never engineered to be drugs for central nervous system disorders. Even small chemical alterations to the structures of psychedelics have the potential to profoundly improve their safety and efficacy profiles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results are promising, the study does have limitations. All experiments were conducted in animals, and it remains to be seen how well the findings will translate to humans. Although JRT appears to be non-hallucinogenic in rodents, human subjective experiences can differ and will need to be tested in clinical trials. The long-term safety of JRT, especially in vulnerable populations, also needs to be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the moment, JRT has not yet been tested in humans, but we are working towards this goal,” Olson noted. “I would also like to test JRT in other disease models. In particular, I’m very excited about its potential to rescue neuronal atrophy in neurodegenerative conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2416106122" target="_blank"&gt;Molecular design of a therapeutic LSD analogue with reduced hallucinogenic potential&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jeremy R.

&lt;p&gt;Sudden narrowing of the coronary arteries, known as coronary artery spasms, can cause chest pain (angina), heart attacks, and other serious cardiovascular issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A research team led by Dr. Kento Yoshioka, Dr. Keisuke Obara, and Professor Yoshio Tanaka from the Department of Chemical Pharmacology at Toho University’s Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences has discovered that ferulic acid, a natural compound found in rice, coffee, and certain vegetables, can help prevent these spasms through two separate mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Discovery using pig artery models&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used porcine (pig) coronary arteries, which closely resemble human heart arteries, and found that ferulic acid significantly reduced artery contractions caused by chemical stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_479847" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-479847" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-479847" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Diagram-Showing-How-Ferulic-Acid-Prevents-Coronary-Artery-Spasms-777x581.jpg" alt="Diagram Showing How Ferulic Acid Prevents Coronary Artery Spasms" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Diagram-Showing-How-Ferulic-Acid-Prevents-Coronary-Artery-Spasms-777x581.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Diagram-Showing-How-Ferulic-Acid-Prevents-Coronary-Artery-Spasms-400x299.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Diagram-Showing-How-Ferulic-Acid-Prevents-Coronary-Artery-Spasms-768x575.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Diagram-Showing-How-Ferulic-Acid-Prevents-Coronary-Artery-Spasms-150x112.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Diagram-Showing-How-Ferulic-Acid-Prevents-Coronary-Artery-Spasms-450x337.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Diagram-Showing-How-Ferulic-Acid-Prevents-Coronary-Artery-Spasms-1200x898.jpg 1200w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Diagram-Showing-How-Ferulic-Acid-Prevents-Coronary-Artery-Spasms.jpg 1454w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-479847" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ferulic acid blocks calcium from entering muscle cells through L-type calcium channels, which normally cause the arteries to contract.

Credit: Kento Yoshioka&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study revealed two key actions of ferulic acid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It blocks calcium from entering muscle cells through L-type calcium channels, which are normally responsible for causing the arteries to contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even when calcium is not involved, it still prevents the arteries from tightening by inhibiting the activation of a specific protein called myosin light chain, which is essential for muscle contraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Comparison to existing treatments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, ferulic acid was sometimes even more effective than diltiazem, a widely used medication for relaxing blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because ferulic acid is plant-based and considered safe, it may have potential as a health food ingredient or even as a foundation for future heart medications,” said lead researcher Dr. Kento Yoshioka.&lt;br&gt;
This research opens the door to new, natural ways of supporting heart health—possibly through diet or supplements in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Canada have found that anxiety could be a key warning sign that a cat is at risk of developing a disease known as &lt;a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/feline-idiopathic-cystitis-fic-cats"&gt;feline idiopathic cystitis&lt;/a&gt; (FIC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being idiopathic, the cause of FIC is currently a mystery. Yet the discovery of heightened skittishness in kitties with recurrent forms of the condition might be the evidence scientists need to understand the pathology and its triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of FIC tend to mimic those of a typical lower urinary tract infection. Affected cats may strain to urinate, pee in small amounts more frequently, or vocalize their discomfort while using the litter box. In more severe cases, their urine may even contain blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike bacterial infections, however, urine samples from cats with FIC are sterile. Vets will usually rule out infection and other causes before landing on FIC as a likely culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half of all cats unfortunate enough to receive a diagnosis will experience the disease again at some point in their life. And given one in five cats with recurring FIC are eventually put to rest by their owners, a means of distinguishing the illness from other conditions might go a long way to saving &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cats-can-have-a-profound-effect-on-your-physical-and-mental-health"&gt;our beloved cats&lt;/a&gt; from ongoing pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164697" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164697" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CatScaredInRedLitterBox.jpg" alt="cat looking scared in a litter box" class="size-full wp-image-164697" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CatScaredInRedLitterBox.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CatScaredInRedLitterBox-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CatScaredInRedLitterBox-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164697" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Heightened skittishness in kitties with recurrent forms of FIC might be the evidence scientists need to understand the pathology and its triggers. (Kitzzeh/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some cats end up being euthanized because of it," &lt;a href="https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2025/06/10/anxious-cats-prone-to-recurring-cystitis/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; zoological medical scientist Marion Desmarchelier from the University of Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The disease itself is not fatal, but the cost of repeated emergency treatments can be too much for some families."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2022.900847/full"&gt;studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; the condition's roots may be found in the nexus between the body's hormonal and nervous systems. Specifically, in an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022534705652536"&gt;imbalance between&lt;/a&gt; stimulations and responses related to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline"&gt;neurotransmitter adrenaline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The going theory suggests an exaggerated dumping of adrenaline damages junctions in the bladder's wall, exposing sensory nerves that cause pain and trigger inflammation. If the poor moggy lacks an ability to tune down their adrenal response because of the damage, they just might expect episodes of discomfort to repeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the full picture is still unclear, the role of adrenaline points to a psychological component – perhaps not just as a red flag for FIC, but a cause of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164617" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164617" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/scared_cat_642.jpg" alt="scared cat behind a door" class="wp-image-164617 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/scared_cat_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/scared_cat_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164617" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Scaredy cats might be a sign of bladder damage. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEQIkC4nC4/"&gt;Serhii Semenovych/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team contacted owners of cats diagnosed with FIC during the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="164614" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and asked them to fill out a questionnaire on their cat's behavior, potential recurrences of the disease, and whether they complied with certain environmental recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 33 surveys that were returned, the scientists noticed a clear difference between cats who had experienced just one instance of FIC and those with recurrences – just over half of the one-offs were reported to be skittish around strangers, compared with nearly all of those with repeat episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A range of other behaviors could be ruled out as related, including aggression on behalf of the cats or whether they themselves were victims of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We initially thought that anxious, aggressive cats would be more prone to recurrent cystitis, but it's actually the fearful, withdrawn ones that seem to be at greater risk," &lt;a href="https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2025/06/10/anxious-cats-prone-to-recurring-cystitis/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Desmarchelier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest FIC be seen more as a consequence of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-vet-shares-5-simple-tips-to-keep-your-cat-happy-and-healthy"&gt;a cat's mental well-being&lt;/a&gt; rather than a bladder condition. Helping anxious cats feel calm and safe just might reduce their risk of inflammation in their urinary tract, they claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612X18774437"&gt;Calming tactics include&lt;/a&gt; ensuring your cat has access to multiple safe hiding places they can use to escape other household members when they desire. Pheromone therapy can also help lower their stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research could provide crucial evidence that helps pinpoint how a cat's anxiety and comfort in their home affect functions as seemingly unrelated as their ability to urinate comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, pet owners are encouraged to pay close attention to their cat companions when company is around and help them &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-genetic-mystery-of-why-cats-purr-may-finally-be-solved"&gt;feel at ease&lt;/a&gt;. Their anxiety could be having a bigger effect on them than we ever realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2025.02.005"&gt;Journal of Veterinary Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s vital to also perform weight-bearing activities like strength training to preserve muscle and keep your metabolism up while focusing on fat loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19855335/" target="_blank"&gt;(research-backed) rule of thumb&lt;/a&gt; that for the best fat burning potential, you should aim to reach somewhere between 67.6 and 87.1% of your max heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At too high an &lt;a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/article/best-hiit-workouts" target="_blank"&gt;intensity workout&lt;/a&gt; the human body burns more sugar than fat,” Maritato says. “At too low an intensity workout the body burns mostly fat, but not enough to make a measurable difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up: the best fat burning exercises incorporate big muscle groups, will get you mildly sweaty and your heart pumping at a healthy rate. Twenty minutes focused on the below circuit (with an eye on your heart rate) will have the fat melting away, and provide the added bonus of getting your abs sculpted. Don't know where to start? Below are a list of exercises to try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burpees – 60 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start in a plank position with arms extended. Jump your feet forward so you can stand up straight. Jump on the spot, and return to your starting position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plank Crunches – 60 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get into a plank position. Raise your leg so that it forms a 90-degree angle with the corresponding elbow, then return to the start. Repeat for the other leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standing Medicine Ball Twists –  60 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hold a medicine ball at chest height. Hinge at the hips as you drive through your &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/5-core-workouts-in-10-minutes-or-less" target="_blank"&gt;core&lt;/a&gt;, twisting the ball to one side then the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bicycle Crunches – 60 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lie on your back and cycle your legs in the air, forming a 90-degree angle to the ground and bringing your elbow across the body to meet the opposite knee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best diet to lose fat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know that too much junk food is bad for us because it's high in calories, but it may also interfere with your progress in ways you might not realize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fat loss is not just about burning calories through exercise, but about optimizing the body’s metabolism and hormonal profile as well,” Maritato says. “Minimizing processed foods and simple sugars may help reduce gut inflammation and fluid retention. While further research is needed, a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28675945/" target="_blank"&gt;growing body of evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests gut inflammation is linked to fat gain and difficulty burning fat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there's no single solution for each individual person, but a good way to start is by ensuring your &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/best-diet-for-longevity-1#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBasically%2C%20you%20want%20to%20eat,%2C%20legumes%2C%20and%20seeds.%E2%80%9D"&gt;diet is made up of ‘whole foods’&lt;/a&gt;: fresh fruit and veg, lean meats and nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have also shown that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30335476/" target="_blank"&gt;sleep can help regulate metabolism&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, the latest data available, the FDA reported 1,264 cases of BIA-ALCL and 63 deaths in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For their study, published in the journal Blood Advances, researchers &lt;span&gt;followed 3,000 breast cancer survivors at MSKCC who had breast implants after a double mastectomy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Double mastectomies are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14460739/breanna-bortner-dog-sniffed-cancer-saved-life-minnesota.html"&gt;meant to stop breast cancer from spreading&lt;/a&gt; to other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those, 520 were tested for BRCA mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About eight percent of patients, 43, who were tested for BRCA mutations ended up being carriers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After following the women for 12 years on average, the researchers found those with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations had a 16-fold increased risk of BIA-ALCL. They also found women with BIA-ALCL were 'significantly' more likely to have BRCA mutations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Gione said: 'Our findings show that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are a significant risk factor for developing this type of lymphoma, confirming earlier suggestions of a possible role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s possible that implant-associated lymphoma is yet another cancer that can arise because of these genetic mutations.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers said while BIA-ALCL is still rare, women with BRCA mutations should be cautious before receiving textured breast implants (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Breast implants with textured surfaces, which can feel like sandpaper, are thought to create space where bacteria can accumulate and form biofilms, or collections of micro-organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These harmful biofilms can trigger an inflammatory response, which damages DNA and causes cells to mutate into cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Silicone in some implants may also lead to inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because the risk of BIA-ALCL is so low, the FDA doesn't recommend having textured implants removed unless women experience symptoms, which include pain, lumps, swelling or unexpected changes in breast shape.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ghione said: 'The implants that are put in place now are theoretically safe; however, there are still a lot of women who are living with textured breast implants, so it’s important that women know what implants they have and talk with their doctor and remember to report this surgery as part of their medical history.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 14:53:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOZ0tURkxDN01rRVU0a2hPNGV4MnlxcVRfUHY0N1Fsbmd2eEZvZXJxOUwtYWpRMEVKUUx5TlJaT2pjSkwwam83TDc5d2ZPU1R3YlZrMkE4eDdCVFJ4bzdDVTlsNnZkVUloelpwSWJEZExnYnpuOTJJa0Zad0VtNkhGQThHVzlKQUtzVWo5RWtFWmlyMFMtcWpSWFdlN3TSAaIBQVVfeXFMTmI3dlk1VEJ1ZjZSR3ZSY0h3TjdnQldac2VyTUk3YkNpb0pyTmV3dWs3eUxWN3dkRURRZWxydWZkYTd3SGpYUVJSM3NJTjc0cVAwaklsY3lNanMyV2lFdFQ0UFg4OEctLUlmQldKaUx0VW53UjlwcWxuTHhmX2xaaURqdXlPMlhCSjBYYlB5bmwwRkdWWDNSbmhsWHJZQUtVTDd3</guid></item><item><title>水果和蔬菜提高睡眠质量-神经科学新闻 | Fruits and Veggies Boost Sleep Quality - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE1SQVlMSEVsU0VCeUEzNkF1cGxIaG1qMmw0M05Qb1JIYm16MlJKaF9ucFpTUkJ2SnJyNl84Y0ppQ2F0QUhTMERSdWV3dXBHMEU2WHRVSzhjV3hBLTAwZVFKZndWT2NobEs1TTNnNnRlSC1ZV0Z1VVFrRg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study finds that eating more fruits and vegetables during the day is linked to improved sleep quality that same night. Researchers discovered that participants who consumed more produce experienced fewer sleep disruptions, including less waking and shallower sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective wrist monitor data showed a clear association between healthy dietary patterns and better nightly rest. These findings suggest that simple dietary changes could be a powerful and natural tool for enhancing sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immediate Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Eating more fruits and vegetables in a day improves sleep quality that same night.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep fragmentation was reduced in participants who followed CDC dietary recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powerful Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Consuming the recommended five cups of fruits and vegetables was associated with a 16% improvement in sleep quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From counting sheep to white noise and weighted blankets, people have tried innumerable ways to get a good night’s sleep. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disruptions can have far-reaching negative consequences, impacting cardiovascular and metabolic health, memory, learning, productivity, mood regulation, interpersonal relationships and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110892"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc.jpg" alt="This shows a person sleeping and a bowl of fruit." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Participants who ate more fruits and vegetables during the day tended to have deeper, more uninterrupted sleep that same night, as did those who consumed more healthy carbohydrates like whole grains. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that an important tool for improving sleep quality may have been hiding in plain sight…in the produce aisle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study led by researchers at the University of Chicago Medicine and Columbia University found that eating more fruits and vegetables during the day was associated with sleeping more soundly later that same night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dietary modifications could be a new, natural and cost-effective approach to achieve better sleep,” said co-senior author Esra Tasali, MD, director of the UChicago Sleep Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The temporal associations and objectively-measured outcomes in this study represent crucial steps toward filling a gap in important public health knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncovering the connection between diet and sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that inadequate sleep can cause people to gravitate towards unhealthier diets higher in fat and sugar. However, despite the far-reaching effects of sleep on public health and even economic productivity, doctors and scientists know far less about how diet can affect sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In previous observational studies, high fruit and vegetable intakes were associated with better self-reported overall sleep quality, but this new study was the first to draw a temporal connection between a given day’s dietary choices and objectively-measured sleep quality that same night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy young adults who participated in the study reported their food consumption each day with an app and wore a wrist monitor that allowed the researchers to objectively measure their sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers specifically looked at “sleep fragmentation,” an index that reflects how often someone awakens or shifts from deep to light sleep throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising findings support dietary guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that each day’s diet was correlated with meaningful differences in the subsequent night’s sleep. Participants who ate more fruits and vegetables during the day tended to have deeper, more uninterrupted sleep that same night, as did those who consumed more healthy carbohydrates like whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their findings and statistical modeling, the researchers estimate that people who eat the CDC-recommended five cups of fruits and veggies per day could experience a 16 percent improvement in sleep quality compared to people who consume no fruits or vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“16 percent is a highly significant difference,” Tasali said. “It’s remarkable that such a meaningful change could be observed within less than 24 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will help establish causation, broaden the findings across diverse populations, and examine the underlying mechanisms of digestion, neurology, and metabolism that could explain the positive impact of fruits and vegetables on sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But based on current data, the experts confidently advise that regularly eating a diet rich in complex carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables is best for long-term sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are always asking me if there are things they can eat that will help them sleep better,” said co-senior author Marie-Pierre St-Onge, PhD, director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep &amp;amp; Circadian Research at Columbia. “Small changes can impact sleep. That is empowering — better rest is within your control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Higher daytime intake of fruits and vegetables predicts less disrupted nighttime sleep in younger adults” was published in &lt;em&gt;Sleep Health: The Journal of the National Sleep Foundation&lt;/em&gt; in June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-authors include Hedda L.

Greater daytime intakes of fruits and vegetables (β-coefficient (SE)=−0.60 (0.29), &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.038) and carbohydrates (−0.02 (0.007), &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.022), but not added sugar (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.54), were associated with lower sleep fragmentation index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trends toward associations of higher intakes of red and processed meat (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.10) with more disrupted sleep, as well as higher fiber (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.08) and magnesium (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.09) intakes with less disrupted sleep, were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher daytime intakes of fruits and vegetables and carbohydrates that align with a healthy diet were associated with less disrupted nighttime sleep. A 5-cup increase (from no intake) in fruits and vegetables, meeting dietary recommendations, was associated with 16% better sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that diets rich in complex carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables may promote better sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 14:43:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1SQVlMSEVsU0VCeUEzNkF1cGxIaG1qMmw0M05Qb1JIYm16MlJKaF9ucFpTUkJ2SnJyNl84Y0ppQ2F0QUhTMERSdWV3dXBHMEU2WHRVSzhjV3hBLTAwZVFKZndWT2NobEs1TTNnNnRlSC1ZV0Z1VVFrRg</guid></item><item><title>一位医生分享了他每天服用的7种补充剂，以减少炎症、预防心脏病和支持新陈代谢- AOL.com | A doctor shares the 7 supplements he takes a day to reduce inflammation, prevent heart disease, and support metabolism - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTFB1dGVuUFE5ZXNxZGZvY0tvMXNYV3NVRk5wODZZSWpna3llaWZWWlZzSFYtZXNLNGpvX3gySWFFYldrSWlFSXo2d2d4ejJfbnZsUmdzb0dUYmM2QWh3NnVtNzRvT1NtQWU5MGQ2Y2M1Um5CMGJaUlg4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Dr. Gareth Morris-Stiff worked as a liver surgeon for Cleveland Clinic, where he became passionate about supplements to prevent diseases he operated on.&lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Courtesy of Gareth Morris-Stiff/Getty Images/Songboon Ramsak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements like herbs, vitamins, and minerals can backfire if you don't use them correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mixing too many supplements and medications can cause stress and damage to your liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A liver doctor explains his 7-step supplement routine, with benefits for healthy aging and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements can be a great way to get an edge in your fitness, reduce the risk of disease, and even boost longevity — but picking the right combination is key to avoiding side effects, said a liver doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a common misconception that supplements, especially natural ones like herbs, are safer than medications. They can actually cause &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-doctors-dangers-of-taking-multiple-supplements-less-is-more-2024-11?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:serious health problems;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;serious health problems&lt;/a&gt; if taken incorrectly. Up to 20% of liver toxicity cases in the US are related to supplements, research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's also a mistake to rule out the potential health benefits of supplements, including those from traditions like Chinese medicine or Ayurveda, according to Dr. Gareth Morris-Stiff, a former surgeon at Cleveland Clinic and chief medical officer at &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://theliverclinic.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Liver Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;The Liver Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of them extremely useful, very beneficial to human health," Morris-Stiff told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the risks from supplements come from taking too much, or too many compounds at once, including medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a matter of getting the right compound for you as an individual for your needs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to combine supplements without damaging your liver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important rule for your supplement routine is to choose the right supplements for your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, you can work out the balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you want to reduce inflammation, milk thistle can help. But it doesn't mix well with other herbs or drugs like antivirals or sleep medications. Combined, it can become too much for the liver to process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff said one patient he worked with had a cirrhotic liver and jaundice, with yellow skin and eyes, after taking medications with supplements and home-grown garden herbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Individually they were good, but everything coming together, it ended with toxicity. There's too much competition for the detoxification system in the liver," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check an online research database, such as from the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/herb_All.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Library of Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, for safety information and any known drug interactions before starting a supplement. And always consult your doctor if you're not sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what Morris-Stiff takes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Curcumin or turmeric for inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff said daily curcumin has been part of his routine for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curcumin is a bright yellow compound found in the spice &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/turmeric-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:turmeric;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;turmeric&lt;/a&gt;, and research has found it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. A &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11009219/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2024 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found curcumin may help slow aging and help protect cells from damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His daily dose of turmeric comes from a supplement blend called De-Liver-Ance developed by The Liver Clinic, which also includes peppermint, star anise, red sage, and the nutrient choline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Vitamin D is crucial for the immune system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff said he takes a daily multivitamin which contains 5,000 units of vitamin D, well over the typical 600-800 units typically recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that vitamin D has a history of being used in large doses to help the body fight off &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/vitamin-d3-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:illness and infection;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;illness and infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that's more in line with what we need," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as 40% of Americans are deficient in the nutrient. Talk to your doctor to get your own levels tested and see whether supplementing might help, and how much to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Selenium reduces risk of chronic disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mineral found in nuts, seafood, beans, and organ meats, selenium is a antioxidant that can help reduce the risk of heart disease and somes cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff takes 200 micrograms per day, about four times as much usually recommended by the FDA which he said "woefully inadequate" as the amount of the nutrient in our food has &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1611576114" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:declined over time;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;declined over time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Zinc supports healthy aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same multivitamin Morris-Stiff takes daily also includes 50 milligrams of zinc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/zinc-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Zinc;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Zinc&lt;/a&gt; is another trace mineral with an important role in protecting metabolism and healthy cell development over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Magnesium is key for brain and muscle health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rounding out his daily mineral supplements, Morris-Stiff said he takes &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/magnesium-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:500 milligrams of magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;500 milligrams of magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, twice per day, to improve sleep and to help manage a heart condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I use it for rest and sleep predominantly, it helps calm my heart," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/magnesium-for-sleep?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/a&gt; has surged in popularity in recent years as a tool for more restful sleep, as it helps regular the nerves, muscles, and brain, potentially easing anxiety and restlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Fatty acids fight inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff routinely supplements essential fatty acids like &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/omega-3-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;omega-3s&lt;/a&gt;, which have been linked to healthy aging, lower information, and reduced accumulation of fat in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recently switched to taking a similar &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fatty-acid-butter-dairy-may-be-healthy-new-research-suggests-2022-3?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fatty acid called C15:0;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;fatty acid called C15:0&lt;/a&gt;, which emerging evidence suggests may reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and liver problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a surgeon scientist, I like to look at the evidence," he said. "I'm learning and I'm adapting and changing as I come across better supplements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Probiotics like kombucha boost gut health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doctor-shares-foods-prescribed-to-fight-disease-2024-5?utm_campaign=insider-sf&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Certain foods help prevent illness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Certain foods help prevent illness&lt;/a&gt;, too, particularly fermented foods that offer a dose of probiotics, bacteria that support a healthy gut and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff said he drinks both &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/what-is-kefir?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kefir;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;kefir&lt;/a&gt; (similar to yogurt) and kombucha daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-gut-health-microbiome-trend-2025-3?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gut microbiome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, beneficial bacteria in the digestive system, can influence the health of the whole body, including the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This holistic approach is crucial for taking a proactive approach to long-term health overall, helping save you time (and money), according to Morris-Stiff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You could probably prevent four or five consecutive appointments by dealing with the body as a whole as opposed to fixing individual complaints," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-pick-right-supplements-doctors-7-step-daily-routine-2025-6" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Business Insider;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 14:40:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFB1dGVuUFE5ZXNxZGZvY0tvMXNYV3NVRk5wODZZSWpna3llaWZWWlZzSFYtZXNLNGpvX3gySWFFYldrSWlFSXo2d2d4ejJfbnZsUmdzb0dUYmM2QWh3NnVtNzRvT1NtQWU5MGQ2Y2M1Um5CMGJaUlg4</guid></item></channel></rss>
