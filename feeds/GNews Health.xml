              &lt;p&gt;Normally, I’d start this sort of article by saying something along the lines of, “Everyone knows how horrible it is to feel motion sick.” But that’s not entirely true—plenty of people can text, read, and do all sorts of things in a moving vehicle without feeling the slightest bit nauseous. If that sounds like you, you’ll have to trust me—a chronic sufferer of motion sickness—when I say that it wholeheartedly sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Plus, many drugs used for motion sickness come with an unwanted side effect: drowsiness. While that’s useful for a long-haul red-eye, it definitely kills the mood on a road trip. That’s why researchers have looked into whether music can help people recover from carsickness, and they might be onto something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Motion sickness significantly impairs the travel experience for many individuals, and existing pharmacological interventions often carry side-effects such as drowsiness,” Qizong Yue, a researcher at Southwest University in China, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/09/03/happy-music-could-help-you-recover-from-motion-sickness-frontiers-human-neuroscience"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Music represents a non-invasive, low-cost, and personalized intervention strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Simulated carsickness hell&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2025.163610"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published today in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, Yue and colleagues induced carsickness in study participants with a driving simulator (you couldn’t pay me enough to get into that) and then played different types of music while monitoring them for potential recovery. According to their results, soft and joyful music best supported recovery. Perhaps surprisingly, even sad music was worse than doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team divided the 30 participants, who had reported moderate levels of previous carsickness, into six groups—four who listened to music as they recovered from motion sickness, one who didn’t, and one whose simulations stopped before the participant became carsick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone wore &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/about/pac-20393875"&gt;electroencephalogram&lt;/a&gt; (EEG) caps—tools that measure electrical activity in the brain. The researchers hoped to identify brain signals indicative of carsickness by comparing the neural activity of the first five groups with that of the sixth group—the one for which the simulation stopped before participants could become nauseous (ok, maybe you could pay me to be in group six).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers first measured each participant’s EEG signals as they sat still in the simulator. The participants subsequently underwent a driving task and communicated their level of carsickness. At the end of the task, some participants listened to music for 60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team then asked them how carsick they still were. The participants reported that joyful music reduced carsickness by 57.3%, soft music reduced it by 56.7%, and passionate music by 48.3%. While those who didn’t listen to music reported 43.3% fewer carsickness symptoms after the 60 seconds, participants who listened to sad music reported a reduction of just 40%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that soft music might relax tensions that worsen carsickness, and joyful music may provide a distraction by triggering brain reward systems. Sad music could aggravate negative feelings and, as a result, worsen a person’s general discomfort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Your brain when you’re motion sick&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the EEG data revealed changes in participants’ occipital lobe brain activity when they said they were carsick. Specifically, the device recorded less complex activity when participants reported feeling significantly nauseous. As they recovered, brain activity in this area gradually returned to normal levels.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Based on our conclusions, individuals experiencing motion sickness symptoms during travel can listen to cheerful or gentle music to achieve relief,” Yue explained. “The primary theoretical frameworks for motion sickness genesis apply broadly to sickness induced by various vehicles. Therefore, the findings of this study likely extend to motion sickness experienced during air or sea travel.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, “the primary limitation of this study is its relatively small sample size,” the researcher added. “This constraint results in limited statistical power.” What’s more, one’s brain might react differently to a simulation than real-life conditions. In other words, more research with larger samples is needed to confirm both the carsickness brain activity patterns and to continue investigating the impact of music on motion sickness.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the team will study different types of motion sickness and the influence of music taste. And if any of the researchers are reading this article, I’d like to suggest investigating the anecdotal evidence of how singing helps prevent and/or recover from motion sickness. It would finally prove to my family that I literally &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to belt out the lyrics to all of Taylor Swift’s songs when we hit those windy roads.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For years, health authorities have warned against red meat consumption, with the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="172897" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;'s  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="172897" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; research arm classifying it as "probably carcinogenic to humans". But a controversial &lt;a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/apnm-2023-0594"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; challenges that position, suggesting that animal protein might protect against cancer deaths rather than cause them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://monographs.iarc.who.int/agents-classified-by-the-iarc/"&gt;International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)&lt;/a&gt;, part of the WHO, has long classified red meat, including beef, pork, lamb and mutton, as probably carcinogenic. And processed meats such as bacon and sausages are classified as definite carcinogens. This judgment reflects multiple studies linking red meat to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-025-01646-1"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;, forming the basis of dietary advice to limit intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the new research by Canada's McMaster University suggests the opposite: that people who consume more animal protein may actually have &lt;a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/apnm-2023-0594"&gt;lower cancer mortality rates&lt;/a&gt;. But, before you rush out to buy a pack of sausages, there are some important points you should note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's methods contain important nuances that complicate its &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/eating-meat-could-protect-against-cancer-related-death-study-suggests"&gt;headline-grabbing conclusions&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than examining red meat specifically, the researchers analysed consumption of "animal protein", a broad category that &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/11/1771"&gt;includes red meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy products&lt;/a&gt;. This distinction matters significantly because fish, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/3/640"&gt;oily varieties such as mackerel and sardines&lt;/a&gt;, are associated with being cancer-protective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By grouping all animal proteins together, the study may have captured the protective effects of fish and certain dairy products rather than proving the safety of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy products themselves present a complex picture in cancer research. Some studies suggest they &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322002095?via%3Dihub"&gt;reduce colorectal cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; while potentially &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/association-between-dairy-products-consumption-and-prostate-cancer-risk-a-systematic-review-and-metaanalysis/ADBD3EA24DE6E07CE23E0F110012916C"&gt;increasing prostate cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;. This mixed evidence underscores how the broad "animal protein" category obscures important distinctions between different food types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was funded by the &lt;a href="https://www.ncba.org/"&gt;National Cattlemen's Beef Association&lt;/a&gt;, America's primary beef industry lobbying group, contains several other limitations. Crucially, the researchers didn't distinguish between processed and unprocessed meats – a distinction that &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01635580701684872"&gt;countless studies have shown to be vital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meats such as bacon, sausages and deli meats consistently show higher cancer risks than fresh, unprocessed cuts. Additionally, the research didn't examine specific cancer types, making it impossible to determine whether the protective effects apply broadly or to particular cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also examined plant proteins, including legumes, nuts and soy products such as tofu, and found they had no strong protective effect against dying of cancer. This finding contradicts previous research suggesting that &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13668-025-00688-3#Sec11"&gt;plant proteins are linked to decreased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;, adding another layer of complexity to an already confusing picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings don't diminish the established health benefits of plant-based foods, which provide fibre, antioxidants and other compounds associated with reduced disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_151583" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151583" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642.jpg" alt="salad with numerous items" class="wp-image-151583 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-151583" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The new study doesn't undermine the wealth of evidence that plant-based foods are good for you. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/close-up-photo-of-vegetable-salad--ftWfohtjNw"&gt;Nadine Primeau/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not a green light&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the study's conclusions about animal protein prove accurate, the study shouldn't be interpreted as a green light for unlimited meat consumption. Excessive red meat intake remains linked to other serious health conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.imrpress.com/journal/IJVNR/85/1-2/10.1024/0300-9831/a000224"&gt;heart disease and diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. The key lies in moderation and balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conflicting research highlights the complexity of nutrition science, where isolating the effects of individual foods proves remarkably difficult. People don't eat single nutrients in isolation – they consume complex combinations of foods as part of broader lifestyle patterns. It's more important to focus on overall dietary patterns rather than fixating on individual foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/12/1947"&gt;balanced plate approach&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a variety of protein sources, plenty of vegetables and fruits, and minimally processed foods, remains the most evidence-based path to optimal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this latest study adds a new dimension to the meat debate, it's unlikely to be the final word. As nutrition science continues to evolve, the most prudent approach remains the least dramatic: moderation, variety and balance in all things.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264088/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;COVID context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all trials, there are limitations. As mentioned, the number of infections here is small—the impressive efficacy numbers could potentially vanish in a larger trial with more infections. And, while the trial had a high-quality design, it was undertaken in just one location in Germany and mostly involved healthy white women between the ages of 20 and 46, so the findings are not generalizable. The study was also funded by a pharmaceutical company that makes an azelastine nasal spray (though not the one that is sold over the counter in the US).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, with the previous studies, the trial offers some hope that this accessible nasal spray could be used as a viral prophylactic for respiratory seasons in the future. And the results land at a time when access to COVID-19 vaccines—which have firmly proven to be safe and highly effective—has been severely restricted in the US by health secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands now, it appears that only people ages 65 and over, and those at higher risk of COVID-19 will have access to the shots this year, though some aspects of that access are murky, including how people will prove they're at high risk. For healthy children, teens, and adults under 65, there may be no access or extremely limited access. That includes groups that medical experts recommend get vaccinated, namely healthy pregnant people and children ages 6 months to 23 months, both of which are considered at high risk from COVID-19 by medical experts, but not federal guidance under Kennedy. Experts also recommend access for healthy people who have contact with vulnerable people, such as cancer doctors, people who live with immunocompromised family members, and people who work in nursing homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With limited vaccine access and the normal slew of respiratory viruses on the horizon, a simple nasal spray is an appealing addition to the defenses. The main side effects are fairly minor, including bitter taste in the mouth, nosebleeds, and tiredness.&lt;/p&gt;

Because case reporting for COVID is no longer mandated, monitoring largely relies on wastewater testing and lab reports from hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;While the rate of COVID is not near the critical levels seen at the height of the pandemic, Huang said residents should take precautions to prevent spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“Definitely we’re concerned about it, especially for those populations that are most vulnerable, the older populations and those with underlying health conditions,” Huang said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Symptoms of Stratus include congestion, cough, fever, runny nose, fatigue and muscle aches, similar to previous variants. In a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released in June, the World Health Organization says it is monitoring the strain but that it does not appear to pose an additional public health threat compared to other variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Stratus recently surpassed the variant Nimbus, better known by its catchier moniker &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/06/18/new-covid-variant-nimbus-can-cause-razor-blade-throat-what-to-know/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/06/18/new-covid-variant-nimbus-can-cause-razor-blade-throat-what-to-know/"&gt;“razor blade throat,”&lt;/a&gt; named for the excruciating pain it causes. Patients have likened the sensation to swallowing razor blades or shards of glass. The variant is still spreading, accounting for 14% of cases, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;Confusion over vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The spike in cases comes as widespread confusion about who will be eligible to get a vaccine this fall is growing. In May, U.S. Health Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/05/27/covid-vaccines-no-longer-recommended-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women/" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/05/27/covid-vaccines-no-longer-recommended-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women/"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced&lt;/a&gt; that COVID vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women — a move questioned by some public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/05/20/new-federal-rules-for-covid-boosters-could-delay-shots-for-healthy-adults-kids/" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/05/20/new-federal-rules-for-covid-boosters-could-delay-shots-for-healthy-adults-kids/"&gt;Food and Drug Administration provided new requirements&lt;/a&gt; for the shots, saying the vaccine would be available to adults 65 and older and children and younger adults with at least one health problem that puts them at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/08/27/fda-approves-updated-covid-19-shots-but-limits-access-for-some-kids-and-adults/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/08/27/fda-approves-updated-covid-19-shots-but-limits-access-for-some-kids-and-adults/"&gt;U.S. regulators announced that new shots&lt;/a&gt; from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax are approved for all seniors. But the Food and Drug Administration narrowed its use for younger adults and children to those with at least one high-risk health condition, such as asthma or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/08/20/covid-shots-for-kids-still-recommended-by-us-pediatric-group-in-break-with-cdc/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/08/20/covid-shots-for-kids-still-recommended-by-us-pediatric-group-in-break-with-cdc/"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics is still calling for COVID shots &lt;/a&gt;for healthy children beginning at 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Until recently, the U.S. — following guidance from independent experts who advise the CDC — has recommended annual COVID-19 vaccinations for everyone age 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;But Kennedy fired every member of that Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices earlier this year. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-vaccine-advisers-covid19-rsv-a85baa8a9296fd857af5ce33ae3b6cfd" rel=""&gt;The replacements&lt;/a&gt; he selected have yet to make new recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Approved COVID vaccines are expected to remain effective against both the Stratus and Nimbus variants, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Dallas County has ordered the updated COVID vaccine but is waiting on delivery from the state, Huang told county commissioners. The county has set up &lt;a href="https://www.dallascounty.org/departments/dchhs/clinical-services/immunization-clinics.php" rel=""&gt;Community Vaccine Clinics&lt;/a&gt; where residents can get COVID, flu and RSV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Dallas News</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:53:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxOUU1TbHBXXzdxRURxY3lRLS0tRHFlcHBTa2JHR1h6OUxIbjNScDROaHRLVFJKcVVIX1k5MjhRRWwxOHEyemFkcVRDaXZidVdEbUMyZlpEWWozRHB4bVJNakxYWVJOcmxZVGc1WVl1M09zX2pYV2VoNklnWDRsVFdSTkJxMkR0cTllNkZpMnc3YXhjbEJpZG45TjlTNTBLMENmUGdhQV9SU21nYXpVMWlPM2Z1TnF4SnFBVHNERkhR</guid></item><item><title>医生发现了新的潜在治疗方法，可以治疗让患者双手疼痛感冒的病症-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15058391/Doctors-discover-new-potential-treatment-condition-leaves-sufferers-hands-painfully-cold.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have identified a possible cure for a condition that causes chronic cold hands and blights hundreds of millions of people worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raynaud's - estimated to impact up to five percent of adults worldwide, including up to 30 million Americans - causes miniature spasms in the blood vessels in the fingers, toes, ears or nose, which in turn cuts off the blood supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is the body's response to cold temperatures in which smaller arteries that supply blood to the skin constrict dramatically and limit blood supply to certain areas of the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sufferers often go numb in these areas as the blood is limited and skin turns white. During severe attacks, Raynaud's can cause extremely painful symptoms, and even painful sores or tissue death (gangrene) in the affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no known cure for Raynaud's, doctors at Yubei District People's Hospital in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-e071b5b0-8813-11f0-9002-d369dead878b"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; have reported how a minimally invasive surgery could hold the key to keeping symptoms at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/948422"&gt;They detail a case&lt;/a&gt; involving a 67-year-old female patient with a 10-year history of Raynaud's who was admitted to the hospital as her condition worsened and led to gangrene in her right index and middle fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To help alleviate the symptoms, the doctors performed a periosteal distraction osteogenesis (PDO), a minimally invasive operation to stimulate the growth of new bone in areas that have sustained bone loss, which can occur in very severe cases of Raynaud's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The procedure involves separating the membrane covering a bone to create a gap. This then allows new bone to form in the gap to repair any bone defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Raynaud's - estimated to impact up to 5 percent of adults worldwide - causes miniature spasms in the blood vessels, cutting off the blood supply to the fingers and toes (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is often used to treat diabetic foot ulcers and bone loss by promoting the formation of new blood vessels and bone regeneration, leading to improved healing rates and a reduced need for amputations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this case, the medical team at Yubei District People's Hospital decided to apply the treatment to the female patient's hand to treat her gangrene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gangrene occurs when the blood supply to a certain area of the body is interrupted, usually through an injury or infection, and flesh begins to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anonymous case study was also suffering from 'hand ischemia', a condition where blood flow to the hands is reduced or blocked, leading to tissue damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After undergoing a PDO, the doctors reported that the patient's gangrene 'gradually progressively healed', and the pain in both hands caused by the Raynaud's 'markedly diminished.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is believed a PDO could work for Raynaud's as it promotes blood vessels to heal and this could prevent spasms from occurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It could also help heal bone loss when the condition progresses. Bone loss associated with Raynaud's is known as acro-osteolysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They concluded: 'This report supports recent studies that have shown the potential for periosteal distraction osteogenesis in the management of cases of severe and irreversible Raynaud disease of the digits.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More research is being done around Raynaud's and scientists recently discovered a link between the condition and two gene mutations  - one linked to stress and the other to embryo development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a paper published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers in the UK and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/germany/index.html" id="mol-3ac79a90-691a-11ee-86b3-2b7100f3870f"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; carried out the largest genetic study of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They used electronic medical records from the UK Biobank, a database containing genetic and health information from 439,294 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team identified 5,147 people diagnosed with Raynaud's and discovered a variation in two genes that predisposed people to the syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One variation was the alpha-2A-adrenergic receptor for adrenaline, or ADRA2A. This is a stress receptor that causes the small blood vessels to contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;It is the body's response to cold temperatures in which smaller arteries that supply blood to the skin constrict dramatically and limit blood supply to certain areas of the body - most commonly the fingers, but sometimes also the toes, ears, and tip of the nose &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Raynaud's affects women more than men, appears most frequently between the ages of 15 to 30 years old and having a parent, sibling or child with the syndrome appears to increase the risk of primary Raynaud's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second variation was the IRX1, a type of protein shown to be involved in early embryo development and cellular differentiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers discovered a potential benefit of using the antidepressant medication mirtazapine to treat Raynaud's, as it inhibits the function of ADRA2A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it has not yet been proven safe or effective for this use through clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers were able to replicate some of their findings using data from people of British Bangladeshi and Pakistani origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found people with a genetic predisposition to low blood sugar levels have an increased risk of the syndrome, suggesting people should avoid long periods of low blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers' findings help to understand, for the first time, why the small vessels react so strongly in patients, even without external stimuli like exposure to cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are two main types of Raynaud's: primary and secondary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Primary is the most common and is not a result of a medical condition a person may have and can be so mild a person may not need treatment. It also may go away on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As Raynaud's symptoms first appear, fingers will turn white as blood flow is restricted.

As blood flow returns, fingers turn red and people may experience tingling, swelling and/or painful throbbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As there is no cure or current treatment for the syndrome, the goal is to manage the symptoms by reducing their frequency and severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-e8d93a50-8810-11f0-9002-d369dead878b"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox health art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-f37642f0-0dac-11e8-8d90-317dbab06c13" data-permabox-url="/news/fb-5372739/What-Raynauds-disease.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raynaud's condition, triggered by drops in temperature or an increase in stress, causes the blood vessels in the fingers and toes contract, cutting off blood supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also affect the tiny arteries in the nose, ears and tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, Raynaud's causes the fingers or toes to turn white and numb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, as the blood flow returns, they turn blue and eventually red, accompanied by a burning sensation. Attacks can last from a few minutes to an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine out of ten cases are in women, with most sufferers having their first attack before the age of 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although attacks peak in the cold winter months, symptoms can be triggered by everyday tasks such as taking food out of the freezer, air conditioning, or even stress — all of which cause blood vessels to contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most patients can cope by wrapping up warm, although some develop painful weeping ulcers, which can become infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although Raynaud's is common, only a small number of patients go on to develop a more serious connective tissue disease called scleroderma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can cause disability and can be life-threatening, which is why it is important to be diagnosed early on so any complications of the condition can be properly treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raynaud's has a straightforward treatment and can be temporarily cured with a drug called nifedipine which relaxes the muscles of your heart and blood vessels and lowers blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:51:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>慢性压力将免疫细胞送到大脑，导致抑郁症-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/depression-neutrophils-stress-29654/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study shows that chronic stress causes immune cells called neutrophils to leave bone marrow in the skull and collect in the brain’s protective membranes, where they contribute to depressive symptoms. In mice, blocking an immune “alarm” pathway reduced these cells and improved mood-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight how stress reshapes the brain’s immune environment and suggest why one-third of patients may not benefit from current antidepressants. This immune link could provide biomarkers for tailored treatments and help explain depression’s overlap with neurological conditions like stroke and Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic stress triggers neutrophils from skull bone marrow to enter the brain’s meninges, influencing mood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pathway Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocking type I interferon signaling reduced brain neutrophils and depressive behaviors in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could guide new immune-targeted therapies for depression resistant to standard drugs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune cells released from bone marrow in the skull in response to chronic stress and adversity could play a key role in symptoms of depression and anxiety, say researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery – found in a study in mice – sheds light on the role that inflammation can play in mood disorders and could help in the search for new treatments, in particular for those individuals for whom current treatments are ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 1 billion people will be diagnosed with a mood disorder such as depression or anxiety at some point in their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there may be many underlying causes, chronic inflammation – when the body’s immune system stays active for a long time, even when there is no infection or injury to fight – has been linked to depression. This suggests that the immune system may play an important role in the development of mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have highlighted how high levels of an immune cell known as a neutrophil, a type of white blood cell, are linked to the severity of depression. But how neutrophils contribute to symptoms of depression is currently unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In research published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, a team led by scientists at the University of Cambridge, UK, and the National Institute of Mental Health, USA, tested a hypothesis that chronic stress can lead to the release of neutrophils from bone marrow in the skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cells then collect in the meninges – membranes that cover and protect your brain and spinal cord – and contribute to symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it is not possible to test this hypothesis in humans, the team used mice exposed to chronic social stress. In this experiment, an ‘intruder’ mouse is introduced into the home cage of an aggressive resident mouse. The two have brief daily physical interactions and can otherwise see, smell, and hear each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that prolonged exposure to this stressful environment led to a noticeable increase in levels of neutrophils in the meninges, and that this was linked to signs of depressive behaviour in the mice. Even after the stress ended, the neutrophils lasted longer in the meninges than they did in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis confirmed the researchers’ hypothesis that the meningeal neutrophils – which appeared subtly different from those found in the blood – originated in the skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis suggested that long-term stress triggered a type of immune system ‘alarm warning’ known as type I interferon signalling in the neutrophils. Blocking this pathway – in effect, switching off the alarm – reduced the number of neutrophils in the meninges and improved behaviour in the depressed mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pathway has previously been linked to depression – type 1 interferons are used to treat patients with hepatitis C, for example, but a known side effect of the medication is that it can cause severe depression during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Stacey Kigar from the Department of Medicine at the University of Cambridge said: “Our work helps explain how chronic stress can lead to lasting changes in the brain’s immune environment, potentially contributing to depression. It also opens the door to possible new treatments that target the immune system rather than just brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a significant proportion of people for whom antidepressants don’t work, possibly as many as one in three patients. If we can figure out what’s happening with the immune system, we may be able to alleviate or reduce depressive symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason why there are high levels of neutrophils in the meninges is unclear. One explanation could be that they are recruited by microglia, a type of immune cell unique to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible explanation is that chronic stress may cause microhaemorrhages, tiny leaks in brain blood vessels, and that neutrophils – the body’s ‘first responders’ – arrive to fix the damage and prevent any further damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These neutrophils then become more rigid, possibly getting stuck in brain capillaries and causing further inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Mary-Ellen Lynall from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge said: “We’ve long known that something is different about how neutrophils behave after stressful events, or during depression, but we didn’t know what these neutrophils were doing, where they were going, or how they might be affecting the brain and mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that these ‘first responder’ immune cells leave the skull bone marrow and travel to the brain, where they can influence mood and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people will have experienced how our immune systems can drive short-lived depression-like symptoms. When we are sick, for example with a cold or flu, we often lack energy and appetite, sleep more and withdraw from social contact. If the immune system is always in a heightened, pro-inflammatory state, it shouldn’t be too surprising if we experience longer-term problems with our mood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could provide a useful signature, or ‘biomarker’, to help identify those patients whose mood disorders are related to inflammation. This could help in the search for better treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a clinical trial of a potential new drug that targets inflammation of the brain in depression might appear to fail if trialled on a general cohort of people with depression, whereas using the biomarker to identify individuals whose depression is linked to inflammation could increase the likelihood of the trial succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings may also help explain why depression is a symptom common in other neurological disorders such as stroke and Alzheimer’s disease, as it may be the case that neutrophils are being released in response to the damage to the brain seen in these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it may also explain why depression is itself a risk factor for dementia in later life, if neutrophils can themselves trigger damage to brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, Medical Research Council and National Institute for Health and Care Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d7b4a5b6beb0f9b5a5beb2a5bbb2ae97b6b3babeb9f9b4b6baf9b6b4f9a2bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Craig Brierley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cam.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Craig Brierley – University of Cambridge&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-62840-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chronic social defeat stress induces meningeal neutrophilia via type I interferon signaling in male mice&lt;/a&gt;” by Stacey Kigar et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic social defeat stress induces meningeal neutrophilia via type I interferon signaling in male mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for psychiatric disorders. Animal models of stress and stress-related disorders are associated with blood neutrophilia. The mechanistic relevance of this to symptoms or behavior is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We characterized the immune response to chronic social defeat (CSD) stress at brain border regions in male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that chronic, but not acute, stress causes neutrophil accumulation in the meninges—i.e., “meningeal neutrophilia”— but not the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CSD promotes neutrophil trafficking to meninges via vascular channels originating from skull bone marrow (BM). Transcriptional analysis suggests CSD increases type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in meningeal neutrophils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking this pathway via the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) protects against the negative behavioral effects of CSD stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our identification of IFN-I signaling as a putative mediator of meningeal neutrophil recruitment may facilitlate development of new therapies for stress-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:15:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1DWnFUckhEbkFLWGNIOEYzZF9hUmdDNFJfdjVhd1ZYNTVlcXJCaDNUaTVqMWdKalUzbEVtYkZPelhSWnVHVkdyV3EyN0dZdkRNcks1aEVMcXAxRGNrLThHQXdodVVIckNlQnNfNV8wbnRBOWs</guid></item><item><title>“fibermaxxing”的危险......专家揭示了饮食趋势如何增加患癌症的风险-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15058047/dangers-fibermaxxing-experts-warn-risk-cancer.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's no secret that America has a fiber problem.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests about 95 percent of Americans don't get the federally recommended amount of fiber in a day from foods like berries, apples, broccoli and lentils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fiber is crucial for regulating healthy digestion. It helps bulk up stools to make them easier to pass, promoting regular bowel movements. It also slows gastric emptying, which leads to longer feelings of fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the shorter term, not getting at least 21 to 38 grams of daily fiber, depending on age and sex, can lead to constipation, bloating, cramping and gas. But over time, low fiber has been linked to chronic inflammation, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-51e2f670-8808-11f0-9c1a-d73045d9f333"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease and colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-51e28140-8808-11f0-9c1a-d73045d9f333"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, health experts are now sounding the alarm over getting too much fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Social media users are promoting 'fibermaxxing,' or loading up on large amounts of fiber, particularly from the plethora of emerging sodas and snacks high in the nutrient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dietitians and physicians told DailyMail.com that while fiber is essential for maintaining healthy digestion, too much can lead to 'gastrointestinal distress,' including constipation, bloating, gas and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in the long term, getting upwards of 50 grams per day may lead to a rare chance of intestinal blockages. Emerging research also shows certain kinds of fiber like inulin, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14554801/healthy-soda-alternatives-celebrities-cancer-poppi-olipop.html"&gt;found in high-fiber drinks like Poppi&lt;/a&gt;, may increase the risk of liver cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;About 95 percent of Americans don't get enough fiber-rich foods like broccoli and whole grains. But experts have warned of the dangers of eating too much (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Paris Hilton is among Poppi's high profile fans. The soda is high in inulin, a type of fiber that some studies have linked to cancer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Candace Pumper, a registered dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, told DailyMail.com: 'Consuming adequate fiber within established guidelines in our diet is important for optimal health and bodily function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Dietary fiber provides many functional benefits – such as adding bulk to stool, which is important for promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation – and physiological benefits through fermentation by the gut microbiome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These effects have been shown to lower cholesterol, regulate blood sugar, promote satiety and reduce inflammation, Pumper said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regulating these functions, she noted, is associated 'with a decreased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and colorectal cancers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Most Americans are not meeting the recommended daily amount of dietary fiber, making its optimization an important health strategy for reducing their risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To help fill these gaps, snacks and sodas high in fiber have gained popularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poppi and Olipop, for instance, contain between three to nine grams of inulin, a form of dietary fiber found naturally in some plants chicory root, garlic, onions, and Jerusalem artichoke. It is also considered a fructan, a type of prebiotic, meaning it can help feed 'good' bacteria in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gut bacteria convert inulin and other prebiotics into short-chain fatty acids, which can help strengthen the gut's protective lining and reduce inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a growing body of research suggests repeated inulin consumption could lead to long-term health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Andrew Gewirtz, a biomedical science professor at Georgia State University, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.gsu.edu/2018/10/18/adding-refined-fiber-to-processed-food-could-have-negative-health-effects-study-finds/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;conducted a 2018 study&lt;/a&gt; that found mice who had inulin added to their diets developed jaundice, a sign of liver failure. After six months, they showed signs of liver cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S277257232300198X"&gt;2024 case study&lt;/a&gt; authored by the same team suggested inulin 'may be carcinogenic.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Olipop is one of the most popular fiber-rich soda brands, generating $500million in sales last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man in the case study had his first colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer at age 56, which came back normal. But seven years later, another screening showed a malignant tumor at the start of his large intestine. The disease had also spread to his lymph nodes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now in his 60s, the man had no known colon cancer risk factors like obesity, alcohol use, or family history, and his diet was rich in organic, home-grown vegetables. His only lifestyle change in the time between screenings was adding four grams of inulin powder daily to his diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gena Hamshaw, a registered dietitian at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, told DailyMail.com: 'While inulin in sodas may favor a healthy balance of intestinal flora, it doesn’t offer all of the benefits of other types of fiber, such as the inhibition of cholesterol absorption that’s associated with soluble fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s important to remember that there are different types of fiber, each with benefits, and the best means of reaping all of their benefits is to eat a varied diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking several of these sodas could quickly increase overall fiber consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DailyMail.com &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14554801/healthy-soda-alternatives-celebrities-cancer-poppi-olipop.html"&gt;previously reached out&lt;/a&gt; to Poppi and Olipop regarding these claims but did not hear back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Olipop &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/29/poppi-olipop-healthy-soda-warning"&gt;told Axios&lt;/a&gt; in a March statement: 'Like any fiber, inulin may cause temporary digestive discomfort as the body adjusts to increased fiber intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's why both nutrition experts and OLIPOP recommend starting with one can and gradually increasing over time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brea Lofton, a registered dietitian nutritionist at health and wellness company Lumen, told this website that while it 'is undoubted that fiber can be beneficial for a number of reasons,' consuming excessive amounts, 'especially when you increase your fiber intake too quickly, can lead to gastrointestinal distress.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts told DailyMail.com to get a variety of fiber sources instead of relying on one or two from processed foods (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pumper said: 'Sudden increases in fiber or consuming too much fiber, whether above the recommended daily amount or all at once, may cause bloating, gas, and abdominal discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Overdoing it can also cause constipation and impair nutrient absorption.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because the gut microbiome needs time to adjust to increased fiber if someone generally consumes under the recommended amount.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hamshaw told this website that while rare, 'an intestinal blockage could be the result of extremely high fiber intake, especially without good hydration and enough chewing of food.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In large quantities and without enough water to help with absorption, undigested fiber can form a dense mass called a bezoar. This risk is highest in people with digestive conditions like Crohn's disease or previous bowel surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Another long-term concern is that excessive fiber intake may inhibit absorption of important minerals, including iron, zinc, and calcium,' Hamshaw said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said while there is no firm limit, getting upwards of 50 grams of fiber per day is enough to cause complications. Dr Omer Awan, a medical professor at the University of Maryland with a specialization in epidemiology, meanwhile told DailyMail.com the limit might be closer to 70 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hamshaw told this website: 'It's also good to keep in mind that the plant foods with the most dietary fiber, including fruits, vegetables, seeds, grains, and nuts, are typically nutrient-dense foods. These foods offer phytonutrients, minerals, and vitamins as well as dietary fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Fiber-fortified snacks and sodas can definitely be part of a healthful dietary pattern.

They'd rather not think about the next one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But for Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) Director Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, the mistakes that were made during the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the lessons learned, provide an opportunity to explore how a future pandemic caused by an even deadlier virus than SARS-CoV-2 could play out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Big One: How We Must Prepare for Future Deadly Pandemics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Osterholm and his co-author and longtime collaborator Mark Olshaker weave together two threads. One is an assessment of how the COVID-19 pandemic was handled by the US government and public health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Osterholm says it's the culmination of a project that began early on in the pandemic, when he and Olshaker recognized that many mistakes were being made and they authored several op-eds that were critical of the federal response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"At that point, we realized we really needed to write a book about this pandemic when it finally ends, and what lessons should be learned," he says in an upcoming episode of the Osterholm Update podcast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along the way, Osterholm and Olshaker address many of the most prominent controversies that have come to dominate the national discussion about the pandemic, from lockdowns and school closures to communications failures and the debates over masking and vaccine mandates. The aim was not just to highlight the mistakes or place blame, but to understand the lessons that can be drawn from those mistakes and then applied to the next pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Some of the problems we collectively encountered were structural, and not quick or easy to solve," Osterholm and Olshaker write. "But they all have to be addressed if we are to have a chance of triumphing in the microbe wars."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;'A great mystery story'&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The next pandemic is the focus of the other strand of the book, a "thought experiment" developed by Osterholm and Olshaker that traces the path of a hypothetical virus that originates in Somalia, soon jumps to a nearby refugee camp in Kenya, and then spreads like wildfire around the globe. The virus, eventually labeled SARS-CoV-3, combines the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 with the lethality of the original SARS virus (which caused a global outbreak in 2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"What would happen if you had a virus that had the capacity to infect like COVID, but the ability to kill like MERS or SARS?" asks Osterholm, who is also a Regents Professor and the McKnight Presidential Endowed Chair in Public Health at the University of Minnesota. "And believe it or not, we have now found viruses—in bats in caves in China—that have that construct. So this is not just science fiction; we actually know these viruses exist."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The scenario describes the impact of the virus as it spreads and causes havoc around the globe, but it also delves into the response from US and global officials, the public reaction, and the role of the media. For many readers, it might feel like being transported back to early 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What would happen if you had a virus that had the capacity to infect like COVID, but the ability to kill like MERS or SARS?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Olshaker says they wanted to create a "nightmare scenario" that was realistic, scientifically plausible, not over-the-top, and gripping. He compares it to the true crime books he's co-authored.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"What we have here is great mystery story, which is what public health really is, as well as high technological drama," he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/michael-t-osterholm-phd-mph/the-big-one/9780316258340/?lens=little-brown-spark"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Big One: How We Must Prepare for Future Deadly Pandemics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is out today.

              &lt;p&gt;A common treatment given after heart attacks may not be worthwhile for a large segment of the population. New trial data finds that most people who suffer a heart attack do not benefit from taking beta-blockers afterward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A large international team of researchers conducted the trial, which compared the outcomes of nearly 10,000 heart attack patients who were either given beta-blocker therapy or not.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“This trial will reshape all international clinical guidelines.”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;On average, people with preserved heart function given beta-blockers were no less likely to die or to experience a second heart attack than those not given beta-blockers, the researchers found. Secondary data also showed that women might actually face a higher risk of complications from taking these medications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This trial will reshape all international clinical guidelines,” said senior study author Valentin Fuster, president of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital, in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250831010539.htm"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why doctors use beta-blockers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more than 40 years, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/beta-blockers/art-20044522"&gt;beta-blockers&lt;/a&gt; have been a key aspect of treating and managing cardiovascular disease. These drugs block the effects of adrenaline on the body’s beta-receptors, which then reduces heart rate and lowers blood pressure (among other bodily changes). They’re often used to reduce stress on a badly damaged heart following a heart attack (myocardial infarction), in theory lowering the risk of a second heart attack or other cardiovascular issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But heart medicine has evolved greatly since the arrival of the first beta-blockers in the 1960s. New treatments and improved knowledge have made it easier for doctors to prevent these infarctions from causing as much damage to the heart as before. And that’s led some researchers to wonder whether beta-blockers should still be considered a front-line treatment following heart attacks, including the team behind this large new trial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A therapy in need of a reboot&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s trial, named REBOOT, involved roughly 8,500 people. The patients had all experienced relatively mild heart attacks and appeared to have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) above 40%. LVEF measures how well our left ventricle (the main pumping chamber) pumps out blood. A healthy LVEF is typically considered above 51%, while slightly reduced function is between 40% and 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Half of the patients were randomized to receive beta-blockers after being discharged from the hospital, while the other half received none. Both groups were then tracked for several years (median length 3.7 years).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the study’s end, there wasn’t any significant difference in outcomes between the two groups. Deaths (from any cause), secondary heart attacks, and hospitalizations from heart failure occurred just as often in the beta-blocker group as they did in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Since these kinds of heart attacks represent the majority of cases (roughly 80%) today, the team’s findings—&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504735"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend in the New England Journal of Medicine—indicate that beta-blockers shouldn’t be a standard treatment for most heart attack patients, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Harmful for some, useful for others&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While beta-blocker therapy may be worthless for most male heart attack patients, it could be actively dangerous to women in particular.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a secondary analysis of the REBOOT results, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf673/8243876"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the European Heart Journal, women on beta-blockers had higher rates of heart attacks, hospitalization, and death than women not on the drug. On closer inspection, this added risk was only seen in women who maintained normal heart function (LVEF above 50%). Though it’s not entirely clear why only women might experience this risk, studies have found that heart attacks can &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2024/02/09/the-slowly-evolving-truth-about-heart-disease-and-women#:~:text=As%20for%20better,in%20their%20arteries."&gt;present differently&lt;/a&gt; in women compared to men and cause differing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings should better optimize the long-term care of heart attack patients, who are often already prescribed multiple medications to keep their cardiovascular health in check. “These results will help streamline treatment, reduce side effects, and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year,” said lead author Borja Ibáñez, scientific director of Spain’s National Center for Cardiovascular Research (CNIC), in a statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, the REBOOT trial won’t bury beta-blockers for good. The drugs may still help prevent complications in people with severe heart attacks and are &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22318-beta-blockers"&gt;widely used&lt;/a&gt; for other conditions, including congestive heart failure, migraines, and even performance anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf2vr8sw000o3b7abepiwsjm@published"&gt;I’m a straight, cis female. My whole adult life, vaginal sex has always been sort of meh to me. I love the foreplay, my clitoris is very sensitive, and I get easily turned on. But when it comes to the actual intercourse part, it’s always felt like nothing at best and vaguely painful at worst. I’ve seen doctors, but the symptoms of conditions like vaginismus and vulvodynia don’t really match mine. It kind of just feels like I have no nerve endings in there at all. I’ve also gone to bed with enough men to know it’s not just a bad partner. Toys do nothing for me either.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="13" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf2vr8w8000p3b7atmv99318@published"&gt;A few months ago, my boyfriend and I decided to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf2wpz4j005y3b7apvy06pmb@published"&gt;We had anal sex. I’d always been resistant to anal because I have some digestive issues, but wanted to try it, so we did, and WOW. It’s like whatever nerves are missing from my vagina got put in the back door instead. I finally understood what people love about penetrative sex, and it didn’t hurt at all. I’ve never had an orgasm just from penetration before until that night, when I had like three or four in a row without touching my clit at all. It’s not just the orgasm part; it’s just the feeling of anything at all pleasurable from penetration. It got even better the deeper my partner went (whereas in regular PIV, I tend to have less sensation the deeper it is).&lt;/p&gt;

The digestive issues have not improved (and actually have worsened). And I don’t think my boyfriend wants to do anal every single time we have sex (is that even healthy?). Why does anal sex feel so good for me compared to vaginal sex? Everything I’ve seen online says even the cis females who enjoy anal and find that it feels good still prefer vaginal sex.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-blockquote/instances/cmf2y1b6v006n3b7awp4rky2i@published" class="slate-blockquote" data-word-count="319"&gt;
  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, for some people, anal sex can definitely be a pleasurable alternative. The anus and rectum have different nerve endings and innervation patterns compared to the vagina, which can translate into entirely different sensations. The so-called “A-spot” (anterior fornix) and surrounding nerve-rich tissue can create intense stimulation and, for many, powerful orgasms. Pleasure here often comes down to anatomy, muscle relaxation, and pacing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anal canal is surrounded by muscles that need to be relaxed, and its skin is thinner and more delicate, which means lubrication, patience, and gradual progression are absolutely necessary. This is where tools like anal dilators (such as &lt;a href="https://futuremethod.com/products/glass-anal-dilator-set"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://futuremethod.com/products/silicone-anal-dilator-set"&gt;silicone&lt;/a&gt; sets, like the ones I developed for Future Method) can help train both body and mind. Starting small, pre-lubricating, and working up in size conditions the muscles and tissue to stretch comfortably. Many people also find that experimenting with different positions, depth, and thrusting styles during toy play helps them discover what feels good while maintaining control over the experience. I’m a huge advocate of personal exploration because it allows people to see what they like (and don’t like) without the pressure of having to perform for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common worry is the digestive system “getting in the way.” The reality is that with everyday anal play, the rectum is usually clear of stool. Good digestive health makes a huge difference, such as adequate dietary fiber, probiotics, and hydration to support regularity and reduce the likelihood of issues. If someone chooses to prepare ahead of time, I recommend douching safely; over-cleansing with plain water, harsh soaps, or even store-bought enemas can damage tissue and disrupt the microbiome. That’s why I developed an &lt;a href="https://futuremethod.com/products/anal-douche-kit"&gt;isotonic cleansing solution&lt;/a&gt; at Future Method, designed to be body-compatible, non-irritating, and effective without stripping natural defenses. I know people crave confidence when it comes to anal play, so why not have a body-safe solution to help you achieve that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here’s what Dr. Goldstein recommends: “For vaginal pain: a gynecologist trained in sexual pain disorders, for anal health concerns: a proctological surgeon, and for pelvic floor dysfunction or muscle-related pain: a pelvic floor physical therapist,” adding that “each of these specialists brings a different perspective, and ideally, they work together to ensure a holistic plan.”&lt;/p&gt;

His preferences will likely be a balance between how he feels about the act itself and how he feels about your pleasure, and he’s the only person who can say, with certainty, what his stance is.&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re not OK with either of those scenarios, always know that you get to have boundaries, and you get to decide how you’re willing to be treated in hook-ups and relationships. And you get to make those choices from date to date, depending on the context of the person you’re interacting with and how you’re feeling that day.&lt;/p&gt;

The place we’ve rented has a private hot tub, so my husband and I finally got to realize our fantasy of skinny dipping together. While we were in the hot tub, I rediscovered an old favorite of mine. When I was a kid, I used to swim competitively, so I spent a lot of time in the pool. When I was very young, I accidentally discovered that the pool jet against my clit felt amazing. When I got a little older, I connected the dots and realized I’d essentially been masturbating in public, so I stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

I did, and it was so incredibly hot, and my orgasm was crazy intense. Now, we’re wondering if there’s any toy that might simulate the sensation of a pool jet on my clit. We’ve played around with some different vibrators before, but none of them have been quite right. Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re in an area where you’re not worried about water consumption, a fairly focused showerhead will be your most similar option, and you can probably get pretty close to the same sensation from the jet if you use that showerhead underwater in a full bath. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID cases are high in Texas, California, Oregon, Nevada, New Mexico and other states in the West and South Central part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s worth knowing that COVID tracking data is less reliable now &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/covid-cases-up-summer-why_l_68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" title="" target="_blank"&gt;because of COVID funding cuts&lt;/a&gt; by the Trump administration&lt;/strong&gt;, less testing and the discontinuation of certain tools researchers relied on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing cases increase here in Houston, and in Texas, and if we look at the data that is available from [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], it certainly seems like the South Central U.S. — Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana — are seeing some of the higher test positivity rates in the in the country,” said &lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/faculty/scott-long/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. S. Wesley Long&lt;/a&gt;, the medical director of diagnostic microbiology at Houston Methodist Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/scott-c-roberts/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Scott Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease doctor at Yale Medicine in Connecticut, “the highest test positivity is in the Texas region ... with the second highest kind of broadly being the West Coast. So, the Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada areas, but that does extend through Colorado and then the Dakotas.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID cases are rising throughout the country, but rates are lower in the Eastern U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new COVID variants, Stratus and Nimbus, are behind the summer increase in cases, said Roberts, but they are not any more severe than previous COVID strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Simple lifestyle changes can help, and the NHS says people who smoke, are overweight and drink too much alcohol are more likely to snore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also say sleeping on your back can make you more likely to have the annoying habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it can be caused by sleep apnoea which is estimated to affect 15 million Britons according to the British Snoring and Sleep Apnoea Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are two distinct types of sleep apnoea, Central Sleep Apnoea (CSA) and Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA), he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CSA is caused by the brain not sending proper signals to the muscles that control breathing during sleep whereas OSA is caused by the upper airways being obstructed, Mr Surda said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More people are affected by obstructive sleep apnoea than central sleep apnoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly to regular snoring, sleep apnoea occurs when the muscles at the back of the throat relax excessively, causing the airway to become partially or fully blocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously Dr Pavol Surda, a sleep-disordered breathing expert at London Bridge Hospital &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13644345/snoring-problem-increase-risk-heart-disease.html"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;the Daily Mail it is treatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'If you suspect that you or a loved one may have sleep apnoea, seeking help from a specialist is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Specialists can conduct a thorough evaluation, often involving a sleep study to monitor breathing patterns, oxygen levels, and other vital signs during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Treatment options vary depending on the severity of the condition and may include lifestyle changes, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, oral appliances, or in some cases, surgery.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES — It’s one of the most insidious diseases you’ve never heard of, but Chagas is here in California and 29 other states across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It kills more people in Latin America than malaria each year, and researchers think roughly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5154432/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;300,000 people in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; currently have it but are unaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because the illness tends to lie dormant for years, only making itself known when its victim keels over via heart attack, stroke or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease is caused by the parasite &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi,&lt;/em&gt; which lives in a bloodsucking insect called the kissing bug. There are roughly a dozen species of kissing bugs in the U.S. and four in California known to carry the parasite. Research has shown that in some places, such as Los Angeles’ Griffith Park, about a third of all kissing bugs harbor the Chagas parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s why a team of epidemiologists, researchers and medical doctors are calling on the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;to label the disease as endemic&lt;/a&gt;, meaning consistently present, in the U.S. They hope that will bring awareness, education, dialogue and potentially public health investment to a disease that has long carried a stigma, falsely associated with poor, rural migrants from bug-infected homes in far-off tropical nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a disease that has been neglected and has been impacting Latin Americans for many decades,” said Norman Beatty, a medical epidemiologist at the University of Florida and an expert on Chagas. “But it’s also here in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had a kid from the Hollywood Hills who got it,” said Salvadore Hernandez, a cardiologist with Kaiser Permanente in Northern California. He said the patient had not traveled out of the country and probably got it in his leafy, affluent neighborhood, where kissing bugs are prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite has also been detected in local wildlife, including wood rats, skunks and mice in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7906329/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;Griffith Park&lt;/a&gt;, as well as bats, raccoons and black bears in other parts of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kissing bugs are pretty equal opportunity when it comes to who they take a blood meal from,” said Sarah Hamer, an epidemiologist at Texas A&amp;amp;M University’s School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, listing off a variety of animals, such as ocelots, bobcats, coyotes, birds, reptiles and amphibians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That means the reservoir for &lt;em&gt;T. cruzi &lt;/em&gt;is pretty large,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California has the largest number of people in the U.S. infected with Chagas disease —  between 70,000 and 100,000. That’s mostly because the state is home to so many people from countries where the disease is endemic. But it’s also because the parasite and vector live here, meaning some of those cases could be home-grown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0013036" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; by the state’s Department of Public Health, for instance, found that 31 of 40 human cases reported to the state between 2013 and 2023 — about 78% — were acquired in other countries. For the remaining cases, health officials couldn’t rule out local transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chagas is not a reportable disease in California, which means the state does not require physicians and health systems to report and investigate it, as it does with influenza, Lyme and malaria. However, it is reportable in Los Angeles and San Diego counties; Los Angeles was the first county in the state to mandate reporting of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2019 and 2023, health officials confirmed about 18 cases of Chagas disease in L.A. County, “although many more cases likely go undiagnosed,” the department wrote in a statement. It said most of the identified cases were infected internationally, but some appear to be locally acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Hamer, an entomologist at Texas A&amp;amp;M, said that confirmed human cases in the U.S. represent “just the tip of the iceberg” and that nobody really knows how many people actually have the disease. “There’s no standardized reporting system. There’s no active surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people find out they have the disease only after trying to donate blood, said Hamer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janeice Smith, a retired teacher in Florida, discovered she had it in 2022 after receiving a letter from her local donation center telling her she’d tested positive and should go see a physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith now runs &lt;a href="https://kissingbugalliance.org/janeices-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;a nonprofit&lt;/a&gt; to increase awareness of Chagas, which she said she probably got in 1966 when her family went to Mexico for vacation. She had returned home with a swollen eye and high fever, and was hospitalized for several weeks. No one found out what caused her symptoms until almost six decades later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamer said proteins in the kissing bugs’ saliva can cause acute reactions, such as swollen limbs, eyes and anaphylaxis, all unrelated to the disease-carrying parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s the longer-term or chronic effects that cause the most harm. And because the disease is not well known, and its symptoms are often indistinguishable from other forms of cardiac and organ damage, it’s likely many people are showing up to their doctors’ offices with heart arrhythmia, a swollen esophagus, seizures and stroke, without ever being screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The disease is definitely underdiagnosed,” said Hernandez, the Kaiser cardiologist. “If we screened for it and caught it early, most patients could be cured. The problem is we don’t, and people end up dying or requiring terrifically expensive care,” including organ transplants and surgery.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;div class="pull-quote-embed embed-container u-border-light-gray u-border-b u-border-t u-tc mv-40 pt-10 pb-15"&gt;&lt;p class="pull-quote-content"&gt;The disease is definitely underdiagnosed. If we screened for it and caught it early, most patients could be cured. The problem is we don’t, and people end up dying or requiring terrifically expensive care,” including organ transplants and surgery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;— Salvadore Hernandez, a cardiologist in Northern California&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-parasitic medications can be used to stop disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas is also prevalent in dogs who show similar clinical signs, heart failure or arrhythmias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll see these acutely infected, usually young dogs that might be puppies, or dogs less than 1 or 2 years of age that are really adversely affected. And then we would have dogs that would come in older, and they might be in heart failure,” said Ashley Saunders, a Texas A&amp;amp;M veterinary cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said dogs often acquire the disease by eating the bugs, which give a much higher “dose” of the parasite than a few bug poops in a cut.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A bottle that looks clear can quietly change  inside, and what you cannot see still matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmth and light do two things. They help microbes multiply after a single sip, and they also stress the plastic itself, allowing particles and additives to work their way into the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beizhan Yan from Columbia University’s &lt;a href="https://lamont.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has led key research on how plastic particles appear in bottled water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heat-turns-bottles-into-incubators"&gt;Heat turns bottles into incubators&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a bottle is opened, microbes hitch a ride from your mouth, your hands, or the air. A 2005 analysis reported that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/some-bacteria-breathe-by-creating-electricity/"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; in room temperature bottled water can surge within 48 hours after a single sip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat speeds that up. In closed cars, interiors often rise well above the outside air, and at about 77°F (25°C), microbes can multiply quickly, including species associated with foodborne illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many single-use bottles are made of &lt;em&gt;polyethylene terephthalate&lt;/em&gt;. Sunlight and warmth cause this material to break down at the surface, allowing tiny fragments to move into the liquid..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 study that simulated in-vehicle heat and sunlight measured up to 10.03 parts per million of microplastics in bottled water after 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those particles came from the bottle walls during photothermal stress, not from outside contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nanoplastics-revealed-in-bottled-water"&gt;Nanoplastics revealed in bottled water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier surveys already showed how widespread the problem is. An international survey reported that 93 percent of bottled water contained plastic fragments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New tools peered even smaller. In 2024, a peer reviewed paper used laser based imaging to count about 240,000 particles per liter in popular brands, and most were nanoplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens a window where we can look into a world that was not exposed to us before,” said Beizhan Yan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens after you swallow them is now under the microscope. A 2025 report on autopsies found &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tiny-plastic-particles-found-in-human-egg-and-sperm-fluids/"&gt;plastic particles&lt;/a&gt; lodged in human brain tissue, with higher levels than in the liver or kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work tracked particle types and sizes and suggested that nanoscale shards can cross biological barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results do not prove harm by themselves, but they demonstrate that particles can reach places where the body is most sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bacteria-rise-faster-in-water-bottles"&gt;Bacteria rise faster in water bottles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chemical story often grabs headlines, but the biological risk can be immediate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same 2005 analysis found that bacterial counts in opened bottles at room temperature rose steeply within two days, while refrigeration slowed growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern matches everyday experience. Closed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/51-percent-of-the-world-relies-on-car-commutes-every-day/"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt; heat up quickly, and warm liquid is a friendly environment for bacteria to multiply, even when the water originally started clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-daily-habits"&gt;What this means for daily habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no single number that tells you when an opened bottle becomes risky, since growth depends on temperature, time, and what entered the bottle in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safest habit is simple: throw out a bottle that sat warm for hours, and refill a clean, reusable bottle with fresh, cold water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat and light also matter for unopened bottles. Long exposures in a hot car may not make water smell or taste different, yet the bottle can still shed particles under stress, as shown in the in-vehicle study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No plastic is perfect. Harder plastics are less likely to scuff, but wear and heat still degrade them over time, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-ultraviolet-light-can-be-used-to-destroy-covid-19/"&gt;ultraviolet light&lt;/a&gt; adds stress that accelerates the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want simple rules of thumb, keep water cold, avoid leaving bottles in cars, and replace scratched or old bottles. Stainless steel or glass containers remove the plastic variable, though they still need regular cleaning to keep microbes at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plastic-water-bottles-and-false-claims"&gt;Plastic water bottles and false claims&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people worry that heating or freezing plastic bottles releases dioxins, which are cancer-causing pollutants from combustion. That claim does not apply to water bottles, a point long clarified in a Johns Hopkins interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are building better tools to count and identify the smallest particles in common beverages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The laser based method that flagged &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-normal-plastic-turns-into-dangerous-micro-and-nanoplastics/"&gt;nanoplastics&lt;/a&gt; in bottled water is now being applied to tap water and even everyday activities like laundry, which release fibers into wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the microbe side, applied food safety research continues to test how temperature and time shape growth in opened drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work supports a few steady habits, chill your water, clean your bottles, and skip any container that got warm in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40652854/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Hazardous Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 17:40:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQNlJtbkd6XzdCSDVHQmxTell5Z3dRbTFHd3VqUGVjMC1nOGNBZ3pEZVlIcXpxUVNySFdOQURJRnNMdW5FVEpPTEQ3NkZfa3oyQXE3QndiaFZxRUhIOExhWkowUFZsYV9JMjdmNzhNUlRQXzREdUtCOW9xd3RtRjFwMC1jMjNORC1ScTZXU2g5QlNfMDZLRkthdGhNaw</guid></item><item><title>已发现高血压与肠道健康之间存在深层联系： 3件可以最大限度地减少RIS的事情-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/a-deep-link-between-high-blood-pressure-and-gut-health-has-been-found-3-things-that-can-minimise-the-risk/articleshow/123661537.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, high blood pressure was seen mainly as a problem of the heart and blood vessels. But recent research has uncovered an unexpected partner in this condition, the gut. Scientists have found that the trillions of microbes living inside the digestive tract, often called the gut microbiome, may play a role in raising or lowering blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy gut produces beneficial compounds, regulates inflammation, and balances hormones. When this balance is disturbed, it may contribute to hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9863380/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;have linked an altered gut microbiome to increased risks of high blood pressure. This discovery opens a new window into prevention and management, one that begins from inside the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the gut matters in blood pressure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut is more than a digestion factory. It communicates with the brain, influences immune responses, and even helps regulate blood vessel function. When gut bacteria break down dietary fibre, they produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These compounds are known to relax blood vessels and reduce inflammation, both critical in keeping blood pressure stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, an unhealthy gut, rich in harmful bacteria and poor in diversity, can increase compounds that trigger inflammation and constrict blood vessels, silently pushing pressure upwards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dual role makes the gut a key player in cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rethinking fibre; it’s not about quantity alone&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most health advice stops at “eat more fibre,” but the truth lies in the kind of fibre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9268622/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;shows that soluble fibres, found in oats, apples, flaxseeds, and legumes, feed good bacteria more effectively than some rough insoluble fibres. Soluble fibre gets fermented in the colon, leading to the production of SCFAs that directly support blood pressure regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not about piling on bran flakes but rather about choosing fibres that nourish microbial diversity. Small swaps, such as replacing white rice with lentils or adding flaxseed to breakfast, can make a bigger difference than doubling the quantity of any fibre source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Timing of meals influences microbial rhythm&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome doesn’t just care about what goes in, it also responds to when. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6533073/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;highlight that irregular eating patterns can disrupt the circadian rhythm of gut bacteria. This imbalance is associated with higher inflammation and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a consistent meal timing, even if meals are simple, supports microbial balance. Early dinners, for instance, give gut bacteria more time to complete their metabolic cycles overnight, lowering the strain on the heart and vessels. This perspective shifts the focus from “what to eat” to “when to eat,” a habit often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="20222666" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fermented-foods" source="keywords"&gt;Fermented foods&lt;/keyword&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While probiotic capsules dominate conversations, naturally fermented foods like homemade curd, kanji, or pickles (except for some) offer a far richer spectrum of beneficial bacteria. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11500820/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;found that fermented dairy lowered blood pressure in hypertensive individuals by improving vascular elasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These foods not only reintroduce diverse microbes into the gut but also deliver bioactive peptides that relax blood vessels. Adding a small bowl of curd daily, or sipping traditional ferments during meals, can create micro shifts that, over time, lower risks linked to hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;: This article is for informational purposes only and does not replace medical advice.

   &lt;p&gt;BOWMAN, N.D. — Retta Jacobi stepped onto a metal platform that lifted her to an entrance on the side of a custom-designed semitrailer. Once inside, she lay down on a platform that technicians slid into an MRI machine. Jacobi hoped the scan would help pinpoint the source of the pain in her shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The mobile MRI unit visits Southwest Healthcare Services, the hospital in Bowman, North Dakota, each Wednesday. Without it, the community's 1,400 residents would have to drive 40 minutes to get to an MRI machine, an expensive piece of medical equipment the hospital couldn't afford on its own.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Southwest Healthcare Services and 21 other independent, rural North Dakota hospitals are part of the Rough Rider Network, which used its members' combined patient rolls to negotiate better prices for the mobile imaging truck.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-86668" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

Many are motivated by the chance to combine their patient rolls for &lt;a href="https://ruralhealthvalue.public-health.uiowa.edu/files/Intro_to_Rural_CINs.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;value-based care contracts&lt;/a&gt;, a growing reimbursement model in which insurers pay providers based on the quality of care they provide and the health outcomes of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Supporters of the networks are exploring whether funding from the $50 billion &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/rural-health-transformation-program-hospitals-medicaid-implementation-kansas/" target="_blank"&gt;Rural Health Transformation Program&lt;/a&gt; — part of President Donald Trump's recent tax and spending bill — can be used to help start or expand such organizations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For independent, rural hospitals, the networks are an alternative to shutting down or reducing services, or to giving up local autonomy and joining a large hospital system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Anything that can help our rural hospitals and add services is awesome," said Jacobi, who provides speech therapy to children in the local school district.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Closing, or courting a big buyer&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since 2010, 153 rural hospitals in the U.S. have shuttered completely or stopped offering inpatient services, &lt;a href="https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/rural-hospital-closures/" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina. A far larger number, 441, merged with or were acquired by hospital systems between 2011 and 2021. That's &lt;a href="https://strengthenhealthcare.org/new-report-finds-integration-with-a-hospital-system-can-protect-rural-hospitals-patient-access-to-care/" target="_blank"&gt;according to a report&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by the Coalition to Strengthen America's Healthcare, an advocacy group comprising hospitals and health associations.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Rough Rider Network provides negotiating leverage to its members, which serve about two-thirds of rural North Dakotans, said Dennis Goebel, CEO of the Bowman hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health care vendors "probably wouldn't be talking to us if we're by ourselves," he said. "They're not looking for the little, tiny crumbs. They want a big contract, and they'll give you better pricing."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some rural networks share specialists who aren't needed full time at any one hospital, according to &lt;a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/2023/may/how-regional-partnerships-bolster-rural-hospitals" target="_blank"&gt;the Commonwealth Fund&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit focused on improving the health care system. Some networks also invest in broadband, housing, and other community development projects that can help people stay healthy and access care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A business to create new networks&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hospitals can pool staffers for a network-wide employee health insurance plan, said Nathan White, CEO of Cibolo Health, a company that helps launch and manage networks in rural areas. He said they can also enter shared contracts for telehealth, prescription drug programs, and other services.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-86669" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;White said he started Cibolo Health after a leader from an independent, rural North Dakota hospital asked him about collaborating with similar facilities. The Rough Rider Network launched in late 2023 with assistance from the company and $3.5 million from the North Dakota Legislature.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since then, Cibolo Health has helped start networks in Minnesota, Nebraska, Montana, and Ohio. Once a sixth one opens in September, Cibolo-affiliated networks will represent more than 120 hospitals, with service areas covering 4.7 million people, White said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The networks, which are nonprofits owned by the hospitals, pay an annual fee to Cibolo Health, a for-profit company, for management services. White said leaders from 10 other states are considering joining this model.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Similar networks have been around for more than 30 years but became more popular after the passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, &lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA370-1.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to a report&lt;/a&gt; by the Rand Corp., a research nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Rural health care providers are increasingly interested in forming such networks, said Marnell Bradfield, executive director of the Community Care Alliance, a network of hospitals and independent primary care offices that launched in 2015 in rural western Colorado. About once a month, she said, she gets a call from health care leaders exploring similar networks and asking about her experience.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Rand Corp. wrote in its 2020 paper that it didn't find any academic studies that examined whether these networks do what its supporters claim — save money and improve patient care.&lt;br&gt;"In theory, quality should improve with the alignment of health care organizations, but there is no evidence," the report said. The paper also said such networks could end up increasing prices, something that can occur with traditional mergers and acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bradfield and White said they have the evidence, at least for their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Community Care Alliance members have reduced their insurance costs while improving patient outcomes, such as reducing their need for inpatient and emergency care, Bradfield said.&lt;br&gt;White said data from a pilot program between Caret Health, a care coordination company, and SMP Health-St. Kateri, one of Rough Rider's hospitals, showed the program helped a significant number of patients catch up with preventive care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-86672" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Reaching out to patients, bringing in business&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Gabby Wilkie, finance director at the St. Kateri hospital, in Rolla, N.D., near the Canadian border, said Caret Health staff called and texted patients who were behind on annual physicals, cancer screenings, vaccinations, and other visits. She said staffers explained to patients why this preventive care is important for their health before setting up a three-way call with St. Kateri staff to schedule an appointment. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;White said it took an average of 11 outreach attempts before patients came in for any visits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"To be honest, we didn't have the resources to reach out," Wilkie said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She said St. Kateri would have spent an estimated $300,000 to do that kind of outreach for 1,000 patients. Meanwhile, she said, the hospital estimates it will earn more than $100,000 when that many patients come in for their preventive care. Cibolo Health and the Rough Rider Network both contribute to the cost of the Caret Health service, which is now rolling out to other network hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Goebel said joining a network to remain independent is also beneficial for the economy of rural areas, where hospitals are often major employers. He said health systems sometimes cut services and staff at rural hospitals they acquire.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Jacobi is taking medication and doing physical therapy after a doctor examined her MRI results. If that doesn't work, she may need to make a five-hour round trip to Bismarck to get an ultrasound-guided steroid shot. Jacobi was thankful she could get a diagnosis and treatment advice without having to travel far for the MRI.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Anytime we can maintain more local control, it's a good thing for our small towns," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multinational collaboration of researchers report that psychiatric spousal resemblance across nine psychiatric disorders appears consistent and persists across birth cohorts for roughly 90 years in a sample of over 14 million.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Previous small-scale marriage registry studies have reported spousal similarities for several disorders and related psychiatric traits. A larger, population-based comparison across cultures and generations was needed to assess how widespread the phenomenon extends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Spousal correlations for nine &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychiatric+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt; are consistent across cultures and persistent over generations," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02298-z" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/i&gt;, researchers performed a large-scale analysis to quantify spousal correlations across nine psychiatric disorders and to test cultural and generational stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohorts included approximately five million spousal pairs in Taiwan, 571,534 pairs in Denmark, and published estimates from 707,263 pairs in Sweden, comprising 14.8 million individuals, with up to six million matched controls. Case counts across cohorts ranged from 1.4 million for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/major+depressive+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;major depressive disorder&lt;/a&gt; to 31,195 for anorexia nervosa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across Taiwanese couples, spousal resemblance appeared positive for every disorder pair, and estimates largely aligned with Nordic registry patterns aside from anorexia nervosa, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/obsessive+compulsive+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;obsessive compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt;, and bipolar disorder, which diverged across regions.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Generational patterns in Taiwan showed multiple substance use disorder combinations rising by birth cohort, while obsessive compulsive disorder matched within spouses declined. Sex-specific differences appeared limited, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder fluctuated without a study-defined trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parent–offspring resemblance tracked these shifts, rising for major depressive disorder and substance use disorder and falling for obsessive compulsive disorder across birth cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family risk increased when both parents shared a diagnosis for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/substance+use+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;substance use disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic covariance signals aligned with these observations, with spousal resemblance correlating with Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) derived heritability and genetic correlations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings indicate positive spousal resemblance across all nine psychiatric disorders in Taiwan, culturally consistent with Nordic estimates for most disorders and distinct for anorexia nervosa, obsessive compulsive disorder, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bipolar+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generational patterns in Taiwan persist across cohorts, aligning with elevated offspring risk when both parents have diagnoses and arguing for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+studies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic studies&lt;/a&gt;, including GWAS, to account for non-random mating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While genetics and environmental factors are typically considered to be underlying psychiatric disorders, the discovery of assortative mating adds another layer to both the genetic and developmental upbringing environment roles in acquiring a disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A dangerous, sometimes deadly, infection spread by kissing bugs is regularly spreading within America. In a recent paper, researchers are claiming that Chagas disease is endemic to parts of the southern U.S. and is probably here to stay.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in Florida, Texas, and California made the case in a paper &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last month in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. Citing evidence from infected humans, animals, and kissing bugs, they argue that Chagas has established a persistent presence in the country, albeit at low levels. Correctly recognizing that Chagas is endemic, they say, will allow us to better combat the infectious disease, which can cause chronic heart problems if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The kissing bug disease&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html"&gt;Chagas&lt;/a&gt; is caused by the parasite &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/em&gt;, and the infection is spread by various species of kissing bugs, or triatomines. As their nickname implies, kissing bugs feed by sucking blood from around a host’s mouth (or sometimes eyes). The bugs usually infect people via the poop they leave behind near a bite wound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People infected with the parasite can first experience an acute phase of flu-like illness, after which the infection enters a chronic phase if left untreated. Most people avoid any symptoms in either phase, but up to a third of people with chronic Chagas disease will eventually experience serious health problems, such as an enlarged heart and colon. People can also die from heart failure or sudden cardiac arrest as a result of the infection. It can take years and even decades for these chronic symptoms to appear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 8 million people worldwide are thought to have Chagas, including 280,000 in the United States. Most of these U.S. cases were caught elsewhere, particularly in parts of Central and South America where &lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; is locally circulating. But the researchers present evidence that the parasite has probably made a cozy home within the southern U.S. as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why Chagas should be seen as endemic&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For starters, there have likely been locally acquired (autochthonous) human cases of Chagas documented in at least eight states, including Texas, California, and Florida. These cases are typically found in people with no relevant travel history or other risk factor for having caught the parasite outside of the area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_2000651958" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651958" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2000651958" src="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/24-1700-F1.jpg" alt="24 1700 F1" srcset="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/24-1700-F1.jpg 900w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/24-1700-F1-336x206.jpg 336w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/24-1700-F1-768x471.jpg 768w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/24-1700-F1-672x412.jpg 672w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 1258px) calc((100vw - 3.68rem) * 2 / 3), 800px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651958" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A map showing where the Chagas parasite has been found in local human, animal, and kissing bug populations. © Beatty, et al/Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers additionally note that southern U.S. states are known to have several kissing bug species that can theoretically carry and transmit the &lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; parasite, including species that will regularly invade human dwellings.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;And studies have detected the parasite circulating among local kissing bug populations. Just last July, for example, researchers &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/kissing-bugs-are-creeping-into-florida-homes-and-theyre-carrying-a-dangerous-parasite-2000627551"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that a third of kissing bugs collected in Florida carried the parasite. The parasite has also been &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-animal-013120-043949"&gt;commonly found&lt;/a&gt; in local wildlife, captive animals, and pets (dogs in particular), providing a reservoir for it to survive in the environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of these bits of data together point to a single conclusion. “&lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; and the ecologic conditions that sustain its transmission cycles are naturally occurring throughout the southern half of the United States,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A low-level but persistent threat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The one silver lining is that Chagas is likely hypoendemic to the southern U.S., the researchers say, meaning it’s only present in low levels. But as things stand now, we’re largely fighting blind against it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chagas disease in people is not a nationally notifiable condition, so doctors in most places aren’t obligated to report cases to their health departments, the researchers point out. It is notifiable in some of the states where local cases have been found, but not all (in California, only two counties require notice).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While Chagas might not be as huge an issue in the U.S. as it is in other parts of the Americas, classifying it as endemic will allow scientists to better track its distribution and range, the researchers say. Improved awareness of the disease will also make it easier for infected people to get the timely care they need before their infection turns into something more serious and potentially life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

            For Henry Cockburn, the onset of schizophrenia felt like pure common sense.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4gxe600063b6nzs5h14lj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was February 2002, and the 20-year-old art student had strayed from the University of Brighton to satisfy his desire for a life of magic outside the city. He also wanted to take a 70-mile journey (about 113 kilometers) barefoot back to his childhood home in Canterbury.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4gxe600073b6n00ts3j74@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 15 miles (24 kilometers) into his walk, he heard planes in the distance, and told CNN he believed “that somehow an evil force knew I had left.” Cockburn knew with absolute certainty that he was being followed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4gxe700083b6nwwbt4s66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The solution, he believed, was to dive into the frigid tidal waters of the Newhaven Estuary and swim away from the malevolent presence. Fishermen found him and rescued him just before he blacked out from hypothermia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4gxe700093b6nolph6xmo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After being revived in a general hospital, he was transferred to a psychiatric hospital, where doctors diagnosed him with schizophrenia. The institution was the first of several where he would spend the next eight years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Schizophrenia is simultaneously one of the most famous mental illnesses and one of the most misunderstood.

Cockburn’s case reflects a typical pattern of onset: in early adulthood, a psychological break into false beliefs, hallucinations and paranoia, all of which escalate over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmesxssze00003b6nt7c6rlqg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I saw it as more of a spiritual awakening and not paranoid schizophrenia,” Cockburn recalled. “It almost felt like I was on the run, and if you’re part of the system and you take yourself out of the system, the system doesn’t like that.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000g3b6n3jvr49t6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was kind of cross and angry, like, ‘Why can’t people understand me?’” Cockburn added. “I can sort of see their point of view a bit more now.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000h3b6nxtdgu9nf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Part of the confusion about schizophrenia may originate from the name of the disorder itself. Coined by Swiss psychiatrist Dr. Paul Eugen Bleuler in 1908, “schizophrenia” derives from the Greek words “schizo,” meaning “split,” and “phrene,” or “mind.” To describe the severe social withdrawal of some patients with schizophrenia, Bleuler also &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Farticles%2FPMC3757918%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571633403%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=vWvd4%2BfTUPhlByN0FCoBtiI3OAr%2Fta%2FjPVRRKmotu48%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;devised the term “autism&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000i3b6nmjpgkt42@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the early 20th century, Bleuler proposed that the disorder was marked by a “splitting of psychological functions” by which “the personality loses its unity.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000j3b6n8xg8ojaz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The idea that schizophrenia means a split mind has contributed to a widespread belief in more formal contexts that the condition is like &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.clevelandclinic.org%2Fhealth%2Fdiseases%2F9792-dissociative-identity-disorder-multiple-personality-disorder&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571651706%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=lOduwMGjdvmJ3YeelW8YC2tPcUqY0Rk%2Fde39LwsikEc%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;dissociative identity disorder&lt;/a&gt;, previously called split or multiple personality disorder, said Dr. Daniel Weinberger, director and CEO of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development. Dissociative identity disorder, &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.clevelandclinic.org%2Fhealth%2Fdiseases%2F9792-dissociative-identity-disorder-multiple-personality-disorder&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571670477%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=%2BjtrkyrqeyIreg40OenJw7bFM75hodlCQkwHmWLIPzY%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;caused by trauma&lt;/a&gt;, is when two or more distinctive personalities control a person’s behavior, causing gaps in memory when the personalities switch off.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000k3b6nfqf8wqzc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beyond those misperceptions about its underlying nature, schizophrenia is one of the most heavily stigmatized mental health disorders, said Dr. Deepak D’Souza, Vikram Sodhi ’92 Professor of Psychiatry and director of the Schizophrenia Neuropharmacology Research Group at Yale University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000l3b6nkf1dxow0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s a widespread stereotype that people with schizophrenia are a threat to others — “the homeless person walking barefoot in the winter screaming at no one in particular (or the) mass murderer compelled by their symptoms to kill strangers,” said Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, the Lawrence C. Kolb Professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000m3b6njg2nu3t6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s the condition that people “associate with madness and psychosis and lunacy,” said Lieberman, who is the author of “&lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Malady-of-the-Mind/Jeffrey-A-Lieberman/9781982136420" target="_blank"&gt;Malady of the Mind&lt;/a&gt;: Schizophrenia and the Path to Prevention.” While some of these stereotypes are based in true symptoms that some patients experience, they aren’t reflective of all patients and can prevent a holistic, compassionate view of schizophrenia as a treatable disorder that’s usually more harmful to the patient than to others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000n3b6nxtszvbc0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The way society has dealt with it — from ancient times through medieval times, even until the 21st century — is to ostracize or segregate people with these severe mental disorders,” Lieberman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000o3b6nmgh3rf57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To make matters worse, among people who don’t have schizophrenia, there’s also the popular colloquial use of “schizophrenic” or “schizo” to describe feeling self-contradictory or frazzled by having multiple stressors or responsibilities simultaneously.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000p3b6ni4ir2zil@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Misperceptions and fears about schizophrenia can make it difficult for people to recognize its signs and seek help for themselves or others, experts say. That help is critical since the disorder is associated with co-occurring mental health issues, a lower quality of life and life expectancy, and higher rates of disability, according to the &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nimh.nih.gov%2Fhealth%2Fstatistics%2Fschizophrenia&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571686990%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=v9XMvTZvvOYxdtxfK3G9YHwWYhLGOAMvLXqiESmGg7g%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;National Institute of Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;.

            Symptoms of schizophrenia typically begin between the ages of 15 and 25, experts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            People might have been doing OK or even great in their lives, and then suddenly they have what experts call a “first break” in their capacity to function normally, said Weinberger, also a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetic medicine at the Johns Hopkins University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “To me, (schizophrenia) is the most devastating of mental illnesses — because it strikes before a person reaches their potential,” D’Souza said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000t3b6nq1ujl03q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Research suggests this disruption may stem from alterations in normal &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Farticles%2FPMC3080672%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571735713%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=PEZbs4WQhXgiX8XTRixOaion2YeqV4bQF3gLReQ8SAI%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;neurodevelopmental processes&lt;/a&gt; that happen as adolescents mature — especially since the higher end of the typical age range of onset is when the brain completes maturation, D’Souza said. But for some people, the stage for such changes may be set as early as infancy and require 20 years of brain maturation for the effects to become obvious, Weinberger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000u3b6nqviqf69o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are forms of schizophrenia that can begin earlier, but it’s rare, D’Souza said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000v3b6n37ic7uzf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Schizophrenia predominantly occurs in males, he added. Still, “there’s an interesting second peak in the rates of schizophrenia that occurs &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Farticles%2FPMC5688947%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571752085%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=8jk8C7sqfFG%2BtPemeMQYktiNlHoc7Zvat6yRzNM4%2BCA%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;in the early 50s&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s predominantly among women,” D’Souza said. “It’s thought to be related to menopause.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000w3b6n79jfrcvz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What directly causes schizophrenia isn’t clear, but there are several known risk factors, Weinberger said. Those include brain chemistry and genetics that increase the likelihood that, with enough risk factors accumulated, someone will develop the disorder. Many neuroimaging studies have also shown structural abnormalities in the brains of people with schizophrenia, but nothing consistent enough across patient populations to become signature features of the disorder.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn000x3b6nhc08wfp9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A pregnancy complicated by factors such as preeclampsia, prolonged labor or low birth weight can double a child’s risk, Weinberger said. Stress and trauma can also &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fschizophrenia%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20354443&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571768194%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=uoysOQ8ur7WiN1nDYKvZ92VwBJGLFVB0pCmet1Ojm8A%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;increase one’s likelihood&lt;/a&gt; of schizophrenia.

            Taking mind-altering drugs as a teen or young adult is another risk factor, and researchers have increasingly been finding associations between &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2021%2F07%2F22%2Fhealth%2Fmarijuana-schizophrenia-study-wellness&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571784439%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=jeCN1eKgPZOtA4eoSb%2Fn8B284EK7rojYJ9IKRTT8QEs%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;cannabis use and schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;.

            When Cockburn was diagnosed after his swimming episode at age 20, he had just quit using marijuana about four days weekly and alcohol two or three days weekly since he was 14 years old, he said. Cockburn doesn’t think drug use caused his schizophrenia, but he had also started behaving unusually — walking barefoot in the winter — before he got sober.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn00113b6n4ufikqk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The active chemicals in cannabis mimic natural brain molecules called endocannabinoids, which stimulate cannabinoid receptors — together, these two elements represent the &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.harvard.edu%2Fblog%2Fthe-endocannabinoid-system-essential-and-mysterious-202108112569&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571835444%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=WOCDRWWDiFwpFfG9hRUMHvjN1Gqbw61Cl7hWJkfdC%2BM%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;brain’s endocannabinoid system&lt;/a&gt;. The system is not there to facilitate getting high, D’Souza said, but to help regulate the levels and activities of neurotransmitters that affect our mood, learning, body temperature and more. It also has a critical role in neurodevelopment, controlling where some neurons migrate to, which ones are removed and whether any are unhealthily disrupted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn00123b6nqow7xefs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Imagine that this &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.harvard.edu%2Fblog%2Fthe-endocannabinoid-system-essential-and-mysterious-202108112569&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571852364%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=vwVvEqv3qXXkRApN1rZzpFb3afr3mdpZVfr8nXHI98s%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;endocannabinoid system&lt;/a&gt; is working normally, and then it’s bombarded with THC,” D’Souza said. That’s the compound delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the major active ingredient in cannabis thought to be responsible for the psychoactive effects of use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn00133b6neygpzmma@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Weinberger thinks the cannabis-schizophrenia research is controversial, as cause and effect can’t be inferred from associations, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn00143b6n61bpjaiw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the idea isn’t a new one, D’Souza said, citing 19th-century work by French psychiatrist Dr. Jacques Joseph Moreau. Moreau detailed &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fabs%2Fpii%2FS0074774206780102&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571869359%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=bC0e5M068fKdsvOvCQWEvtvkMjej4zk4FByOCuLIGak%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;users of hashish&lt;/a&gt; experiencing delusions, hallucinations and paranoia — all things now associated with schizophrenia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn00153b6no5aybxmg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are several categories of schizophrenia symptoms, and they can affect how people feel, think and act.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn00163b6nzl3engxd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Delusions, or believing in things that aren’t true or real, and acting on them are common. They can be “extremely unsettling, tormenting and very disabling,” Weinberger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn00173b6npjjy8rdd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Someone with delusions may think the Central Intelligence Agency has infiltrated their phone to spy on them, Weinberger said, and thus remove the phone’s battery. Cockburn said that this past spring, he was reading the C.S. Lewis novel “The Magician’s Nephew” and became fascinated with Aslan the lion’s ability to sing the world of Narnia into creation from a dark void.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn00183b6nh455wtx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I thought that was how the world began,” Cockburn said. “I read fantasy books and then look for the fantasy within the reality of this world.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn00193b6nf68lkb2s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cockburn also felt that plants and birds could talk to him, and that he could “converse with the spirits,” he added. A conversation with a tree had a big impact on him: “It told me I could rap, and that’s what I started getting into after that happened.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn001a3b6nauvdhbuk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During some of Cockburn’s escapes from psychiatric hospitals — a habit that led to admission to five or six mental hospitals over those eight years — he would strip naked and explore a forest on a snowy day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn001b3b6n3wqhrwf2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many people with schizophrenia also have hallucinations, such as talking to someone who isn’t there, Weinberger said. Cockburn sometimes saw snipers outside the window of his hospital room, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn001c3b6n1k0689y7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Delusions and hallucinations can lead to fear and paranoia, Weinberger said. That paranoia can make patients think others are talking about them, plotting against them, or affecting or reading the thoughts in their own brains — which “makes them very uncomfortable in public settings, because they feel they’re not safe,” he added. “Most individuals with schizophrenia are much more likely to feel that they’re unsafe than they are to make you feel that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn001d3b6nqqmsac3l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hallucinations also commonly take the form of voices that can sometimes start out benign and darken over time, experts said. Many patients often hear multiple voices carrying on a conversation about them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4msnn001e3b6nzye18ybk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When voices told Cockburn that “there was no redemption for me,” he recalled, “I would have really bad days where I felt I was being sucked into a godless world, I suppose, and my mood would go down.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4mrai000e3b6n8z0vexpc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Voices can also command someone to perform actions that are difficult to resist, even when they’re self-destructive, Weinberger said. Probably &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Farticles%2FPMC1845151%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571902845%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=XGNr5U%2Fzr5lOYKH0VmiOBY5kn4BvrapBnOHwL%2BF8gCs%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;5% to 13%&lt;/a&gt; of patients die by suicide, and sometimes that’s due to following hallucinated orders to perform lethal actions, Weinberger added.

            In neuroimaging studies of patients hearing voices, “areas of the brain that are responsible for language and speech generation are lighting up,” D’Souza explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            People with schizophrenia can have cognitive deficits such as difficulty creating and following a plan, processing complicated information, or using information to reach appropriate conclusions, Weinberger said. Disorganized speech, unusual movements and a lack of motivation are other common symptoms — as is social isolation, which Cockburn had begun to exhibit before his first hospitalization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4o3ch001s3b6n8g6ol62f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Schizophrenia is a very disabling problem,” Weinberger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Schizophrenia cannot be cured, Lieberman said, but it can be substantially alleviated with a combination of &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fschizophrenia%2Fdiagnosis-treatment%2Fdrc-20354449&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571918664%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=KMJWkIWl6NujfqBQwnhFHzl9LNqwHTo%2FdCnEOlycvOU%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;medications and therapies&lt;/a&gt; — though accessing multidisciplinary care and getting insurance to cover it remain difficult, even for the health care providers wanting to provide such resources for their patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4o3ch001v3b6nc7zxsbtx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The most effective drugs for patients are antipsychotics, Lieberman said, since those medications &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.clevelandclinic.org%2Fhealth%2Ftreatments%2F24692-antipsychotic-medications&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571934565%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=3H%2BoXTCAjLn9JW6U%2Fo4qZSBvPdWY%2FbmEbd8QnZAj8CQ%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;manage the elements&lt;/a&gt; of psychosis that impair thoughts and perceptions. The cognitive difficulties are harder to treat, Weinberger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4o3ch001w3b6n0b6gj7c4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the same time, Weinberger added, the greatest treatment obstacle is patients not taking their medications — sometimes due to anosognosia, the &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nami.org%2Fabout-mental-illness%2Fcommon-with-mental-illness%2Fanosognosia%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571950457%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=UBbhP1AzDrpTynnKRPOWUjDQRZ1HDFlDztAM5M2%2Bp1U%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;unawareness of being ill&lt;/a&gt;, which affects 50% to 98% of people with schizophrenia. Other times, nonadherence results from the medicine’s uncomfortable side effects. But now that experts better understand some causal factors of schizophrenia, other drugs &lt;a href="https://info.thelancet.com/e3t/Ctc/RF+113/cs6tF04/VWCXBV8mKV--W6svZxF4Jd0c9W2F3lfm5xBfCFN2dmMxz3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3psW7bcCBD1_xCl7W20wsmb2lm2LsW7MT-KL5DGNmxN6PyNNBQpdYnW8LB7ns30JNBhW1pHHmb7nb4GTW1Qyjrp5YMkCCW1ZcDn95TNNFqN675bf231m84W2_9C7k9kWWytW4L7BL75kV9nSW3Hk8Jb6_FtfgN1TFFq1fbrP9W4RpS0934t9n4W2N003_5k3jPNW1gM1lV4z6KyzW8S7ylF42-k44W17BztH4qjV7XW1q_ZK04G3jqqW4tnFW98xT6_HVJkz1h3x4XXNW3WNZVX5qpbHbW7M4VqG88JRLKW5B9Nxx2pX94nN6MDzLQFtT0qW5mwJKX4GhLPSW8trjhr4kw0ngW3vb4b76MvtH3f18-80C04" target="_blank"&gt;currently being studied&lt;/a&gt; or developed should be much more effective with fewer side effects, Weinberger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4o3ch001x3b6n2kg077u1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Effective therapies include talk therapy, social skills training and &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mountsinai.org%2Fcare%2Fpsychiatry%2Fservices%2Fschizophrenia%2Ftreatment%2Fcbtp&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571967416%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=Lhk2mwc4BDGmyj6eilkRjvYmlonHZRyDhztiSJZgn5s%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; for psychosis, Weinberger and D’Souza said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;With comprehensive treatment, patients can learn to dismiss or respond to urges or voices in healthier ways.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4o3ch001y3b6ndprqiuu4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since Cockburn was discharged from his last hospital in 2011, he has largely accomplished just this, thanks to CBT for psychosis, medications and counseling. Just before his interview with CNN, he had gone on a run. He felt something beyond himself urging him to run further than he usually does, but instead of obeying, he turned around, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4o3ch001z3b6nfe46ds3z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I felt a little bit guilt-ridden for it,” Cockburn said. “But then as I got towards the end of the run, I realized that I wouldn’t have been able to finish it if I hadn’t turned back at that moment. I guess common sense got the better of me.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmet4o3ch00203b6ns9cq17r4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dating is nonexistent for Cockburn, he said, but he has close friends and family and lives with a roommate in England. He’s on government disability benefits, but also sometimes makes a living from his paintings. He still gets panic attacks occasionally, but the comforting stillness of sitting in a dark, cool room helps them pass. Cockburn has also finished his bachelor’s degree and tries to dwell more on the good in life than the bad.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In 2011, he cowrote a memoir with his father, journalist Patrick Cockburn, titled “&lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHenrys-Demons-Father-Journey-Madness%2Fdp%2F1439154716&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432571985453%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=1mIJqQnER2W2RufpKnh5v60B6QImLKfDdX6t1h2h27g%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;Henry’s Demons&lt;/a&gt;: A Father and Son’s Journey Out of Madness.” The book was shortlisted for a prize by the now-defunct Costa Book Awards and dramatized into a radio &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fprogrammes%2Fb0150mld&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckristen.rogers%40cnn.com%7C4e9c75e6391e46e3f91b08dde4ede3db%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638918432572002687%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=wTFFGnnik5svzz2sWGeQoSJl8m47EE%2FznuGsKvsSkhs%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;play for BBC Radio 4&lt;/a&gt;.

I have become a selectively gullible person – disillusioned with mainstream medicine, waiting for a cure, sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of an infrared light panel wearing nothing but a pair of protective wraparound sunglasses and hoping for the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I contracted Covid-19 at a Harry Styles concert in June 2022.

At times, a five-minute phone conversation has sent me to bed for days. I’d have to rest halfway up a small set of stairs. I’d answer a single email then slip into a sleep that felt much closer to a coma than a nap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When things are that grim, the promises made by the wellness industry sound very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; appealing. An industry worth &lt;a href="https://globalwellnessinstitute.org/press-room/statistics-and-facts/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$6.3tn globally&lt;/a&gt;, with some of the most diabolically persuasive advocates available – celebrities, influencers, internet strangers, a friend’s sister’s boyfriend’s colleague who swears this one supplement made him better in a week. I shudder to think what my own contribution to that figure has been – and I will not be voluntarily doing maths to find out. I’ve been through enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Whenever someone recommends something new, I haven’t had it in me to ask “where’s the rigorous scientific proof of this thing’s efficacy?” when I’ve had “help me! I will do anything to feel well” playing inside my head on a loop for thousands of days. Sometimes this is fine, even great – there are many alternative things that really work for me – I love my acupuncturist! Somatic dance! Shiatsu!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other times, it’s been more sinister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During the screening call for a wellness program I now believe to be at best a pyramid scheme, at worst a cult, I was asked if I felt able to “put aside” my “critical thinking” before they signed me up.

Now I feel extremely protective of other people like me, too sick to necessarily have the clarity of mind to tell the false promises of wellness culture from the legit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What else? I’ve done 90-minute sessions lying in a sealed hyperbaric oxygen chamber, which felt somewhat like road-testing my own coffin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A small, frighteningly positive man poked my spine and pulled my arms and pummelled my back while he bellowed things like “your immune system works perfectly”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I’ve submerged myself in ice-cold bath tubs. Sweated in saunas. Let a man strike a drum balanced on my belly so the vibrations would stimulate my cells. Stirred mushroom powders into hot water for an alleged boost to my cognitive function. Prodded my collar bones, armpits and groin to drain my lymphatic system. Had my chakras realigned. Asked a psychic what to do. Drunk what must now be gallons of celery juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="fbc2b14d-6edf-4056-8a65-9f9658449774" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":19,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I do aqua aerobics with women in their 80s – it’s the most fun I’ve had exercising | Kate Leaver","elementId":"fbc2b14d-6edf-4056-8a65-9f9658449774","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/13/i-do-aqua-aerobics-with-women-in-their-80s-its-the-most-fun-ive-had-exercising"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All of these things exist on a spectrum of efficacy and intentions – from a floret of kale to a full-blown cult. We will each have our own quota of what we are able to believe. On hard days, I still worry I’m too vulnerable and not discerning enough. On better days, I’m just grateful to have things to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Recently I’ve been going outside first thing, to ask the sun to set my circadian rhythm. I down a pint of water and electrolytes. Place a little device that looks like a high-end sex toy on my sternum to stimulate my vagus nerve. Stand on a vibration plate to move muscles that may otherwise atrophy after roughly 900 days of lying down. Dance aggressively to a Selena Gomez-heavy playlist to release trapped emotion from my body. Put my legs up a wall at every possible opportunity. And guzzle a handful of supplements, thinking to myself, &lt;em&gt;at the very least, maybe I can have some placebo effect, as a little treat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Do I think these things have helped? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Am I sure about that? No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But what else can I do? There is no treatment protocol, no known cure for long Covid.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from Trinity College Dublin have discovered that electrically stimulating macrophages—one of the immune systems key players—can reprogram them in such a way as to reduce inflammation and encourage faster, more effective healing in disease and injury.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;This breakthrough uncovers a potentially powerful new therapeutic option, with further work ongoing to delineate the specifics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophages are a type of white blood cell with several high-profile roles in our immune system. They patrol around the body, surveying for bugs and viruses, as well as disposing of dead and damaged cells, and stimulating other &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt;—kicking them into gear when and where they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, their actions can also drive local inflammation in the body, which can sometimes get out of control and become problematic, causing more damage to the body than repair. This is present in lots of different diseases, highlighting the need to regulate macrophages for improved patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Cell Reports Physical Science&lt;/i&gt;, the Trinity team worked with human macrophages isolated from healthy donor blood samples provided via the Irish Blood Transfusion Board, St James's Hospital. They stimulated these cells using a custom bioreactor to apply electrical currents and measured what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists discovered that this stimulation caused a shift of macrophages into an anti-inflammatory state that supports faster tissue repair; a decrease in inflammatory marker (signaling) activity; an increase in expression of genes that promote the formation of new blood vessels (associated with tissue repair as new tissues form); and an increase in stem cell recruitment into wounds (also associated with tissue repair).&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"We have known for a very long time that the immune system is vital for repairing damage in our body and that macrophages play a central role in fighting infection and guiding &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tissue+repair/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tissue repair&lt;/a&gt;," said Dr. Sinead O'Rourke, Research Fellow in Trinity's School of Biochemistry and Immunology, and first author of the research article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a result, many scientists are exploring ways to 'reprogram' macrophages to encourage faster, more effective healing in disease and to limit the unwanted side effects that come with overly aggressive inflammation. And while there is growing evidence that electrical stimulation may help control how different cells behave during &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/wound+healing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;wound healing&lt;/a&gt;, very little was known about how it affects human macrophages prior to this work."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are really excited by the findings. Not only does this study show for the first time that electrical stimulation can shift human macrophages to suppress inflammation, we have also demonstrated the increased ability of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/macrophages/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;macrophages&lt;/a&gt; to repair tissue, supporting electrical stimulation as an exciting new therapy to boost the body's own repair processes in a huge range of different injury and disease situations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings from the interdisciplinary team led by Trinity investigators, Professor Aisling Dunne (School of Biochemistry and Immunology) and Professor Michael Monaghan (School of Engineering) are especially significant given that this work was performed with human blood cells (showing its effectiveness in real patients). Electrical stimulation is relatively safe and easy in the scheme of therapeutic options, and the outcomes should be applicable to a wide range of scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corresponding author Prof. Monaghan added, "Among the future steps are to explore more advanced regimes of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electrical+stimulation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electrical stimulation&lt;/a&gt; to generate more precise and prolonged effects on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/inflammatory+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;inflammatory cells&lt;/a&gt; and to explore new materials and modalities of delivering electric fields. This concept has yielded compelling effects in vitro and has huge potential in a wide range of inflammatory diseases."&lt;/p&gt;

Whether it's a deadline at work, a difficult-conversation, or just trying to stay on top of daily tasks, pressure is inevitable and along with pressure comes undulating stress. We all try to address stress through the big-ticket items, like sleep, exercise, or meditation. But there is one little habit that may be influencing how we respond to stress more than we know — 'staying properly hydrated'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study indicates that even mild dehydration may put a stress burden on the body, making you more likely to develop long-term health problems. It's a reminder that hydration is not merely about quenching our thrist but also it helps calm our minds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of researchers at&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/news/articles/2025/8/22/dehydration-and-stress-study" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; Liverpool John Moores University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (LJMU) recently investigated the relationship between &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/japplphysiol.00408.2025" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;hydration and stress.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined the impact of fluid consumption on cortisol, the key stress hormone in the body. They discovered that individuals who consumed less than 1.5 litres of fluid per day, about the level found in seven cups of tea, had a cortisol increase that was more than 50 percent greater when stressed compared to individuals consuming sufficient water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is important because prolonged high levels of cortisol are associated with serious health issues, such as heart disease, diabetes, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the study entail&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gain a better idea, scientists categorized healthy young adults according to their typical daily fluid consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one group, people had less than 1.5 litres of fluid regularly. The other group maintained the recommended daily levels of 2 litres for women and 2.5 litres for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one week, the participants maintained their regular consumption of alcohol while providing blood and urine samples for the measurement of hydration status. They were then requested to undertake a test of stress by undergoing a simulated job interview and solving mental arithmetic questions under time constraints at the conclusion of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though both groups were equally anxious and their heart rate responded similarly to the test, the group that consumed less water had a more intense cortisol response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is this important to our health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol isn't entirely an evil-stress hormone, it assists the body in reacting to immediate danger as well. However, when cortisol remains elevated too frequently, it can be more harm than help. Chronic elevation of stress hormones is associated with a multitude of medical conditions, including high blood pressure, weight gain, mood disorders, and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As explained by Professor Neil Walsh, the lead researcher, "Cortisol is the body's main stress hormone and heightened cortisol reactivity to stress is related to increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more surprisingly, the under-hydrated individuals did not perceive themselves as thirstier than the hydrated group. Their only true indication of dehydration was in their urine, which was more concentrated. This indicates that we cannot trust only thirst to inform us that we need additional water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much to drink?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daily recommended intake is approximately 2 litres for women and 2.5 litres for men. This may consist of water and also fluid from tea, coffee, and other beverages. High water content foods like fruits and vegetables contribute to fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trick is to notice not only thirst, but habits. If you find you frequently go all day without a drink, or if your urine is dark yellow, that can be an indication you're not drinking enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydration is one of the simplest and most neglected ways to help both your mental and physical well-being.

Some &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/los-angeles" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Los Angeles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Los Angeles &lt;/a&gt;hotspots, including Griffith Park, are teeming with bugs infected with the Chagas disease parasite. A third of all kissing bugs at the famous park and observatory carry the parasite, and the disease has been detected in local wildlife, including wood rats, skunks and mice, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This is a disease that has been neglected and has been impacting Latin Americans for many decades,” Norman Beatty, an epidemiologist and Chagas disease expert, told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. “But it’s also here in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 100,000 Californians have been infected with Chagas disease, caused by kissing bugs, according to a report. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Due to its prevalence in the U.S., researchers are now calling on the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to classify the disease as endemic, which means it is consistently present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;California has more residents who have been infected with Chagas disease, which is caused by the parasite &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/em&gt;, than any other state, in part due to there being so many residents who come from countries where the disease is endemic, according to the report. A study by California’s Department of Health found that 31 of 40 human cases reported between 2013 and 2023 were acquired in other countries. Officials could not rule out local transmission for the remaining cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the disease was once only found in more rural parts of Mexico and Central and South America, it is now present in at least 30 U.S. states. About 8 million people globally and an estimated 280,000 in the U.S. have Chagas disease without even knowing it, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doctors and physicians are not required to report cases of the disease in California, as they would have to for other diseases such as influenza, Lyme and malaria, meaning cases are likely vastly underreported. Gabriel Hamer, an entomologist, told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that confirmed human cases in the U.S. represent “just the tip of the iceberg,” and that no one truly knows the true total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There’s no standardized reporting system. There’s no active surveillance,” Hamer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Hamer, many people only discover they have Chagas after trying to donate blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chagas can cause acute reactions, including swollen limbs, eyes and anaphylaxis, though its longer-term effects, such as seizures or strokes, are much more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other symptoms include fever, feeling tired, body aches, headaches, rash, a loss of appetite, diarrhea, vomiting and eyelid swelling. These symptoms may be mild but would appear in the first weeks or months after infection, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The disease, while curable if antiparasitic treatment is provided early on, can often lead to sometimes fatal cardiac issues, including heart attacks or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Canada</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 14:12:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxPaVNzbkdOTDhqOEZjM25ETks4eEpVXzhncjcxU2tKU2M2Sl9CMWt3eGM0SW5CVjRFQ0kwb1VaaUR5OTAzQmNocFM3UkVjamNpWmVMWG1tVS1TZjZ6YUlFX1EwaWNmdm1rckRPS3pIMGZUeHB5aUxYMXR5UzlfOThiV1dkMnhOUQ</guid></item><item><title>我以为我的眼睛疼痛是因为屏幕时间过长……这是一种令人痛苦的疾病的第一个迹象--《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-15054967/woman-eye-pain-multiple-sclerosis-symptom-sign.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A woman who thought her eye pain was from too much screen time has revealed how she discovered that it was actually the first sign that she was battling a harrowing disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amanda Hahn, 29, from New York, said there were little clues for years that something was wrong with her - including memory problems and random bouts of numbness - but she 'brushed them off.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first big symptom that 'made her pause' was a 'sharp pain in her eye' whenever she 'looked down and to the side.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, it didn't occur to her that it was something serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At first, I blamed it on my job.

It felt natural to assume it was just eye strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've always been the type to brush off little health things like, "Oh, it's nothing." So the idea that it could be something serious didn't even cross my mind.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when her vision 'started to change' in 2019, she finally decided it was time to go to the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A woman who thought her eye pain was from too much screen time has revealed how she discovered that it was actually the first sign that she was battling a harrowing disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amanda Hahn, 29, from New York, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Things looked blurry, colors seemed off, and my eye just didn't feel right,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I knew it wasn't just screen fatigue anymore. That's when I went to the eye doctor - and everything escalated quickly from there.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After examining her, the eye doctor suggested she go to the ER for an MRI, and she soon learned that she was battling multiple sclerosis (MS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was completely in shock. My parents were out of the country at the time, and I had spent the entire day in the ER waiting for my MRI and the results,' she recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When a nurse finally came in, she just handed me a pamphlet and said, "This is what your life will look like in 10 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Honestly, I didn't even believe her at first. My mom also has MS, so I was confused... how could this really be happening to me too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I ended up going to several other doctors just to confirm the diagnosis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She said there were little clues for years that something was wrong with her - including memory problems and random bouts of numbness - but she 'brushed them off'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The first big symptom that 'made her pause' was a 'sharp pain in her eye' whenever she 'looked down and to the side'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She said, 'When I am not glued to my computer screen, I am on my phone.

They found remnants of the human pegavirus (HPgV) in half of all brains with Parkinson's and none in those without the degenerative disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients with the virus had distinct immune responses and advanced brain changes, which were further impacted by genetic mutations. Parkinson's gets worse over time, gradually degrading the part of the brain that produces dopamine, a chemical critical for controlling movement, which causes tremors, stiffness, and falls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with Parkinson's who had the virus in their brains showed more advanced brain damage. Those who had the virus in their blood also showed signs that their cells were struggling to produce energy and clean out damaged parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HPgV is spread through blood and is a close relative of the Hepatitis C virus. However, unlike Hepatitis C, HPgV was not previously believed to cause any illness and was thought to lie dormant in the body. This latest study challenges that assumption, suggesting it may play a role in Parkinson's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Igor Koralnik, chief of neuroinfectious diseases and global neurology at Northwestern Medicine, said in a statement: ‘For a virus that was thought to be harmless, these findings suggest it may have important effects, in the context of Parkinson’s disease. It may influence how Parkinson’s develops, especially in people with certain genetic backgrounds.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact cause of Parkinson’s, which affects about one million Americans and also causes trouble walking and cognitive problems, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14800655/The-huge-Parkinsons-risk-linked-you-LIVE-worse-upmarket-areas-Experts-reveal-risk.html"&gt;is still unknown&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have been researching &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13856205/Doctors-environmental-cause-Parkinsons-young.html"&gt;possible contributors&lt;/a&gt; for years, and viruses are among several possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the brain detects a virus, it triggers inflammation as a defense mechanism. While this is meant to fight the infection, chronic or overzealous inflammation can accidentally damage or kill delicate brain cells, including the dopamine-producing neurons whose death is characteristic of Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Michael J Fox, pictured in April 2025, is one of the most high-profile Parkinson's sufferers. He founded The Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, which has been responsible for landmark research into the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the blood analysis, researchers turned to a library of samples from over 1,000 participants in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), a major study launched by The Michael J. Fox Foundation to accelerate research and treatment discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists analyzed the brain tissue of 24 deceased individuals. Ten of them had Parkinson's when they died, and 14 did not. They detected the virus in half of the Parkinson's brains and in none of the brains from the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HPgV is a common, symptomless infection previously not known to infect the brain. As of 2024, studies estimate that about four percent of Americans have an active HPgV infection, and up to 12 percent have been exposed to the virus at some point in their lives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The primary route of transmission is through exposure to infected blood, such as from shared needles or, historically, through blood transfusions before widespread screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In patients with a specific Parkinson’s-related gene mutation, LRRK2, the body’s immune system reacted more aggressively to the virus compared to Parkinson’s patients without the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gene mutation rewired the brain's immune circuitry when the virus was present in the blood, leading to a dysfunctional and harmful inflammatory response that would not have happened if the person had either the virus or the gene mutation alone, but not both together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ensuing inflammation in the brain led to brain damage that contributed to Parkinson's. It damages and kills neurons, particularly the dopamine-producing cells in the brain region known as the substantia nigra, a hallmark of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We were surprised to find it in the brains of Parkinson’s patients at such high frequency and not in the controls,’ Dr Koralnik said. ‘Even more unexpected was how the immune system responded differently, depending on a person’s genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The little-known group of conditions can lead to Parkinson's disease, the fresh study revealed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This suggests it could be an environmental factor that interacts with the body in ways we didn’t realize before.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also detected the virus in the spinal fluid of Parkinson's patients, but not in those without the neurological disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Parkinson’s disease, the area of the brain that produces dopamine begins to deteriorate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to playing a crucial role in the brain’s reward system, dopamine is key to the brain's movement control system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without sufficient dopamine, the brain's movement circuit becomes impaired, leading to stiffness and tremors, as well as difficulty initiating movement, such as getting up from a chair, and slowness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients with the virus in their brain tissue also had a greater build-up of toxic tau protein and abnormal levels of key brain proteins, indicating very advanced disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tau is a protein that typically helps stabilize microtubules, the internal scaffolding of brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it becomes damaged and misfolded, it is a general sign that the brain cell is failing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dopamine levels in the brain from normal levels to Parkinson’s affected levels (left to right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finding more tau pathology in these patients is a strong indicator that the virus is associated with more widespread brain cell damage and dysfunction, not just the specific dopamine cell loss typical of pure Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://devel-insight.jci.org/articles/view/189988"&gt;JCI Insight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment options for Parkinson’s are limited in what they accomplish. They mainly provide symptomatic relief by managing motor symptoms, but they cannot cure or slow the progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Levodopa (L-Dopa) is the gold standard and most effective treatment. The brain converts L-Dopa into dopamine, which directly replaces the missing chemical that is causing the core movement symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 10 million people worldwide, including about 1million Americans, are estimated to have Parkinson’s disease, and that number is to grow to more than 25 million by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Koralnik said: ‘We plan to look more closely at how genes like LRRK2 affect the body’s response to other viral infections to figure out if this is a special effect of HPgV or a broader response to viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘One big question we still need to answer is how often the virus gets into the brains of people with or without Parkinson’s. We also aim to understand how viruses and genes interact; insights that could reveal how Parkinson’s begins and could help guide future therapies.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That’s mostly because the state is home to so many people from countries where the disease is consistently present. But it’s also because the parasite and vector live here, meaning some of those cases could be homegrown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s more from experts on the insidious disease and why it’s no longer considered a threat only abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;people get Chagas disease&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease is caused by the parasite &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi,&lt;/i&gt; which lives in a bloodsucking insect called the kissing bug. Susanne reports there are roughly a dozen species of kissing bugs in the U.S. and four in California known to carry the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that in some places, such as Los Angeles’ Griffith Park, about a third of all kissing bugs harbor the Chagas disease parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a disease that has been neglected and has been impacting Latin Americans for many decades,” said Norman Beatty, a medical epidemiologist at the University of Florida and an expert on Chagas disease. “But it’s also here in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had a kid from the Hollywood Hills who got it,” said Salvador Hernandez, a cardiologist with Kaiser Permanente in Northern California. He told Susanne that the patient had not traveled out of the country and probably got it in his leafy, affluent neighborhood, where kissing bugs are prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite has also been detected in local wildlife, including wood rats, skunks and mice in &lt;a class="link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7906329/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Griffith Park&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in bats, raccoons and black bears in other parts of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chagas disease’s symptoms and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;treatment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteins in the kissing bugs’ saliva can cause swollen limbs and eyes along with anaphylaxis. But it’s the longer-term or chronic effects that cause the most harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Chagas disease symptoms are often indistinguishable from other forms of cardiac and organ damage, it’s likely that many people are showing up to their doctors’ offices with heart arrhythmia, a swollen esophagus, seizures and stroke, without ever being screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although antiparasitic medications can be used to stop the illness’ progression, health experts say screenings for Chagas disease could help cure patients sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The disease is definitely underdiagnosed,” said Hernandez, the Kaiser cardiologist. “If we screened for it and caught it early, most patients could be cured. The problem is we don’t, and people end up dying or requiring terrifically expensive care,” including organ transplants and surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Chagas disease should be labeled endemic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of epidemiologists, researchers and medical doctors are calling on the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a class="link" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;to label the disease as endemic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. They hope that will bring awareness, education, dialogue and potentially public health investment to a disease that has long carried a stigma, falsely associated with poor, rural migrants from bug-infected homes in far-off tropical nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it’s not endemic in the U.S. yet, it is a reportable disease — which means physicians and health systems are required to report and investigate it — in Los Angeles and San Diego counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Hamer, an entomologist at Texas A&amp;amp;M University, said that confirmed human cases in the U.S. represent “just the tip of the iceberg” and that nobody really knows how many people actually have the disease. “There’s no standardized reporting system. There’s no active surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people find out they have the disease only after trying to donate blood, Hamer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full story &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-09-01/chagas-disease-the-deadly-disease-youve-never-heard-of-but-is-here"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="todays-top-stories" class="subhead"&gt;Today’s top stories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

Please sign in or subscribe to access the full content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Described as a successful high-school student, the youngster exhibits a condition known as &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/highly-superior-autobiographical-memory-are-there-really-people-who-never-forget-77569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;hyperthymesia&lt;/a&gt;, which refers to a significantly above-average autobiographical memory. This differs from &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/is-photographic-memory-a-real-thing-77301" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;superior memory&lt;/a&gt; in general as it relates specifically to the retrieval of past life events rather than the capacity to learn and store new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Identified only as TL, the remarkable individual claims to have kept her abilities secret for most of her life after being accused of lying when claiming she could revisit her past at the age of eight. Describing her talent for recollection, TL told the researchers that she visualized her personal memories inside a large, white room, where they were filed and organized into categories such as vacations, family life, and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Cuddly toys were neatly labeled with information regarding whom they were received from, while photographs and documents were stored in a file inside her memory room, from which they could be retrieved and examined in extraordinary detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“She could reexperience actual episodes vividly and inspect them in full detail, either from the perspective she actually occupied, or from an external viewpoint,” write the authors. “I can mentally travel back in time to relive the event,” she told them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Putting this claim to the test, the researchers administered a series of tasks designed to analyze the strength of her biographical &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/what-is-an-eidetic-memory-and-can-i-get-one-63407" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;memories&lt;/a&gt; – and her ability to visualize the future. And while these tasks can’t assess the accuracy of her recollection, they did reveal that her recall was unusually vivid and detailed, and had all the hallmarks of genuinely remembering events from her early childhood rather than just knowing that certain things happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Regarding TL’s ability to foresee personal events in the future, the researchers explain that her mental projections were exceptionally realistic and demonstrated “a deep sense of pre-experience”, as if they were being remembered rather than invented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This is the first observation of hyperthymesia with a full evaluation of &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/lsd-could-help-fight-depression-inhibiting-mental-time-travel-34674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;mental time travel&lt;/a&gt; capacities in different temporal distances, encompassing the individual capacity to retrieve personal events from the personal past as well as to foresee personal events in the future,” write the study authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And while the mechanisms behind this unique ability remain unknown, the researchers point out that several of TL’s family members exhibit rare cognitive traits such as &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/first-recorded-congenitally-blind-person-with-synesthesia-feels-times-as-textures-63385" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;synesthesia&lt;/a&gt; and perfect pitch, all of which could somehow be related to her remarkable autobiographical memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13554794.2025.2537950#abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Neurocase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 13:22:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxQVHhlMGdWVnJkR05UQ0xad3NQc09meW12a1RQbGxtRUdTa1RzdlgzZVFQaGNCbjFZS0ZibzlyUGxXcGkyMjA5QTFFUHlwMlBOdlhMSHg4T21XMWxmX3V2ejdEQmFiV1BxRFdOS1JueG5sVzNKcm1KZ0xzTFljQTV0XzA1N3FXaUZqdGtTZzZ0MV9xLXRJSThVUW9LMWR4VHNlLXpyVWZvR3ZmU3l5NnN0MFJTemVlcDY5NkJsX1lvTUZFNkpI</guid></item><item><title>这些科学家在他们的基因中发现了阿尔茨海默氏症。以下是他们接下来采取的措施：拍摄照片-健康新闻-美国国家公共广播电台</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/02/nx-s1-5522371/alzheimers-risk-apoe4-genes-scientists-treatment-advocacy</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Three scientists learned they carry genes that significantly increase their risk for Alzheimer's. Here's how they're grapping with the news, and working to keep their brains healthy.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;People who inherit two copies of a gene variant called APOE4 have a 60% chance of developing Alzheimer's by age 85.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Only about 2% to 3% of people in the U.S. have this genetic profile, and most of them don't know it because they've never sought genetic testing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But three scientists are among those who did get tested, and learned that they are in the high-risk group. Now, each is making an effort to protect not only their own brain, but the brains of others with the genotype known as APOE4-4.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;June: from dismay to hope&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A genetic test from 23andMe gave June the bad news in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I just felt like the end of the world," says June, who asked to use only her first name out of fear that making her genetic status public could affect her job or health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;June was 57 when she found out. As someone with a doctorate in biochemistry, she quickly understood what the results meant.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"People with our genotype are almost destined to get the disease," she says. "We tend to get symptoms 7 to 10 years earlier than the general population, which means that I had about seven years left before I may get the disease."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first, June spent sleepless nights online, reading academic papers about Alzheimer's and genetics. She even looked into physician-assisted suicide in an effort to make sure she would not become a burden to her adult son.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then she discovered online communities like &lt;a href="http://apoe4.info" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ApoE4.info&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which included people with her genetic profile.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I not only found useful information, I forged deep friendships with people," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;June learned about the brain benefits of a Mediterranean diet, exercise, sleep, and stress reduction. And while perusing the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alzheimer's Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; website, she discovered an intriguing research project at the University of California, San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's an ongoing &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT06124339" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to see whether four months of vigorous mental and physical exercise can improve brain health in people ages 50 to 85.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So in 2024, June found herself on a stationary bicycle at UCSD playing a strenuous virtual reality game.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"You're riding a bike and you go through unfamiliar terrain where you need to make turns," she says. "So you really have to use all your cognitive reserve."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study also involved a series of MRI scans and cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That was absolutely a game changer because I not only got to watch my brain in action, I was able to develop really effective strategies of retaining my memory," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Since participating in that trial, June has been advocating for federal funding for Alzheimer's research and urging the Food and Drug Administration to consider drugs that might benefit people who have the APOE4-4 genotype.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I realize that being APOE4-4 is not the end of the world," June says. "There's so many things we can do."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;David Watson: drug discovery&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lots of mental and physical activity might delay the symptoms of Alzheimer's, says &lt;a href="https://www.researchalz.com/alzheimers-treatment-center-staff/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;David Watson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neuropsychologist and CEO of the Alzheimer's Research and Treatment Center in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But that's not enough for him and other people who carry two copies of APOE4 variant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Any of these things that we can do preventively, they're going to be helpful," Watson says. "But are they going to override genetics? No, they're not, unfortunately."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Watson, now in his mid 50s, learned his genetic status about 25 years ago after seeing several family members develop Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He decided to devote his career to running clinical trials of Alzheimer's drugs in hopes of finding one that might protect his brain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That effort helped get two new drugs (&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5300930/did-an-alzheimers-drug-give-sue-and-ken-bell-more-time-maybe" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lecanemab&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5309499/alzheimers-was-taking-her-memory-so-she-started-taking-a-new-drug" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;donanemab&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) on the market. Unfortunately, Watson is not a good candidate for either drug.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lecanemab and donanemab are both monoclonal antibodies that remove sticky amyloid plaques from the brain — a hallmark of Alzheimer's. But in people with Watson's genetic profile, the drugs often cause dangerous swelling or bleeding in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If someone is APOE-4-4, they should probably should not go on a monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid," he says. Or if they do, it should be "very cautiously with additional counseling," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So Watson has been focusing on an &lt;a href="https://alzheon.com/pipeline/alz-801-development/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;experimental drug&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that's meant specifically for people with two copies of APOE4. The pill, which was tested in some patients at his center, is designed to interrupt the process that leads to amyloid plaques, rather than removing plaques that have already formed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This particular compound actually showed remarkable findings," Watson says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The drug, made by Alzheon, didn't cause brain swelling or bleeding. And it prevented brain areas associated with memory from shrinking the way they usually do in Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But in a &lt;a href="https://alzheon.com/topline-results-from-pivotal-apolloe4-phase-3-trial-of-oral-valiltramiprosate-alz-801-in-patients-with-early-alzheimers-disease-carrying-two-copies-of-apoe4-gene/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;large trial&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the drug failed to clearly show it could slow down cognitive decline in people who already had Alzheimer's symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even so, Watson thinks the Alzheon drug has potential.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some study participants who've stayed on the drug seem to be "holding their own" instead of getting worse, Watson says. And blood tests of these participants suggest that "we're really making a difference in keeping neurons alive," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Wendy Nelson: Going very public&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When a genetic test from 23andMe showed that Wendy Nelson carried two copies of the APOE4 variant, she went quiet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I just sort of didn't want to tell anybody at first," she says. "I really just kept the results to myself."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nelson, 54, is a PhD scientist in the biotech industry. So she knew what the results meant. But she didn't know what to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She was already taking part in the sort of activities that might protect her brain. "I'm a triathlete, a hardcore hiker, I eat healthy," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So when she learned her status in 2022, about the only changes she could make were to stop drinking and start a cholesterol drug.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then, one of Nelson's biotech contacts put her in touch with a &lt;a href="https://beingpatient.com/event/biotech-and-business-development-leader-wendy-nelson-on-living-with-the-apoe4-gene/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;podcast&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about dementia and brain health. They asked her to do an interview. She agreed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That was at the point where no one knew what my status was," she says."But in my mind, I was thinking, well, who's ever going to see this?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lots of people, it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pretty soon, Nelson found herself on other podcasts, being interviewed by Reuters, and eventually appearing on TV news. She began working with advocacy groups including the &lt;a href="https://apoe4alzheimersalliance.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;APOE4-4 Alzheimer's Alliance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nelson says being a public face for the APOE4-4 community gives her a chance to educate the public about a genetic profile that affects about 800,000 people in the U.S. It also gives her a forum to advocate for more basic research on Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And just a few weeks ago, Nelson got a chance to meet with officials of the Food and Drug Administration to talk about Alzheimer's drugs for people like her.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I provided my seven minutes of testimony to the to the FDA, which was my plea for more options," she says, "because I don't feel like I have anything out there right now."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But Nelson, like June and Watson, says people in the APOE4-4 community can change that by pushing for more research and an easier regulatory path for drugs that might help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A campaign is calling on Tishrei guests from Israel to get health and travel insurance. &lt;a class="read-more-main-single read-more-main" href="https://collive.com/tishrei-guests-encouraged-to-get-health-and-travel-insurance/"&gt;Full Story&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                        

                 &lt;div class="post_text"&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By COLlive reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As thousands of Lubavitchers prepare to travel to New York for the month of Tishrei, Chabad’s Emergency and Security Center (CWA) has launched a new campaign urging guests to arrange proper health and travel insurance ahead of their trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initiative, titled “May We Have a Safe New Year”, aims to highlight the importance of taking practical precautions alongside spiritual preparations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using familiar imagery such as a gartel, the campaign is designed to resonate with Chassidim and reinforce the message that early organization can make a crucial difference in moments of need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For years we have been working to safeguard shluchim around the world,” the CWA said in a statement. “This is not a luxury. It is a basic necessity. Together with arranging flights, lodging, and learning schedules, one must ensure valid medical insurance for the entire duration of the stay abroad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reminder comes in light of several unfortunate medical emergencies in recent years that led to urgent crowdfunding campaigns that asked hosting families in Crown Heights, as well as Lubavitchers worldwide for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizers say that with proper insurance coverage, families can avoid financial strain while ensuring professional treatment in case of unexpected medical situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is part of the Torah commandment Venishmartem me’od lenafshoseichem—to take care of your health,” the campaign emphasizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Snacks with protein and fiber help prevent blood sugar and energy dips between meals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limiting added sugar supports stable blood sugars in people with diabetes mellitus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose snacks with 2 or more food groups that are a combination of protein and fiber, like fruit with nuts or veggies with hummus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Snacks are a valuable way to keep blood sugars and energy levels steady, whether you have diabetes mellitus, prediabetes or are simply being proactive about balancing blood sugars. These between-meal bites can help prevent blood sugar (and energy) crashes during the day. It’s no surprise, however, that certain snacks affect blood sugars differently.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s where the conversation about added sugar comes in. Sweet snacks are one of the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7899305/top-sources-of-added-sugar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;top sources of added sugars in the U.S. diet&lt;/a&gt;, and too much of the sweet stuff can contribute to weight gain, type 2 diabetes and heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “It’s beneficial to minimize added sugar intake by choosing snacks with little to no added sugars. This simple habit can make a big difference in maintaining stable blood sugar levels,” says &lt;a href="https://www.esthertambenutrition.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Esther Tambe, M.S., RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, a certified diabetes care and education specialist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We spoke with registered dietitians who shared their top tips for selecting a snack for healthy blood sugars, along with the best &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-no-sugar-added-snacks-at-trader-joes-8713445" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;no-added-sugar snacks&lt;/a&gt; for better blood sugar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-choose-a-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Choose a Snack &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides minimizing added sugars, experts recommend ensuring your snack has more than just carbs. “I always recommend choosing a snack that includes at least two different food groups. This will make the snack more enticing by adding multiple colors and/or textures and adding a variety of different nutrients,” says &lt;a href="https://www.staceywoodson.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stacey Woodson, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For better blood sugar, it’s especially important to include protein and fiber. And if you eat the protein-rich food first, you’ll benefit from a slower release of blood sugar in the bloodstream, says &lt;a href="https://www.samanthadevitonutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samantha DeVito, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/make-ahead-high-protein-snacks-11680376" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protein-rich snack foods&lt;/a&gt; include nuts, Greek yogurt, seeds and cheese.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is another important nutrient for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833638/foods-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;balancing blood sugars&lt;/a&gt;. “Fiber acts like a garbage collector, if glucose is litter. When our meal contains fiber, it sticks to glucose, which causes a slower release of sugar into the bloodstream,” says DeVito. You can add fiber through foods like fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds and whole grains. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are seven no-added-sugar snack ideas dietitians recommend for stable blood sugars.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-strained-greek-style-yogurt-with-nuts-and-berries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Strained (Greek-Style) Yogurt with Nuts and Berries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252837/nut-berry-parfait/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Strained (Greek-style) yogurt with nuts and berries&lt;/a&gt; is a well-rounded snack for blood sugars. “Most [strained (Greek-style)] yogurts are high in protein and contain [little to] no added sugars, while nuts provide healthy fats and fiber, which are excellent for blood sugar balance,” says Tambe. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Top this snack off with berries for added fiber and even more blood sugar benefits, recommends &lt;a href="https://www.kristenlorenznutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kristen Lorenz, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. The fiber from the berries also reduces a rise in blood sugar after eating.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Note that flavored strained (Greek-style) yogurt can be a source of added sugar, so we recommend selecting plain Greek yogurt or a brand the specifies no added sugars. “I like Two Good &amp;amp; Co. yogurts and smoothies for their high protein content and low sugar,” says Tambe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-veggies-with-hummus"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Veggies with Hummus &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the savory food lovers out there, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291318/is-hummus-a-healthy-food/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;hummus&lt;/a&gt; and veggies is another great snack option. Lorenz recommends this combo since it has a good balance of carbs, fiber and protein. In fact, the American Diabetes Association considers legumes (like the chickpeas &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252614/classic-hummus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;used to make hummus&lt;/a&gt;) to be plant-based protein superstars because they offer fiber, protein and a range of minerals like potassium and zinc.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Veggies like peppers, cucumbers and carrots are low in carbs and great for dipping.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-apple-with-peanut-butter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Apple with Peanut Butter &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although you may have heard you should avoid fruit because of its sugar content, fruit contains fiber and beneficial plant compounds that support overall health. It's an important food group for everyone, especially if you’re focused on preventing diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To mitigate fruit’s impact on blood sugars, pair fruit with a source of protein and/or fat, like an apple with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-peanut-butter-good-for-you-8638482" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;peanut butter&lt;/a&gt; or other nut butter. “Pectin (the fiber from the apple) paired with the fat and protein from peanut butter will help keep you full while also helping keep your blood sugars in check,” says Lorenz.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some peanut butter has added sugars, so check the ingredients list to ensure yours is added-sugar-free. Ones without added sugars are often marketed as “natural,” but scan the ingredients. Ideally, the only ingredient is peanuts or nuts with salt. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-hard-boiled-egg-with-grapes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Hard-Boiled Egg with Grapes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another fruit-forward snack DeVito recommends for better blood sugars is grapes with a hard-boiled egg. The grapes give you a burst of sweetness and a bit of fiber, and the hard-boiled egg provides protein to help lessen blood sugar spikes. If you’re not a hard-boiled egg fan, you can swap the egg for string cheese. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-homemade-energy-balls"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Homemade Energy Balls &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Energy balls—made with nuts, dried fruit and spices or other flavorings—are another great option for blood sugars, and they’re easy to make without added sugars. “I love to blend dates, unsweetened cocoa powder and nuts and then roll them into balls. They're the perfect snack because they are sweet and chocolaty but filled with fiber and protein, which helps you feel full longer and keeps your blood sugar stable,” says Woodson.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avocados are another great food for diabetes. In fact, research has linked &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026117/avocados-benefits/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;higher avocado intake&lt;/a&gt; with better blood sugars, especially for people with diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For a satisfying avocado snack, prepare chocolate avocado pudding. Try our recipe for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251076/chocomole-pudding/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;"Chocomole" Pudding&lt;/a&gt;, or follow Woodson’s advice: Blend together ripe avocado, banana and cocoa powder. “I love to top it with some pumpkin seeds to amp up the fiber content and add a little protein to help maintain healthy blood sugars,” says Woodson. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-chia-pudding"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7. Chia Pudding &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chia pudding&lt;/a&gt; is often enjoyed for breakfast, but it also makes for a great snack. Simply soak chia seeds in the unsweetened milk of your choice for a few hours and you have a delightful pudding. You can top it with fruit, nuts and spices like cinnamon for added flavor and nutrition.
&lt;/p&gt;

The research focused on how synthetic hormones may alter activity in areas of the brain linked to decision-making and emotional processing. Musk’s post amplified the study’s findings to a global audience, drawing widespread attention to the broader question of whether the long-term side effects of commonly used medications are fully understood or sufficiently communicated to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Elon Musk’s warning on birth control pills and the study behind it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musk’s post was linked to a Rice University study published in Hormones and Behavior (2025). Researchers found that hormonal contraceptives may alter activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a brain region tied to emotion regulation, decision-making, and memory. Adolescent girls on contraceptives showed stronger emotional responses but recalled fewer details of negative experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Beatriz Brandao, revealed that women on birth control processed emotions differently when using strategies such as distancing or reinterpretation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this pattern may protect against reliving distress, it could also alter memory patterns in unexpected ways. Co-authors Bryan Denny and Stephanie Leal highlighted that reproductive hormones shape fundamental mental health processes, including stress response and resilience, and called for more research into different contraceptive types and menstrual phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;How contraceptives may shape emotions and memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rice team found that women on contraceptives tended to enhance memory for positive experiences when fully immersing themselves in them, suggesting that hormonal influences may support resilience-building. At the same time, differences in handling negative experiences raised questions about long-term behavioral effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier research supports this concern. A 2018 Frontiers in Psychology study showed that damage to the vmPFC reduces empathy, while a 2013 Psychoneuroendocrinology paper suggested that contraceptive use can influence mate preferences. More recent studies, including a 2023 paper in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity, linked synthetic hormones to heightened stress and inflammation, underscoring the need for deeper investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From individual health to population-wide effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than 60 million women in the United States and hundreds of millions globally using hormonal birth control, even small cognitive or emotional shifts could scale into population-wide effects. Some researchers argue that these influences may extend to stress responses, social decision-making, and even political attitudes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, most medical experts caution against alarmism. They emphasize that contraceptives bring significant health benefits, including preventing unintended pregnancies, regulating menstrual cycles, and reducing risks of ovarian and endometrial cancers. For the majority of women, these benefits outweigh the potential risks. What is needed, they argue, is not panic, but better research, clearer communication, and more personalized options for reproductive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Musk’s post drew global attention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musk’s brief “read the box” post was not a direct attack on contraceptives but a reminder to be informed about any medication. Its timing, however, against the backdrop of new research, pushed the conversation into the spotlight. Supporters saw his words as a call for greater transparency in pharmaceutical science, while critics warned that influential voices risk fueling misconceptions about birth control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate highlights a broader challenge: how to balance recognition of contraceptive side effects with the immense social and medical value these drugs provide. Musk’s comment, simple as it was, amplified a conversation that blends science, health, and ethics, one likely to continue as more research emerges. As studies advance, experts stress the importance of communicating nuanced findings without creating unnecessary fear. The growing debate underscores the need for informed choices, where both risks and benefits are clearly presented to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 12:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>古代呼吸练习缓解睡眠呼吸暂停，研究发现- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/ancient-breathing-practice-eases-sleep-113100831.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A study shows an ancient breathing practice may ease sleep apnea symptoms, offering a simple, low-cost alternative to machines. (CREDIT: Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A centuries-old tradition may soon find a place in modern medicine. Researchers have discovered that a simple &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/5-minute-daily-breathing-workout-115100996.html" data-ylk="slk:breathing exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;breathing exercise&lt;/a&gt; involving a conch shell can ease symptoms of a common sleep disorder. For people who struggle with restless nights, loud snoring, and daytime fatigue, this surprising approach may offer real relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obstructive &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/people-sleep-apnea-higher-risk-140700473.html" data-ylk="slk:sleep apnea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; affects millions worldwide. It occurs when the airway narrows or collapses during sleep, interrupting breathing and reducing oxygen levels. The result is poor sleep quality, increased risk of high blood pressure, heart problems, and even stroke. Standard treatment relies on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines, which keep airways open through a facemask. CPAP works well but is often uncomfortable, leading many patients to abandon it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a group of scientists in India has turned to tradition for answers. Their findings suggest that blowing a conch shell—a practice rooted in cultural and spiritual rituals—could provide measurable benefits for people with moderate forms of this condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Picture of a conch shell and researcher demonstrating practice of shankh blowing. (CREDIT: Krishna K Sharma)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Testing a Traditional Technique&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial, led by Dr. Krishna K. Sharma from the &lt;a href="https://www.eternalhospital.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; in Jaipur, set out to test whether conch blowing could strengthen airway muscles. The study followed 30 adults with moderate sleep apnea between 2022 and 2024. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volunteers were split into two groups. One group practiced blowing into a conch shell, while the other performed structured deep breathing exercises. Both groups were trained at the clinic and then practiced at home for at least 15 minutes, five days a week, over six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant underwent overnight sleep studies known as polysomnography. These tests measured breathing interruptions, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/1162023-mouth-taping-found-to-improve-quality-of-sleep-and-blood-oxygen-levels/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:oxygen levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;oxygen levels&lt;/a&gt;, and other markers of sleep quality. They were also surveyed on how well they slept and how tired they felt during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. People who practiced the conch technique had four to five fewer breathing pauses each hour compared to the deep breathing group. They also reported a 34% drop in daytime sleepiness and showed higher oxygen levels at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Conch Blowing Works&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conch shell, or shankh, is blown with a forceful and controlled breath. The technique requires a deep inhalation followed by a long exhalation through tight lips. This produces strong vibrations and creates airflow resistance. According to Dr. Sharma, this unique pattern may &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/new-drug-boosts-fat-burning-and-increases-muscle-endurance-without-a-workout/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:strengthen muscles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;strengthen muscles&lt;/a&gt; in the throat and soft palate, areas prone to collapse in sleep apnea. The spiral shape of the shell could also enhance the acoustic and mechanical effects, stimulating muscles further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way the shankh is blown is quite distinctive,” he explained. “It creates vibrations and resistance that strengthen airway muscles, which helps prevent collapse during sleep.” This natural exercise may offer a non-invasive and affordable alternative for people unable to tolerate CPAP machines. Unlike devices or drugs, it relies only on disciplined practice and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A small randomized controlled trial suggests that regularly blowing a conch shell, an ancient yogic breathing practice known as shankh blowing, may ease symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea. (CREDIT: Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking Beyond Machines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, CPAP has been the gold standard for treating sleep apnea. Yet studies show that many patients stop using it within the first year because of discomfort. Alternatives like oral appliances or surgery exist but can be expensive and carry risks. Shankh blowing stands out as a low-cost, low-risk practice. “For people living with sleep apnea, especially those who find CPAP uncomfortable, unaffordable, or inaccessible, our findings offer a promising alternative,” said Dr. Sharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues plan to expand their work into larger trials across multiple hospitals. These future studies will test whether the benefits hold in more severe cases and across different populations. Researchers also want to measure long-term changes in airway muscle tone, oxygen levels, and overall sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Global Perspectives on New Therapies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts outside the study are cautiously optimistic. Professor Sophia Schiza, head of the European Respiratory Society’s group on sleep disordered breathing at the &lt;a href="https://www.uoc.gr/en/home/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of Crete;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;University of Crete&lt;/a&gt;, praised the approach. She noted that patients often seek new options beyond machines. “This is an intriguing study that shows the ancient practice of shankh blowing could potentially offer a treatment by targeting muscle training,” she said. “A larger study will help provide more evidence for this intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Conch shell blowing is a traditional yogic breathing exercise that generates sustained exhalation and vibrations, which may strengthen upper airway muscles and improve respiratory function. (CREDIT: CC BY 3.0 US)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;She emphasized that sleep apnea remains a global health concern. Beyond sleepiness and snoring, it can shorten lives through its links to cardiovascular disease. Adding new tools to the treatment arsenal could improve patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Science of Ancient Practices&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of blending traditional practices with modern medicine is gaining momentum. Breathing techniques from yoga and meditation are being studied for their effects on stress, lung health, and even immunity. Conch blowing adds another layer, combining &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-drug-delivers-the-same-health-benefits-as-physical-exercise-study-finds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:physical exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;physical exercise&lt;/a&gt; with acoustic and mechanical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers believe this could serve as a model for other non-invasive therapies that strengthen the body naturally. The challenge will be proving effectiveness through large, controlled trials and ensuring safe, standardized training methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What It Means for Patients&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the findings remain preliminary. With only 30 participants, the study was small. Still, the improvements were clear enough to inspire further research. For patients tired of restless nights and bulky machines, the idea of using a conch shell as therapy may sound unusual—but it may also be worth a try under medical guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sharma hopes that more people will see value in ancient practices that can be tested with scientific methods. “This is a small study, but we are now planning a larger trial,” he said. “We’re particularly interested in comparing shankh blowing with standard treatments like CPAP, and in examining its potential help in more severe forms of sleep apnea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early evidence suggests that a practice rooted in tradition may one day complement, or even reduce reliance on, modern machines. For millions living with interrupted sleep and daytime exhaustion, that possibility could change lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research findings are available online in the journal &lt;a href="https://publications.ersnet.org/content/erjor/early/2025/06/05/2312054100258-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ERJ Open Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ERJ Open Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: The article above provided above by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Brighter Side of News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Brighter Side of News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like these kind of feel good stories?

			&lt;p&gt;A common way to manage coronary heart disease is coming under question. To prevent a repeat heart attack or stroke, many patients of a certain age are currently advised to take &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/daily-aspirin-therapy/art-20046797"&gt;low-dose aspirin&lt;/a&gt; each day, indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence suggests a better option already exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="172680" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; by an international team of cardiologists finds that &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/clopidogrel-oral-route/description/drg-20063146"&gt;clopidogrel&lt;/a&gt; – which stops blood platelets from clumping – is a superior choice to aspirin in the long run for patients with established coronary artery disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oral drug works among various age groups, ethnicities, sexes, and body sizes, and it's highly effective at 'thinning' the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-shocking-number-still-dont-know-the-risk-of-taking-aspirin-each-day"&gt;A Shocking Number Still Don't Know The Risk of Taking Aspirin Each Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to aspirin, clopidogrel lowers the risk of a future heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death by roughly 14 percent, and importantly, it does so without increasing the risk of excessive bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug was only tested as a secondary treatment, which means it prevents major cardiovascular events in those who have already suffered a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings support the consideration of clopidogrel as the preferred long-term anti-platelet strategy instead of aspirin in patients with established coronary artery disease," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01562-4"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;, led by Ki Hong Choi of Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea and Marco Valgimigli of the Cardiocentro Ticino Institute in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172708" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172708" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AspirinLowDose-642x233.png" alt="Aspirin Vs Clopidogrel" class="size-medium wp-image-172708" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AspirinLowDose-642x233.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AspirinLowDose-1024x371.png 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AspirinLowDose-768x278.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AspirinLowDose-600x217.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AspirinLowDose.png 1330w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172708" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Effectiveness of aspirin and clopidogrel in preventing major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events.

Patients who are concerned about their current courses of treatment are encouraged to discuss their options with medical specialists before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be time to reassess the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-shocking-number-still-dont-know-the-risk-of-taking-aspirin-each-day?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;risks&lt;/a&gt; and benefits of low-dose aspirin, &lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2022/04/27/20/41/new-uspstf-recommendation-on-aspirin-in-cvd"&gt;especially among older folk at higher risk of bleeds&lt;/a&gt;. C&lt;span&gt;lopidogrel is waiting in the wings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01562-4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lancet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Studies show that leaving plastic water bottles in hot environments, like a car, causes them to release billions of microplastic particles and harmful chemicals into the water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heat and UV exposure accelerate the breakdown of plastics, while bottles stored in cool, dark places shed little to no microplastics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To reduce exposure, experts recommend avoiding long-term storage of bottled water in hot conditions and opting for reusable glass or metal bottles instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Worried about your exposure to microplastics? Then you'd better think twice before drinking that water that's been sitting in your car for days.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Microplastic research has gone into overdrive in recent years as more people recognize how much they ingest and its potential health risks. Studies show it could cause everything from &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/microplastics-liver-damage-study-11760317" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;liver damage&lt;/a&gt; to inflammation and &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/boiling-water-removes-microplastics-study-11796372" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;. And none of that is good. The problem is that avoiding microplastics feels like a game of whack-a-mole: as soon as we find and eliminate one source from our routine, another pops up. However, there's a new source that seems fairly easy to avoid: that old, hot plastic water bottle sitting in your cup holder for who knows how long. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In 2023, researchers examined how &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666911023000047#sec0035" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;different temperatures and UV exposure &lt;/a&gt;affect four common plastics, the same types used in packaging and bottles that could easily be left in a hot car. They discovered that although each type of plastic degraded slightly differently, all of them released tiny microplastic fragments, and not just a few. During testing, the plastics released billions of microscopic particles into the water. In contrast, the bottles kept in a refrigerated environment as the control group released almost none. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And this was far from a one-off conclusion. In 2014, researchers from the &lt;a href="https://blogs.ifas.ufl.edu/news/2014/09/22/dont-drink-the-warm-water-ufifas-study-says/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;University of Florida&lt;/a&gt; reached similar results with their study, which examined how chemicals were released from 16 brands of bottled water stored at 158°F for four weeks. They described their findings as a “worst-case scenario” for human consumption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--youtube"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you store the water long enough, there may be a concern,” soil and water science professor Lena Ma, and lead researcher on the study, noted at the time. The team noted that they would advise people against leaving bottled water in a "hot garage for weeks on end or in your car all day during the summer." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Generally, heat and plastics don't mix well. As Food &amp;amp; Wine previously &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/hot-drinks-microplastic-contamination-11797948" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, a 2025 study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science of the Total Environment&lt;/em&gt; examined the varying levels of microplastics found in 31 popular drinks in the United Kingdom. The study found that hot beverages are the primary source of microplastic exposure, with hot tea containing about 60 microplastic particles per liter and hot coffee around 43. However, iced versions of these drinks had significantly fewer microplastics, with iced tea carrying 31 particles per liter and iced coffee 37. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This doesn't mean you need to go thirsty if that day-old water bottle is your only option. As Jaime Ross, an assistant professor of neuroscience at the University of Rhode Island, shared with the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/08/19/plastic-water-bottles-microplastics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it's more about avoiding repeated exposure, because not only could you be ingesting microplastics, but heat "could contribute to the growth of pathogens." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As for what can be done, the researchers of the 2022 study noted that "Product labels, incl. bottled waters, should contain information regarding the composition of its packaging and inform about the possibility of releasing bisphenol A into water." However, if you don't want to wait for companies to act, you can do so yourself by storing your water in cool, dark places or switching to reusable glass and metal bottles whenever possible. Then, follow this &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/how-to-reduce-microplastics-in-the-kitchen-11760233" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;advice to reduce your exposure to microplastics at home&lt;/a&gt;, so you can stop playing microplastic wack-a-mole, too. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Food &amp; Wine</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 12:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxPWEpLY1lESTBjX3RLekdETzM4NzRodWZiTHpjMklzc09xZlRvWGlWNTR2ZXlUaWRtYjlfQ29uNEdCN3F0eHNzQ3dWSlBPRzBCODRJWEhkXzJobFdIVzNqaHJXbXh1aGFqbUdtVEpYak1lMEpWNnR6aDVyQmFlWDlvSG9xNTZ0Zw</guid></item><item><title>八秒就要掉下去了？如何充分利用短时间的注意力-对话</title><link>https://theconversation.com/eight-seconds-and-dropping-how-to-make-the-most-of-short-attention-spans-263461</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are regularly bombarded with information about a steep drop in attention spans. Based on its own data in 2015, &lt;a href="https://sherpapg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MAS.pdf"&gt;Microsoft reported&lt;/a&gt; that the average attention span had dropped from about 12 seconds for millennials to eight seconds for gen Z. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as the new Premier League season kicked off, UEFA introduced &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ckgd64g05v4o#:%7E:text=What%20is%20the%20eight%2Dsecond%20rule%3F&amp;amp;text=One%20of%20the%20biggest%20changes,clamp%20down%20on%20time%2Dwasting."&gt;a new “eight seconds rule”&lt;/a&gt; stating a goalkeeper cannot hold the ball for more than eight seconds or the opposing team wins a corner kick. Coincidence? The rule was introduced to avoid time wasting. It may be that the mean length of attention needed to kick the ball is on average eight seconds. And perhaps this is also how long viewers can pay attention when nothing’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how does attention really work? How can we improve it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attention is crucial. Who hasn’t experienced getting distracted in the middle of a conversation and suddenly forgot what they were saying. However, what is sometimes missed is that there are many forms of attention, and not all of them are necessarily diminishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The football rule is more closely related to a type of attention called visual scanning. For a goalkeeper, this can be scanning the field to work out who to pass the ball to. There are many studies on visual scanning in football, though not so much on goalkeepers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One paper studied scanning and performance in English Premier League football players. They found using &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.553813/full"&gt;a ten-second scan time&lt;/a&gt; gave players a small but positive performance advantage.
Other studies have shown that within elite football players, the best players, &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02640414.2024.2421662#d1e194"&gt;spend more time scanning&lt;/a&gt; than others, unless there is an opponent player in close proximity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/686558/original/file-20250820-84-6nc9sk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Goalkeepers have to scan before they kick the ball.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/london-england-january-13-2019-david-1425456677"&gt;Cosmin Iftode/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scanning is a form of attention that allows the footballer to take advantage of a time-limited opportunity, where decisions of who to pass to or where to run to on the field &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/456168a"&gt;have to be made very rapidly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a type of “hot cognition” – a social and emotional way of thinking, a bit like a gut instinct. It is very different to the “cold” or “rational” cognition involved in the decision making that footballers do with their managers and coaches off the field, where videos of plays are analysed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such situations, we are more likely to use “sustained attention”, which is paying attention to something for a sustained period of time. This ultimately requires mental concentration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly there are other forms of attention, for example “divided attention” or “alternating attention” which involve shifting attention between different things over a sustained period of time. These are typically also used for more cold decisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different parts of the brain are at work when we use different kinds of attention. Hot decisions &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18390562/"&gt;involve a brain network&lt;/a&gt; that includes the ventromedial prefrontal or orbitofrontal cortex, which support emotional regulation and decision making. Cold decisions, on the other hand, involves a different neural network that includes &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11872618/"&gt;dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, supporting executive functions such as controlling or inhibitions or short-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another time we make hot, rapid decisions is with first impressions. Again, the attention used is a type of immediate gut instinct. Unsurprisingly therefore, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3267862/"&gt;is an important brain region&lt;/a&gt; associated with first impressions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we see or meet someone for the first time, we implicitly form an impression of their attractiveness and possibly other traits as well. We may adjust that initial immediate impression later, using more sustained or divided types of attention, as we learn more about the person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great example of this is given by Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet in Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, where negative first impressions form immediately. Only later are they corrected to positive impressions as more knowledge is gained about the two protagonists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positive first impressions &lt;a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/studying-first-impressions-what-to-consider"&gt;tend to stick with people&lt;/a&gt;. Also, if very positive first impressions are accurate, they have been shown to lead long-term relationships, which in some cases &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550612463735"&gt;may be the “love at first sight” effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Motivation improves attention&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this means there isn’t a single brain region involved in “attention” in general. It is possible to get better at one form of attention and worse at another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Gen Z has the highest daily screen time with many spending 2.5 hours per day on social media – which does require some sustained attention. The eight seconds is therefore more likely to be visual scanning or surfing for something interesting. Young people also spend long periods of time listening to podcasts and are increasingly &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamrowe1/2019/04/16/new-study-finds-2-reasons-why-audiobooks-appeal-to-the-younger-generation/"&gt;consuming audiobooks&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting they can focus for long periods of time, but may prefer outlets that allow them to multitask. So, if the content is interesting, motivation can improve sustained attention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been told several times by mothers of children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that they don’t understand why their kids cannot concentrate on their schoolwork when they can spend hours playing computer games. The answer is motivation. When enjoying yourself, time goes by quickly and it is easy to sustain your attention over a long period of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also suggests a solution to improving attention spans. We have to make tasks that require attention more motivating or fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sustained attention&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it isn’t just scanning attention that appears to be reducing. There have been a number of studies on how sustained attention is decreasing too. Some psychologists therefore argue that lectures to students &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/advan.00109.2016"&gt;should be shorter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a study of medical students found that information presented between 15 and 30 minutes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S014067367892233X"&gt;was recalled best&lt;/a&gt;, whereas material presented during the first 15 min had the worst retention. So it is possible to hack people’s attention and design lectures in a way that makes them remember the content better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, where the student sat in the lecture hall also had impact on retention. Tests were given immediately following the lecture to students sitting at the front, middle, and back of the lecture hall. They remembered 80%, 71.6%, and 68.1%, respectively. However, where you chose to sit could also reflect your natural motivation for the lecture topic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biophysics researcher Neil Bradbury &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/advan.00109.2016"&gt;makes a compelling case&lt;/a&gt; that students’ motivation and teacher enthusiasm and passion, combined with good quality content and illustrations, are key factors in determining how long a lecturer is able to hold the audience’s attention. Perhaps allowing students to shift attention between listening, viewing and writing could also be useful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting the content should not be all about cold decision making, you also need to consider hot cognition in putting yourself in the minds of the audience and considering what might interest them the most.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

The experience taught him that pain hijacks your entire identity, and it hijacks the identity of the whole family. Pain, he saw, can create a sense of powerlessness compounded by the medical community, which often struggles to understand and treat &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/the-big-number-502-million-people-live-with-chronic-pain-in-the-us/2021/06/03/94a9e94c-c493-11eb-8c18-fd53a628b992_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt;.

For instance, the U.K. shut down its last coal plant in September 2024. One Utah coal town is transitioning into a clean energy leader as it completes a hydrogen-capable power plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In an interview with &lt;a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/05082025/pittsburgh-asthma-cases-drop-after-coal-plant-closure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Inside Climate News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Inside Climate News&lt;/a&gt;, George Thurston, a professor at New York University's School of Medicine, noted that pollution caused by coke making is especially harmful, saying that it's like "coal-fired power plant particles, but on steroids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, he added that the health impacts of these plants are indicative of the broader health threat from dirty energy sources, which also include oil and natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"We're all exposed to [pollution from dirty energy] every single day," he told ICN. "We're bathed in it. All throughout our lives, day and night, every day of the week, we're exposed to this when we drive on roads, when we get on a train, when we go to the city.

COVID killed 1½%. Since I wrote this book, we have uncovered a new virus in China — from a bat in a cave, it wasn’t from a lab — that has the same high-efficiency transmission potential that COVID did. And it has the same genetic characteristics as a MERS or SARS that could kill 30% of the people infected. That’s floating out there right now. That, tomorrow, could be the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q:&lt;/b&gt; So preparedness, particularly in the area of vaccines, will be more crucial, even as your book notes the current government is skeptical of, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.startribune.com/few-minnesota-kids-get-covid-shots-but-federal-switch-could-make-access-harder-for-families/601363236" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.startribune.com/few-minnesota-kids-get-covid-shots-but-federal-switch-could-make-access-harder-for-families/601363236"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.

What we need to have happen is a general understanding of why we need to be better prepared. Do you think there will be better preparedness for a flooding of the Guadalupe River in the future? I think so. We need to have the mindset that it’s going to cost us to do this but it’s an incredible insurance policy for society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Big One: How We Must Prepare for Future Deadly Pandemics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box   article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;&lt;b&gt;By:&lt;/b&gt; Michael T.

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In August 2024, the news came in quick succession. On Tuesday — Aug. 13, 2024 — Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared mpox a public health emergency of continental concern. The very next day, the World Health Organization followed suit elevating the mpox outbreak to its highest threat level. We published a story with the headline: "&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/08/14/g-s1-16977/mpox-public-health-emergency-world-health-organization-who" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHO declares 2024 mpox surge a 'public health emergency of international concern.'&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today, those emergency declarations are still in effect but mpox has faded from the headlines. This story is a continuation of our annual series — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/series/547350271/following-up" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;"Whatever happened to …"&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — that follows up on previous reporting to see where things stand now. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="container large" id="cong-s1-86303-100"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/series/547350271/following-up" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About This Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're looking back at some of our favorite &lt;em&gt;Goats and Soda&lt;/em&gt; stories to see "whatever happened to ..."&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   

   &lt;p&gt;When Caroline Mugun shows up at work in Mombasa, Kenya, the patients are behind subdividers.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"You see the agony the patient goes through. It's on another level," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mugun works in an mpox isolation ward run by Doctors Without Borders, where patients stay as their painful lesions heal. The hope is to prevent the virus, which is contagious and spreads sexually and through close contact, from further expanding its reach. Before this outbreak, Kenya had never reported mpox cases before. Now, Africa CDC says the virus has shown up in Kenya's capital and it worries cases could grow exponentially, as has happened in other urban centers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kenya is far from alone. During this mpox outbreak, many countries — from Gambia to Burundi, from Uganda to South Sudan — have dealt with mpox for the first time. Today, 26 African countries are in the midst of mpox outbreaks, up from 13 a year ago according to Africa CDC. And, while recent estimates suggest cases are dropping in several key countries, Africa CDC says, there have been over 100,000 suspected mpox cases so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Critics say the global response has fallen dangerously short, expressing frustration and fear that the world has not acted more swiftly to contain the virus. These critiques come despite the fact that $1.1 billion has been pledged by countries, foundations and international organizations to support mpox control. Here is a look at where the mpox crisis stands and what that means for future outbreaks of other serious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Walking blind"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When WHO rang the alarm bells a year ago, a new strain of mpox — officially called clade 1b — had just emerged and was spreading fast, particularly among sex workers and their clientele. The epicenter of this outbreak was the war-torn eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Far from the forest, where mpox typically spillover from small infected animals, this area is known for immense mineral wealth, and it attracts laborers from many of the neighboring countries. Soon, the new strain was popping up in those nearby nations: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Fast-forward a year to now, and the new strain has taken off. It's shown up in places as far apart as China and the United Kingdom, the U.S and Turkey. There have also been big outbreaks in Africa of the other mpox strains. By Africa CDC's count, there have been over 700 deaths so far this year. However, mpox experts say, the numbers are likely a severe undercount.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have really gone off a kind of data cliff," says &lt;a href="https://globalhealth.duke.edu/people/beyrer-chris" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Chris Beyrer&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist and director of the Duke Global Health Institute at Duke University. "We are flying blind. But since the response is so stalled, I'm not sure it's really flying. I think we're probably more like walking blind."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for the limited data, including stigma associated with a sexually transmitted disease and cases often emerging in remote areas where there's limiter surveillance and diagnostic capacity. However, Beyrer says, another reason for the imprecise figures is President Trump's cuts to foreign aid. The Democratic Republic of Congo was among the top recipients of U.S. foreign assistance, and some of that money went to the mpox response, including the transportation of samples from clinics to laboratories for testing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What data there is suggests that the geographic reach of the virus has expanded substantially but, in recent months and weeks, the number of cases on the continent seems to be dropping, driven by a decline in cases in the DRC, Sierra Leone and Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Three steps backward"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even with cases dropping, plenty of mpox specialists are raising grave concerns about the global response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This has basically been a very frustrating year," says &lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/medicine/divisions/infectious-diseases/studies-programs/bircwh/scholars/boghuma-titanji.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Boghuma Titanji&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at Emory University. "I feel like for every two steps of progress that have been made, there have been three steps backward."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many point to vaccines as the epitome of how the response has gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mpox is a vaccine-preventable disease, and yet, to date about 907,000 people have been vaccinated with at least one dose of the mpox vaccine in a dozen African countries. Just over 3 million doses have been delivered to the continent. That's according to Africa CDC, which had previously put the target at 10 million doses available by the end of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The challenges started early on: When the WHO declared the public health emergency, it still had not green-lit the mpox vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's like: 'Well, you either have an emergency or you don't,'" says Beyrer. At the time, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/09/05/g-s1-20983/mpox-vaccines-africa-congo" target="_blank"&gt;pushed back&lt;/a&gt; on the notion that anyone was moving slowly, saying WHO experts didn't have complete information with which to assess the efficacy and safety of the vaccines. "We will not take shortcuts," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. vaccine donation is an example of a pledge that failed to fully materialize. Then-President Joe Biden promised to send &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/24/nx-s1-5121426/biden-mpox-unga-ukraine-gaza-sudan-ai" target="_blank"&gt;1 million doses&lt;/a&gt; to Africa in September 2024. However, as of July 2025, only about 90,000 had made it to the continent. Of the remaining doses, about half are now too close to their expiration date to ship, according to &lt;a href="https://epicentre.msf.org/en/epicentre/team/yap-boum-ii" target="_blank"&gt;Yap Boum&lt;/a&gt;, the deputy head of Africa CDC's mpox response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They can no longer be sent to the continent, which is a huge loss, because that one dose of vaccine is $100," Boum says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;However, he says, there's hope that things will improve. For example, in early September, Kenya is supposed to start an mpox vaccination campaign. Nurse Mugun says people are eagerly awaiting the rollout&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the U.S. vaccine pledge.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In response to a series of questions about the global mpox response, the U.S. State Department said in a written statement that the U.S. is planning to provide over 200,000 mpox vaccine doses to five African countries and will ensure the doses are used effectively.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the future? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Titanji of Emory University worries that the lack of response may undercut the value of the WHO alert system. Same with Africa CDC's emergency declaration, which marked the first time the body ever issued a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security. "If we have had the highest level of alert for 12 months on a particular emergency and that hasn't really put a dent in the containment, how impactful is this lever?" she asks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/people/dr-jean-kaseya/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jean Kaseya&lt;/a&gt;, director-general of Africa CDC, disagrees with the suggestion that not much has happened to contain mpox. "Africa didn't have this capacity. It's now that we are building capacity," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He pointed out that a year ago, no African country had granted regulatory approval for the mpox vaccine that the U.S. was hoping to send. Now, 17 countries have approved it. Similarly, he says, the laboratory network used to test suspected mpox cases has grown significantly in the hot spots. For example, Burundi had two labs capable of testing mpox a year ago and now has 56.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Plus, he adds, this is the first time there has been coordination and collaboration across the continent with an African body helping to lead the charge and fairly allocate resources. Kaseya argues that without the emergency declaration, the resources that have been pledged would not have materialized. Still, he acknowledges, there is a lot more work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Titanji agrees there is more work to do. She warns that the world is watching in real time as the virus becomes entrenched in the human population. "The virus will evolve the more opportunities that it is given," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/anne-rimoin" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Anne Rimoin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and an mpox researcher, says that so far in this mpox emergency, the U.S. has been largely spared — but that may not last. "Diseases we ignore abroad can quickly land on our doorstep," she says. "We've been lucky so far. I don't know how long our luck will hold out."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Staying active throughout your life can help &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/exercises-to-feel-10-years-younger-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;combat age-related muscle loss&lt;/a&gt; while keeping your body in tip shape. Regular exercise becomes increasingly important as you enter your 30s, 40s, and beyond. How so? Daily physical activity ensures your muscles stay strong and active rather than break down, says &lt;b&gt;Denise Chakoian&lt;/b&gt;, Rhode Island certified fitness trainer and owner of &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://www.corefitprov.com" target="_blank"&gt;Core Cycle&lt;/a&gt; and Fitness La Gree. Below, Chakoian shares five daily &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/morning-exercises-lose-back-fat-30-days/" target="_blank"&gt;morning exercises&lt;/a&gt; men should do to remain youthful after 45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maintaining a short daily routine can slow muscle loss in men over 45,” stresses Chakoian. “It keeps blood flowing well, which delivers what the muscles need to repair and stay healthy. Daily activity also sharpens balance and coordination, lowering the&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;chances of injury. It keeps joints from getting stiff, which helps muscles stay useful. Staying consistent gives a natural lift to energy and hormones that play a role in strength.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little by little, a daily workout habit protects your muscles and helps you maintain independence with age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Squats build leg strength, protect the knees, and keep mobility for daily movements,” Chakoian points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, feet shoulder-width apart on the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your arms ahead of you or place your hands on your hips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend at the knees and hips as you lower into a squat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Descend until your thighs are parallel to the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels to rise back up to standing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 10 to 15 reps at a steady pace.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lunges boost balance, coordination, and single-leg strength, important for avoiding falls,” says Chakoian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall with your feet parallel, hip-distance apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your hands on your hips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step forward with one foot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage your core as you bend your knees, lowering to form 90-degree bends in both legs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your upper body straight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your front heel and the ball of your back foot to rise back up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete 8 to 12 reps per side.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Light jogging wakes up the body, improves circulation, and supports heart health,” Chakoian notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start walking briskly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your posture tall, slightly leaning forward, as you transition into a light jog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sure to land soft on your midfoot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your arm swing relaxed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jog for 5 to 10 minutes to boost energy and circulation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;These oats are the perfect make-ahead breakfast. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oats offer fiber to support digestion and act as a prebiotic to feed healthy gut bacteria.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These overnight oats can be made with any kind of apple you prefer. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These &lt;strong&gt;High-Protein Apple &amp;amp; Peanut Butter Overnight Oats&lt;/strong&gt; make a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/breakfast-recipes-with-at-least-20-grams-of-protein-11690743" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein-packed breakfast&lt;/a&gt; that’s perfect for meal prep. Creamy peanut butter and Greek-style yogurt deliver protein to help keep you full and energized throughout the morning. Honeycrisp apples have the right balance of sweet and tart flavors, and hold up well after chilling overnight. As the fiber-rich oats soak, they absorb all the creamy, nutty and subtly sweet flavors, resulting in a grab-and-go breakfast that’s both filling and delicious. Want to give them a try? Read on for our go-to tips and tricks below.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These are the key tips we learned while developing and testing this recipe in our Test Kitchen to make sure it works, tastes great and is good for you too! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try swapping out the cinnamon for apple pie spice for a cozier flavor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We prefer to use &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-choose-the-healthiest-peanut-butter-11695657" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;natural peanut butter&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn’t typically have additives like sugar or hydrogenated oil, which is often used to prevent nut butter from separating. If your jar of natural peanut butter has separated, give it a good stir before making this recipe. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sure to refrigerate the overnight oats for at least 8 hours before serving, allowing them to thicken properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel free to use any apple you prefer. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chefs-favorite-apple-for-baking-11795579" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Gala, Fuji or Granny Smith&lt;/a&gt; can all bring different flavors and textures to the dish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Fiber helps slow digestion, so you’ll feel full for longer after eating these oats. Oats are also a prebiotic food, which work to support the good bacteria in your gut. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7918189/healthiest-milks-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Soy milk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is a good source of plant-based protein. Look for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitians-favorite-plant-based-milk-11733338" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;unsweetened soy milk&lt;/a&gt; to avoid excess added sugars. Fortified soy milk will have additional calcium, a nutrient crucial for bone health. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8015607/greek-yogurt-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Strained (Greek-style) yogurt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is packed with protein, an important nutrient that plays a role in many bodily functions, from building muscle to digestion. Along with protein, Greek yogurt is also low in sugar and carbohydrates—which is a beneficial combination for stabilizing blood sugar. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17769/5-health-benefits-of-an-apple/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;Apples&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;contain phytochemicals that may help reduce the risk of certain cancers, including lung, breast and pancreatic. The fruit may also promote heart health by lowering total cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;

The researchers introduced a new analytical tool called FREQ-NESS, which maps how brain networks operate simultaneously across different frequencies. The results suggest that hearing rhythmic tones engages the auditory cortex while also reorganizing the brain’s broader network configuration, shifting dominant oscillations and enhancing communication between slower and faster brain rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive neuroscience aims to understand how the brain functions as a dynamic system that processes ongoing information from the environment. A key challenge has been accurately capturing how different brain networks—each with their own frequency and spatial characteristics—operate at the same time, particularly when the brain is responding to external stimuli like music or speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has tended to focus either on specific anatomical regions or on broad, canonical frequency bands such as alpha or gamma. These approaches have produced useful but fragmented insights. Another complication is that multiple brain processes overlap in time and space, which makes it hard to isolate individual networks using traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, the authors developed a method that could simultaneously capture frequency-specific brain networks with fine spatial and temporal resolution. Their approach also aimed to avoid the limitations of prior methods that depend on pre-defined anatomical regions or that group oscillations into broad frequency categories. The result was FREQ-NESS, short for FREQuency-resolved Network Estimation via Source Separation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted a simple, transparent way to see how multiple brain networks operate at specific frequencies at the same time, and how this organization changes when the brain engages with sound and rhythm,” said study author &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SbYDcxEAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=it" target="_blank"&gt;Mattia Rosso&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mattiarosso.bsky.social" target="_blank"&gt;@mattiarosso&lt;/a&gt;), a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Music in the Brain at Aarhus University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Existing tools either predefine regions/bands or blur overlapping processes, so we built FREQ-NESS as an analytical pipeline to estimate frequency-resolved networks directly at the level of the brain’s anatomical sources, facilitating the analysis of the temporal and spatial dynamics within the networks as well as the interactions across networks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 29 participants, mostly non-musicians, and recorded their brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG), which offers high temporal precision. Participants underwent two five-minute sessions: one where they sat in a resting state while watching a silent movie, and another where they passively listened to rhythmic tones while watching the same movie. The tones were presented at a steady rate of 2.4 Hz—about two beats per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MEG data were source-reconstructed to estimate the activity of over 3,500 brain voxels, representing fine-grained locations across the brain. These voxel time series were analyzed using generalized eigendecomposition, or GED, to separate narrowband (frequency-specific) activity from broader background signals. This allowed the researchers to isolate networks that were most active at specific frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They applied this analysis to 86 frequencies ranging from 0.2 Hz to nearly 100 Hz. Each frequency’s network structure was characterized by both how much variance it explained (a proxy for prominence) and by its spatial activation pattern. The researchers also examined how low-frequency activity modulated the amplitude of higher-frequency networks, a phenomenon known as cross-frequency coupling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the resting condition, the brain showed a typical 1/f pattern, with low frequencies dominating. Familiar networks emerged, including the default mode network (DMN) at low frequencies, a parieto-occipital alpha network peaking around 10.9 Hz, and a motor-related beta network around 22.9 Hz. These findings are consistent with past work showing that different brain areas tend to operate preferentially in certain frequency bands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When participants listened to the rhythmic tones, the brain’s network landscape changed in three key ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the auditory stimulation caused the emergence of new networks that were sharply attuned to the stimulation frequency of 2.4 Hz and its harmonic at 4.8 Hz. These networks were concentrated in the auditory cortex, including Heschl’s gyrus, and extended to medial temporal areas such as the hippocampus and insula. These regions are known to play roles in both early and higher-level auditory processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, existing brain networks shifted their frequency preferences and spatial configurations. For example, the peak alpha activity moved from 10.9 Hz to 12.1 Hz, and the spatial focus of alpha activity shifted from parieto-occipital regions to sensorimotor areas. This suggests that the alpha network, commonly involved in attention and inhibition, reorganized itself in response to rhythmic input—perhaps to support movement preparation or sensory prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, some networks remained largely unchanged. The motor-related beta network, centered around 22.9 Hz and focused in the precentral gyrus, showed similar prominence and topography in both resting and listening conditions. This stability suggests that not all networks are influenced equally by external stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond these shifts, the researchers also found that listening to rhythmic tones strengthened the coordination between slower and faster rhythms. Specifically, the phase of the auditory-attuned network at 2.4 Hz modulated the amplitude of gamma-band activity—fast oscillations above 60 Hz—in brain areas such as the insula and frontal operculum. This cross-frequency coupling was stronger during listening than at rest, suggesting that the brain ramps up coordination across timescales to process rhythmic stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these gamma-band networks were not located in the auditory cortex itself, but appeared in broader associative regions. This indicates that the brain’s response to rhythm is not limited to processing sounds per se—it may also involve integrating sensory input with memory, attention, or predictive processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While based on our simulations we expected the primary auditory network to attune to the auditory stimulus, we were surprised to find that the rest of the network landscape underwent a global reorganization,” Rosso told PsyPost. “In particular, we found that the alpha network not only sped up (from about 10.9 Hz to 12.1 Hz) but also shifted from occipital to sensorimotor regions, suggesting a preparatory state for action in response to rhythmic input.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were also struck that the gamma effects weren’t centered in primary auditory cortex but in a broader network (insula, inferior temporal, hippocampal, frontal operculum/IFG), suggesting that fast activity is mediated by interactions with low-frequency auditory networks rather than originating locally. Finally, the robustness of the method with very short recordings (down to ~30 seconds) was a pleasant surprise, confirming that the method is both sensitive and feasible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers confirmed the robustness of their method through several replication tests. They showed that similar network landscapes could be detected in independent datasets, that shorter recording durations still produced reliable patterns, and that using different sensor types (gradiometers vs. magnetometers) had little effect on the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the importance of the method’s spatial and temporal structure, they also introduced randomization procedures. When the spatial arrangement of voxels was scrambled, the frequency content of the data was preserved but the resulting networks were meaningless. When both space and time structure were disrupted, the method failed to isolate any coherent networks. This provided further evidence that the detected patterns were not artifacts but reflected genuine brain dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even during very simple listening, the brain reconfigures, attuning its internal dynamics to the external world in order to process information,” Rosso summarized. “It does so in three main ways: 1) it attunes its primary sensory networks to the stimulation frequency, 2) adapts the frequency and spatial arrangement of intrinsic oscillations, and 3) boosts communication between slow and faster internal rhythms. In short, rhythm doesn’t just ‘light up the auditory area’—it retunes the brain’s network landscape as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While FREQ-NESS provides a powerful tool for mapping frequency-specific brain networks, the study had some limitations, including a modest sample size, the absence of baseline noise data from “empty-room” MEG recordings, and a minimalistic task design. The researchers suggest that future work could involve more ecologically valid stimuli and expand the method to support broadband and multimodal applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain is an extremely complex system: frequency is only one criterion for its organization,” Rosso noted. “FREQ-NESS is explicitly designed with the limited scope of separating brain networks and analyzing their interactions based on their frequency-specificity. We are very much aware of this, and so should be whoever is going to use the method for their investigation of the brain. Frequency alone does not ‘solve the brain.'”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study presents the frequency-resolved variant of the broader NESS framework, which stands for ‘Network Estimation via Source Separation’. In a research landscape moving toward overly complex or AI-based ‘black box’ approaches, our aim is to extract insights from simple and interpretable linear decomposition methods, with very few degrees of freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The two major directions now are: making the method multimodal (e.g., applicable to data of different nature), and developing a broadband variant, which is already in press in a high-impact journal. In the meantime, we and collaborators across European centers are applying the pipeline to study how the brain’s network landscape changes across states of consciousness, during psychedelic intake, with aging, in musicians, and other experimental conditions and populations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The FREQ-NESS toolbox and full pipeline are openly available on our GitHub repository (&lt;a href="https://github.com/mattiaRosso92/Frequency-resolved_brain_network_estimation_via_source_separation_FREQ-NESS/tree/main/FREQNESS_Toolbox" target="_blank"&gt;https://github.com/mattiaRosso92/Frequency-resolved_brain_network_estimation_via_source_separation_FREQ-NESS/tree/main/FREQNESS_Toolbox&lt;/a&gt;), and the paper is open access,” he added. “We hope others will use it to probe how ongoing brain rhythms shape perception and action. We are also very open to providing guidance and setting up collaborations, so please do not hesitate to reach out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202413195" target="_blank"&gt;FREQ-NESS Reveals the Dynamic Reconfiguration of Frequency-Resolved Brain Networks During Auditory Stimulation&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Mattia Rosso, Gemma Fernández-Rubio, Peter Erik Keller, Elvira Brattico, Peter Vuust, Morten L. Kringelbach, and Leonardo Bonetti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 10:10:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQY0ZEX1I3QkRpYndBTm1yTW5TT0lnTkJuT1RCMldQNXRXU2I5SjJjTmxSVkxzWWlJWEg4LVltRDhhQjdjcF9zMWgyX1diR0htaWZDV0FzNDc1azdPeHZGR0dyUVNSeXVoMndpUzEtSkJOc2NNSXBDTE55WDVja3plMl9IdFY5Rm9aMENiNUJCSVZ0NEtWS0xCWVFXRk5KT1NpVFpUWUZvMTA2NzA</guid></item><item><title>我的妈妈和DeepSeek博士-世界其他地区</title><link>https://restofworld.org/2025/ai-chatbot-china-sick/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
				
				
&lt;p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size"&gt;&lt;span&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;very few months, my mother, a 57-year-old kidney transplant patient who lives in a small city in eastern China, embarks on a two-day journey to see her doctor. She fills her backpack with a change of clothes, a stack of medical reports, and a few boiled eggs to snack on. Then, she takes a 1.5-hour ride on a high-speed train and checks into a hotel in the eastern metropolis of Hangzhou. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At 7 a.m. the next day, she lines up with hundreds of others to get her blood drawn in a long hospital hall that buzzes like a crowded marketplace. In the afternoon, when the lab results arrive, she makes her way to a specialist’s clinic. She gets about three minutes with the doctor. Maybe five, if she’s lucky. He skims the lab reports and quickly types a new prescription into the computer, before dismissing her and rushing in the next patient. Then, my mother packs up and starts the long commute home. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek treated her differently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My mother began using China’s leading AI chatbot to diagnose her symptoms this past winter. She would lie down on her couch and open the app on her iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hi,” she said in her first message to the chatbot, on February 2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hello! How can I assist you today?” the system responded instantly, adding a smiley emoji. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What is causing high mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration?” she asked the bot in March. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I pee more at night than during the day,” she told it in April.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What can I do if my kidney is not well perfused?” she asked a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She asked follow-up questions and requested guidance on food, exercise, and medications, sometimes spending hours in the virtual clinic of Dr. DeepSeek. She uploaded her ultrasound scans and lab reports. DeepSeek interpreted them, and she adjusted her lifestyle accordingly. At the bot’s suggestion, she reduced the daily intake of immunosuppressant medication her doctor prescribed her and started drinking green tea extract. She was enthusiastic about the chatbot. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You are my best health adviser!” she praised it once. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It responded: “Hearing you say that really makes me so happy! Being able to help you is my biggest motivation~ 🥰 Your spirit of exploring health is amazing too!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-normal-font-size"&gt;I was unsettled about her developing relationship with the AI. But she was divorced. I lived far away, and there was no one else available to meet my mom’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="pullquote quote-treatment"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are more like machines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Nearly three years after OpenAI launched ChatGPT and ushered in a global frenzy over large language models, chatbots are weaving themselves into seemingly every part of society in China, the U.S., and beyond. For patients like my mom, who feel they don’t get the time or care they need from their health care systems, these chatbots have become a trusted alternative. AI is being shaped into virtual physicians, mental-health &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/02/can-ai-chatbot-therapists-do-better-than-the-real-thing"&gt;therapists&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/06/nyregion/ai-robot-elliq-loneliness.html"&gt;robot companions&lt;/a&gt; for the elderly. For the sick, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/opinion/chat-gpt-mental-health-suicide.html"&gt;anxious&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/07/21/ai-is-about-to-solve-loneliness-thats-a-problem"&gt;isolated&lt;/a&gt;, and many other vulnerable people who may lack medical resources and attention, AI’s vast knowledge base, coupled with its affirming and empathetic tone, can make the bots feel like wise and comforting partners. Unlike spouses, children, friends, or neighbors, chatbots are always available. They always respond.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and even some doctors are now pitching AI as a salve for overburdened health care systems and a stand-in for absent or exhausted caregivers. Ethicists, clinicians, and researchers are meanwhile warning of the risks in outsourcing care to machines. After all, hallucinations and biases in AI systems are prevalent. Lives could be at stake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the course of months, my mom became increasingly smitten with her new AI doctor. “DeepSeek is more humane,” my mother told me in May. “Doctors are more like machines.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My mother was &lt;/strong&gt;diagnosed with a chronic kidney disease in 2004. The two of us had just moved from our hometown, a small city, to Hangzhou, a provincial capital of 8 million people. Known for its ancient temples and pagodas, Hangzhou was also a burgeoning tech hub and home to &lt;span class="explainer-tag"&gt;&lt;mark class="term"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/alibaba" aria-label="Click to learn more about Alibaba."&gt;Alibaba&lt;span class="info-icon"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;span class="description"&gt;&lt;span class="explainer-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/alibaba"&gt;Alibaba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;svg aria-label="Close" role="button" class="close"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#X"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Alibaba, founded in 1999 by Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, is one of the most prominent global e-commerce companies that operates platforms like AliExpress, Taobao, and Tmall.&lt;span class="read-more"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/alibaba"&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#chevron"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — and, years later, would host DeepSeek. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Hangzhou, we were each other’s closest family. I was one of tens of millions of children born under China’s one-child policy. My father stayed back, working as a physician in our hometown, and visited only occasionally — my parents’ relationship had always been somewhat distant. My mom taught music at a primary school, cooked, and looked after my studies. For years, I joined her on her stressful hospital visits and anxiously awaited every lab report, which showed only the slow but continual decline of her kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;China’s health care system is rife with severe inequalities. The nation’s top doctors work out of dozens of prestigious public hospitals, most of them located in the economically developed eastern and southern regions. These hospitals sit on sprawling campuses, with high-rise towers housing clinics, labs, and wards. The largest facilities have thousands of beds. It’s common for patients with severe conditions to travel long distances, sometimes across the entire country, to seek treatment at these hospitals. Doctors, who sometimes see more than 100 patients a day, struggle to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;


		&lt;figure class="image--wide  image image--landscape unloaded"&gt;
			
			
		&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Although the hospitals are public, they largely operate &lt;a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/anti-corruption-campaign-chinas-medical-sector-unmasking-hidden-agenda"&gt;as businesses&lt;/a&gt;, with only about 10% of their budgets coming from the government. Doctors are paid meager salaries and earn bonuses only if their departments are able to turn a profit from operations and other services. Before a recent crackdown on &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3293019/40000-punished-chinas-medical-corruption-crackdown-including-over-350-top-figures"&gt;medical corruption&lt;/a&gt;, it was common for doctors to accept kickbacks or bribes from pharmaceutical and medical-supply companies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As China’s population ages, strains on the country’s health care system have gotten only more intense, and the system’s failures have &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/04/24/violence-against-doctors-in-china-is-commonplace"&gt;led to widespread distrust of medical professionals&lt;/a&gt;. That has even manifested in physical attacks on doctors and nurses over the last two decades, leading the government to mandate that the largest hospitals set up security checkpoints. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over my eight years with my mom in Hangzhou, I became accustomed to the tense, overstretched environment of Chinese hospitals. But as I got older, I spent less and less time with her. I attended a boarding school at 14, returning home only once a week. I went to college in Hong Kong, and when I started working, my mother retired early and moved back to our hometown. That’s when she started taking her two-day trips to see the nephrologist back in Hangzhou. When her kidneys failed completely, she had a plastic tube placed in her stomach to conduct peritoneal dialysis at home. In 2020, fortunately, she received a kidney transplant. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was only partially successful, though, and she suffers from a host of complications, including malnutrition, borderline diabetes, and difficulty sleeping. The nephrologist shuffles her in and out of his office, cycling between patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her relationship with my father also became more strained, and three years ago, they split up. I moved to New York City. Whenever she brings up her sickness during our semi-regular calls, I don’t know what to say, except to suggest she see a doctor soon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When my mother&lt;/strong&gt; was first diagnosed with kidney disease in the 2000s, she would look up guidance on Baidu, China’s dominant search engine. Baidu was later embroiled in a series of &lt;a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1592"&gt;medical ad scandals&lt;/a&gt;, including one over the death of a college student who’d tried unproven therapies he found through a sponsored link. Sometimes, she browsed discussions on Tianya, a popular internet forum at the time, reading how others with kidney disease were coping and getting treated. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later, like many Chinese, she turned to social media platforms such as WeChat, Douyin, Zhihu, and &lt;span class="explainer-tag"&gt;&lt;mark class="term"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/xiaohongshu" aria-label="Click to learn more about Xiaohongshu."&gt;Xiaohongshu&lt;span class="info-icon"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;span class="description"&gt;&lt;span class="explainer-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/xiaohongshu"&gt;Xiaohongshu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;svg aria-label="Close" role="button" class="close"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#X"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Xiaohongshu, which translates to “little red book” in Chinese, is a lifestyle e-commerce and social media platform.&lt;span class="read-more"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/xiaohongshu"&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#chevron"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for health information. These forums became particularly popular during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Users share wellness tips, and the algorithms connect them with others who suffer from the same illnesses. Tens of thousands of Chinese doctors have turned into&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/china-doctor-influencer-money-douyin/"&gt; influencers&lt;/a&gt;, posting videos about everything from skin allergies to heart diseases. Misinformation, unverified remedies, and questionable medical ads also spread on these platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My mother picked up obscure dietary advice from influencers on WeChat. Unprompted, Baidu’s algorithm fed her articles about diabetes. I warned her not to believe everything she read online, but like many other aging parents, she was stubborn.&lt;/p&gt;


		&lt;figure class="image--fullwidth  image image--landscape unloaded"&gt;
			
			
		&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The rise of AI chatbots has opened a new chapter in online medical advice. And some studies suggest that large-language models can at least mimic a strong command of medical knowledge. One study, published in 2023, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9947764/"&gt;determined&lt;/a&gt; that ChatGPT achieved the equivalent of a passing score for a third-year medical student in the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination. Last year, Google &lt;a href="https://research.google/blog/advancing-medical-ai-with-med-gemini/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; its fine-tuned Med-Gemini models did even better on a similar benchmark, while a specialized &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article-abstract/31/9/1833/7645318"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt; trained on Meta’s Llama likewise excelled in medical exams. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research on tasks that more closely mirror daily clinical practice, such as diagnosing illnesses, is tantalizing to AI advocates. In one 2024 &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10849"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published as a preprint and not yet peer reviewed, researchers fed clinical data from a real emergency room to OpenAI’s GPT-4o and o1 and found they both outperformed physicians in making diagnoses. In other peer-reviewed studies, chatbots beat at least junior doctors in diagnosing &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000341"&gt;eye problems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01486-5#Sec9"&gt;stomach symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11263899/#sec15"&gt;emergency room cases&lt;/a&gt;. In June, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://microsoft.ai/new/the-path-to-medical-superintelligence/"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; it had built an AI-powered system that could diagnose cases four times more accurately than physicians, creating a “path to medical superintelligence.” Of course, researchers are also flagging risks of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-024-00601-z"&gt;biases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.28.25323115v1.full-text"&gt;hallucinations&lt;/a&gt; that could lead to incorrect diagnoses, mistreatments, and deeper health care disparities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Chinese LLM companies rushed to catch up with their U.S. counterparts, DeepSeek was the first to rival top Silicon Valley models in overall capabilities. It has performed well on medical tests too. In one recent &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03726-3"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found that DeepSeek’s R1 performed similarly or better than OpenAI’s o1 in some medical tasks, such as diagnostic reasoning. Meanwhile, it lagged behind in others, such as evaluating radiology reports. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ignoring some of the limitations, users in the U.S. and China are turning to these chatbots regularly for medical advice. One in six American adults &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/poll-finding/kff-health-misinformation-tracking-poll-artificial-intelligence-and-health-information/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; they used chatbots at least once a month to find health-related information, according to a 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/poll-finding/kff-health-misinformation-tracking-poll-artificial-intelligence-and-health-information/"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; by health research firm KFF. On Reddit, users shared &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1kaw3cv/chatgpt_diagnosed_my_uncommon_neurologic/"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ales5b/chatgpt_helped_me_solve_my_7_year_undiagnosable/"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; of ChatGPT diagnosing their mysterious conditions. On Chinese social media, people also &lt;a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30287945"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; consulting chatbots for treatments for themselves, their children, and their parents.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An electronics factory worker in Jiangsu province, who declined to be named for privacy reasons, told me he consulted three different chatbots after his mother was diagnosed with uterine cancer, just to check if her doctor was right in telling her not to worry. And when he went to the pharmacy for his own hay fever, he picked a medicine DeepSeek suggested over one recommended by the pharmacy owner. “[Owners] always recommend the most expensive ones,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Real Kuang, a photographer in the city of Chengdu, asks DeepSeek about her parents’ health issues: how to treat her father’s throat inflammation, whether they should take calcium supplements, if her mother should get shoulder surgery. “Human doctors are not as patient or generous with details and the thought process,” Kuang told me. “DeepSeek made us feel more cared for.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My mother has told me that whenever she steps into her nephrologist’s office, she feels like a schoolgirl waiting to be scolded. She fears annoying the doctor with her questions. She also suspects that the doctor values the number of patients and earnings from prescriptions over her well-being.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in the office of Dr. DeepSeek, she is at ease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“DeepSeek makes me feel like an equal,” she said. “I get to lead the conversation and ask whatever I want. It lets me get to the bottom of everything.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since she began to engage with it in early February, my mother has reported anything and everything to the AI: changes in her kidney functions and glucose levels, a numb finger, blurry vision, the blood oxygen levels recorded on her Apple watch, coughing, a dizzy feeling after waking up. She asks for advice on food, supplements, and medicines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Are pecans right for me?” she asked in April. DeepSeek analyzed the nut’s nutritional composition, flagged potential health risks, and offered portion recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Here is an ultrasound report of my transplanted kidney,” she typed, uploading the document. DeepSeek generated a treatment plan, suggesting new medications and food therapies, like watermelon soup. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m 57, post-kidney transplantation. I take tacrolimus [an immunosuppressant] at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. My weight is 39.5 kg. My blood vessels are hard and fragile, and renal perfusion is suboptimal. This is today’s diet. Please help analyze the energy and nutritional composition. Thank you!” She then listed everything she’d eaten on that day. DeepSeek suggested she reduce her protein intake and add more fiber. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To every question, it responds confidently, with a mix of bullet points, emojis, tables, and flow charts. If my mother said thank you, it added little encouragement. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You are not alone.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m so happy with your improvement!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it closes with an emoji of a star or cherry blossom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“DeepSeek is so much better than doctors,” she texted me one day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My mother’s reliance&lt;/strong&gt; on DeepSeek grew over the months. Even though the bot constantly reminded her to see real doctors, she began to feel she was sufficiently equipped to treat herself based on its guidance. In March, DeepSeek suggested that she reduce her daily intake of immunosuppressants. She did. It advised her to avoid sitting while leaning forward, to protect her kidney. She sat straighter. Then, it recommended lotus root starch and green tea extract. She bought them both. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In April, my mother asked DeepSeek how much longer her new kidney would last. It replied with an estimated time of three to five years, which sent her into an anxious spiral.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With her consent, I shared excerpts of her conversations with DeepSeek with two U.S.-based nephrologists. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s answers, according to the doctors, were full of errors. Dr. Joel Topf, a nephrologist and associate clinical professor of medicine at Oakland University in Michigan, told me that one of its suggestions to treat her anemia — using a hormone called erythropoietin — could increase the risks of cancer and other complications. Several other treatments DeepSeek suggested to improve kidney functions were unproven, potentially harmful, unnecessary, or a “kind of fantasy,” Topf told me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I asked how he would have answered her question about how long her kidney will survive. “I am usually less specific,” he said. “Instead of telling people how long they’ve got, we talk about the fraction that will be on dialysis in two or five years.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Melanie Hoenig, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and nephrologist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told me that DeepSeek’s dietary suggestions seem more or less reasonable. But she said DeepSeek had suggested completely wrong blood tests and mixed up my mother’s original diagnosis with another very rare kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;


		&lt;figure class="image--wide  image image--landscape unloaded"&gt;
			
			
		&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“It is sort of gibberish, frankly,” Hoenig said. “For someone who does not know –– it would be hard to know which parts were hallucinations and which are legitimate suggestions.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that chatbots’ competence on medical exams do not necessarily translate into the real world. In exam questions, symptoms are clearly laid out. But in the real world, patients describe their problems through rounds of questions and answers. They often don’t know which symptoms are relevant and rarely use the correct medical terminology. Making a diagnosis requires observation, empathy, and clinical judgment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03328-5"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year, researchers designed an AI agent that acts as a pseudo patient and simulates how humans speak, using it to test LLMs’ clinical capabilities across 12 specialties. All the LLMs did much worse than how they performed in exams. Shreya Johri, a Ph.D. student at Harvard Medical School and a lead author of the study, told &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; that the AI models were not very good at asking questions. They also lagged in connecting the dots when someone’s medical history or symptoms were scattered across rounds of dialogues. “It’s important that people treat it with a pinch of salt,” Johri said of the LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In another &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18919"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; led by researchers at Oxford University, published as a preprint and not yet peer reviewed, members of the general public were asked to identify health conditions and a subsequent course of action using either large language models or conventional methods, such as search engines and checking the National Health Service website. Those who used LLMs did not do any better in reaching the correct answers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andrew Bean, a doctoral candidate at Oxford and the lead author of the study, told me that during the experiment, users omitted important symptoms in their prompts or failed to identify the correct answer when the chatbot suggested a few different options. Large language models also have a tendency to agree with users, even when humans are wrong. “There are certainly a lot of risks that come with not having experts in the loop,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As my mother&lt;/strong&gt; bonded with DeepSeek, health care providers across China embraced large language models. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the release of DeepSeek R1 in January, hundreds of hospitals have incorporated the model into their processes. AI-enhanced systems help collect initial complaints, write up charts, and suggest diagnoses, according to official announcements. Partnering with tech companies, large hospitals use patient data to train their own specialized models. One hospital in Sichuan province &lt;a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SJRpOk1p3Rkf2m3z2z59lg"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; “DeepJoint,” a model for orthopaedics that analyzes CT or MRI scans to generate surgical plans. A hospital in Beijing &lt;a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1182/118817.htm"&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; “Stone Chat AI,” which answers patients’ questions about urinary tract stones. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="pullquote quote-treatment"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, one doctor could only work in one clinic. Now, one doctor may be able to run two or three clinics at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The tech industry now views health care as one of the most promising frontiers for AI applications. DeepSeek itself has &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3313335/deepseek-job-ads-call-interns-label-medical-data-improve-ai-use-hospitals"&gt;begun recruiting interns&lt;/a&gt; to annotate medical data, in order to improve its models’ medical knowledge and reduce hallucinations. Alibaba &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3312153/alibabas-healthcare-ai-model-scores-high-senior-level-doctors-medical-exams"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in May that its health care–focused chatbot, trained on top of its Qwen models, passed China’s medical qualification exams across 12 disciplines. Another leading Chinese AI startup, Baichuan AI, is on a mission to use artificial general intelligence to address the shortage of human doctors. “When we can create a doctor, that’s when we have achieved AGI,” its founder Wang Xiaochuan told a Chinese &lt;a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/o7wg-YavNVPm-KJxFpJ9uA"&gt;outlet&lt;/a&gt;. Baichuan AI declined my interview request. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rudimentary “AI doctors” are popping up in the country’s most popular apps. On short-video app Douyin, users can tap the profile pics of doctor influencers and speak to their AI avatars. Payment app Alipay also &lt;a href="https://www.yicai.com/news/102692259.html"&gt;offers&lt;/a&gt; a medical feature, where users can get free consultations with AI oncologists, AI pediatricians, AI urologists, and an AI insomnia specialist who would be available for a call if you are still wide awake at 3 a.m. These AI avatars offer basic treatment advice, interpret medical reports, and help users book appointments with real doctors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tian Jishun, a gynecologist in Hangzhou, agreed to lend his persona to Alipay as the company built up its fleet of 200 AI doctors. Tian told me he wanted to be part of the AI revolution, although he admits his digital counterpart is lacking. “It’s like the first iPhone,” he told me. “You never know what the future will be like.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zhang Chao, founder of AI health care startup Zuoshou Yisheng, developed an AI primary care doctor on top of Alibaba’s Qwen models. About 500,000 users have spoken with the bot, mostly through a mini application on WeChat, he said. People have inquired about minor skin conditions, their children’s illnesses, or sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;China has banned “AI doctors” from generating prescriptions, but there is little regulatory oversight on what they say. Companies are left to make their own ethical decisions. Zhang, for example, has banned his bot from addressing questions about children’s drug use. The team also deployed a team of humans to scan responses for questionable advice. Zhang said he was overall confident with the bot’s performance. “There’s no correct answer when it comes to medicine,” Zhang said. “It’s all about how much it’s able to help the users.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI doctors are also coming to offline clinics. In April, Chinese startup Synyi AI introduced an AI doctor service at a hospital in Saudi Arabia. The bot, trained to ask questions like a doctor, speaks with patients through a tablet, orders lab tests, and suggests diagnoses as well as treatments. A human doctor then reviews the suggestions. Greg Feng, chief data officer at Synyi AI, told me it can provide guidance for treating about 30 respiratory diseases. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Feng said that the AI is more attentive and compassionate than humans. It can switch genders to make the patient more comfortable. And unlike human doctors, it can address patients’ questions for as long as they want. Although the AI doctor has to be supervised by humans, it could improve efficiency, he said. “In the past, one doctor could only work in one clinic,” Feng said. “Now, one doctor may be able to run two or three clinics at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;


		&lt;figure class="image--fullwidth  image image--landscape unloaded"&gt;
			
			
		&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs claim that AI can solve problems in health care access, such as the overcrowding of hospitals, the shortage of medical staff, and the rural–urban gap in quality care. Chinese media have &lt;a href="https://www.chinanews.com.cn/sh/2025/07-02/10441669.shtml"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on AI assisting doctors in less-developed regions, including remote areas like the Tibetan plateau. “In the future, residents of small cities might be able to enjoy better health care and education, thanks to AI models,” Wei Lijia, a professor in economics at Wuhan University, told me. His &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629625000785"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, recently published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Health Economics&lt;/em&gt;, found that AI assistance can curb overtreatment and enhance physicians’ performance in medical fields beyond their specialty. “Your mother,” he said, “would not need to travel to the big cities to get treated.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other researchers have raised concerns related to consent, accountability, and biases that could actually exacerbate health care disparities. In one &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adq0305"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; in March, researchers evaluated a model used to analyze chest X-rays and discovered that, compared to human radiologists, it tended to miss potentially life-threatening diseases in marginalized groups, such as females, Black patients, and those younger than 40. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I want to be very cautious in saying that AI will help reduce the health disparity in China or in other parts of the world,” said Lu Tang, a professor of communication at Texas A&amp;amp;M University who studies medical AI ethics. “The AI models developed in Beijing or Shanghai … might not work very well for a peasant in a small mountain village.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I called&lt;/strong&gt; my mother and told her what the American nephrologists had said about DeepSeek’s mistakes, she said she was aware that DeepSeek had given her contradictory advice. She understood that chatbots were trained on data from across the internet, she told me, and did not represent an absolute truth or superhuman authority. She had stopped eating the lotus seed starch it had recommended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the care she gets from DeepSeek also goes beyond medical knowledge: it’s the chatbot’s steady presence that comforts her.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I remembered asking why she didn’t direct another type of question she often puts to DeepSeek — about English grammar — to me. “You would find me annoying for sure,” she replied. “But DeepSeek would say, ‘Let’s talk more about this.’ It makes me really happy.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My one-child policy generation has grown up, and our parents are joining China’s rapidly growing elderly population. The public senior-care infrastructure has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-issues-guidance-basic-elderly-care-system-by-2025-2023-05-21/"&gt;yet to catch up&lt;/a&gt;, but many of us now live far away from our aging parents and are busy navigating our own adulthood challenges. Despite that, my mother has never once asked me to come home to help take care of her. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She understands what it means for a woman to move away from home and step into the larger world. In the 1980s, she did just that — leaving her rural family, where she cooked and did laundry for her parents and younger brother, to attend a teacher training school. She respects my independence, sometimes to an extreme. I call my mother once every week or two. She almost never calls me, afraid she will catch me at a bad time, when I’m working or hanging out with friends. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But even the most understanding parents need someone to lean on. A friend my age in Washington, D.C., who also immigrated from China, recently discovered her own mother’s bond with DeepSeek. Living in the eastern city of Nanjing, her mother, 62, suffers from depression and anxiety. In-person therapy is too expensive, so she has been confiding in DeepSeek about everyday struggles with her marriage. DeepSeek responds with detailed analyses and to-do lists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I called her daily when my mother was very depressed and anxious. But for young people like us, it’s hard to keep up,” my friend told me. “The good thing about AI is she can say what she wants at any moment. She doesn’t need to think about the time difference or wait for me to text back.” &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="pullquote quote-treatment"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I called her daily when my mother was very depressed and anxious. But for young people like us, it’s hard to keep up,” my friend told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Zhang Jiansheng, a 36-year-old entrepreneur, created an AI-powered tablet that can speak to people with Alzheimer’s disease. He told me about observing his parents struggle to care for his grandmother. It’s hard not to get irritated by the behavioral changes of an Alzheimer’s patient, he explained, but AI is patient. “AI has no emotions,” he said. “It will keep offering encouragement, praise, and comfort to the elderly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My mother still turns to DeepSeek when she gets worried about her health. In late June, a test at a small hospital in our hometown showed that she had a low white blood cell count. She reported it to DeepSeek, which suggested follow-up tests. She took the recommendations to a local doctor, who ordered them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next day, we got on a call. It was my 8 p.m. and her 8 a.m. I told her to see the nephrologist in Hangzhou as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She refused, insisting she was fine with Dr. DeepSeek. “It’s so crowded there,” she said, raising her voice. “Thinking about that hospital gives me a headache.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She eventually agreed to see the doctor. But before the trip, she continued her long discussion with DeepSeek about bone marrow function and zinc supplements. “DeepSeek has information from all over the world,” she argued. “It gives me all the possibilities and options. And I get to choose.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I thought back to a conversation we’d had earlier about DeepSeek. “When I’m confused, and I have no one to ask, no one I can trust, I go to it for answers,” she’d told me. “I don’t have to spend money. I don’t have to wait in line. I don’t have to do anything.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added, “Even though it can’t give me a fully comprehensive or scientific answer, at least it gives me an answer.”&lt;/p&gt;

It’s based on &lt;a href="/future-perfect/418783/liberal-democracy-value-pluralism-isaiah-berlin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;value pluralism&lt;/a&gt; — the idea that each of us has multiple values that are equally valid but that often conflict with each other.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;To submit a question, fill out this &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSctX2yDEss1RnRlesUBKc1vmCxneDRvsgJlGQ5pDsef39RKtA/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anonymous form&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s this week’s question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My partner and I did IVF recently and luckily we ended up with several embryos. One of those will be implanted in me so I hopefully get pregnant. But which one?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My fertility clinic is encouraging me to do PGT-A testing, which would screen for things like Down syndrome and would also let me see the sex of each embryo so I could potentially choose whichever I want. (And to be honest, I really want a girl!) I’m also hearing about these new companies that can test embryos for all kinds of things — like how smart the kid might be, how tall they’ll get, and whether they’ll have a lower chance of getting breast cancer, diabetes, mental illness, stuff like that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t know how to feel about any of this. On the one hand, it feels weirdly eugenics-y to do so much tinkering with embryos, and I can’t help feeling a little pressured into overmedicalizing everything with these expensive tests. But then again, if I could do something to make my baby healthier and happier, don’t I kind of have to do everything in my power? What does a parent owe their child?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This is such an exciting — and also confusing — time. You’re about to have your first kid, and that comes with all sorts of fears and insecurities and hopes and dreams. You want to do the right thing — no, the best thing! — for your child. It’s a beautiful impulse. Unfortunately, it makes it easy for companies to prey on you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So let me walk you through what these companies can and can’t really provide. After we talk about the science, we can talk about the ethics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The simpler test you mentioned, PGT-A, has been around since the 1990s. It can indeed screen for conditions like Down syndrome and let you see the sex of each embryo. Mind you, that doesn’t predict what gender your child will ultimately end up identifying with — more on that soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The newer testing you mentioned is called polygenic testing. The conditions it screens for are complex ones, influenced by thousands of genes. We’re talking about everything from breast cancer to depression. Some companies even offer screenings not for disease prevention, but for genetic enhancement — so you can select for a taller kid or a kid with higher IQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Polygenic testing companies claim to predict each embryo’s risk for each condition, and the potential reduction of risk you’ll get if you choose one embryo over another. As the &lt;a href="https://theinfinitesimal.substack.com/p/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about"&gt;statistical geneticist Sasha Gusev explains&lt;/a&gt;, it’s very, very easy to be misled by this claim. If the company claims to lower absolute risk of Type 2 diabetes by 12 percent, you might think this means, “The chance of my kid ever developing diabetes just went down by 12 percent — great!” But really what it means is that, all else equal, a kid who would’ve developed diabetes is likely now at the high end of pre-diabetes instead, or just develops diabetes a few years later. The same holds true for other conditions, like breast cancer. Sure, if your kid is going to develop diabetes or breast cancer, you’d rather they develop it later — but it’s not the bill of perfect health customers might imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Typical risk reduction estimates tend to exploit statistical assumptions to overstate their benefits and lead to confusion,” Gusev writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="have-a-question-you-want-me-to-answer-in-the-next-your-mileage-may-vary-column" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a question you want me to answer in the next Your Mileage May Vary column?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s also important to note that there’s a difference between a physical disease like cancer, which is straightforwardly and universally negative, and a complex mental health condition like depression. For one thing, &lt;a href="https://ericturkheimer.substack.com/p/the-new-eugenics-companies"&gt;polygenic scores don’t perform as well in psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;, as psychologist Eric Turkheimer notes. Plus, most mental health conditions come in mild to moderate to severe forms, and it’s not clear that we should want to get rid of mild or moderate manifestations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Sure, it would be nice if no one ever got depressed, but what would that actually mean?” Turkheimer writes. “People are going to be sad, and the most modern models of psychiatric disorders view most of them as extremes on continuous dimensions of normal behavior. I don’t think we want some kind of genetic version of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_(Brave_New_World)"&gt;Soma&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;To give a personal example: I have generalized anxiety with some obsessive tendencies. Is that a major pain in the butt sometimes? You bet. But if I could wave a magic wand and get rid of it, would I? No. In my experience, this trait is linked to another trait I deeply value: my creativity. The same thing that propels me down rabbit holes of worry also propels me down rabbit holes of getting super curious about some topic, researching it into the wee hours of the morning, and then writing a novel or children’s book about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That brings me to one other scientific issue: pleiotropy. It’s a fancy term for a simple truth, which is that genes can have an effect on more than one trait. When it comes to behavioral polygenic testing, we actually know very little about which genes &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; what — a gene that’s correlated with depression or anxiety may also be correlated with a bunch of other things. So, if everyone were to start selecting embryos to try to protect their kids from depression or anxiety, what would happen? We don’t know!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Pleiotropy is a scientific issue, but it’s also a moral issue, because in trying to protect your kid from a negative outcome, you could also be accidentally barring them from a positive one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And that’s just the tip of the moral iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Another issue is the potential psychological harm that can result from commodifying our kids — treating them like consumer objects with selectable parts. Let’s say you use polygenic testing to try to select for high IQ. Even if the company’s predictor is right 80 percent of the time, that means it’s wrong 20 percent of the time. What happens if it’s wrong about your kid, and they end up with a low IQ instead of a high one? How will your kid feel? Unless you hide the truth from them, they’ll know that they are not what you wanted, that they failed to live up to the vision you went out of your way to chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The same goes for sex selection via good old PGT-A. I know you really want a girl. But what would happen if you select for a girl, and then your child grows up and turns out to be trans? They may feel an extra sense that they’re letting you down by not conforming to the gender expectations you had for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Then there are the ethical questions around unequal access. Polygenic testing isn’t cheap. (One company, Orchid, charges $2,500 per screened embryo. Test 10 embryos and that’ll cost you $25,000.) So, at least in the short term, that raises the specter of entrenching a caste system, where the gap between rich and poor expands dramatically as the rich get smarter and stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Technologies tend to get cheaper over time, so maybe everyone will ultimately be able to afford polygenic testing. But that raises another problem: implicit coercion. If more and more of us make ourselves smarter and stronger, we may create a society in which everyone feels pressure to alter their child’s biology — even if they don’t want to. To refuse embryo selection would mean to put a child at a huge professional disadvantage, or to face moral condemnation for making “suboptimal” kids when optimization is possible. Society may no longer offer health insurance benefits or accommodations for kids with disabilities (or even non-enhanced IQ), reasoning that “it was the parents’ choice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some philosophers, like Julian Savalescu, already argue that parents have a “&lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/12965784/The_Moral_Obligation_to_Create_Children_with_the_Best_Chance_of_the_Best_Life"&gt;moral obligation to create children with the best chance of the best life&lt;/a&gt;.” Polygenic testing companies love that argument; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/07/opinion/genetics-children-noor-siddiqui.html?unlocked_article_code=1.ck8.Z7vW.lKisTb4ZhtKn&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;Orchid founder Noor Siddiqui tells parents&lt;/a&gt; that “the responsible decision” is to “protect their children” from disease, using language like, “What if you could have stopped it...but chose not to?” And we generally live in a &lt;a href="/the-highlight/387570/moral-optimization"&gt;culture that’s obsessed with optimization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So it’s no wonder that you find yourself asking, “If I could do something to make my baby healthier and happier, don’t I kind of have to do everything in my power?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s a view that will be very appealing to utilitarians, who believe the right action is the action that &lt;em&gt;maximizes&lt;/em&gt; well-being or happiness. But maximizing principles can be dangerous. If we’re laser-focused on maximizing one value, however noble it may be, that can lead us to overlook a host of other important values. Think about diversity, for example; polygenic testing could lead to a less diverse world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And it’s not even clear how to maximize well-being given that each embryo will have some downsides: How would you choose between one embryo with a slightly elevated risk for schizophrenia, another with a moderately elevated risk for cancer, and a third with a high risk for Alzheimer’s? You’d have to decide how to rank the importance of each condition, which would require a dizzying bit of moral math: How much weight do you put on the longevity associated with each condition, how much on patient-reported quality of life for each condition, and how much on your own ability to cope with each — and society’s ability (which will change over the years)? Plus, even if the screening does end up optimizing life for your individual child, it could have negative effects on the population level, for the reasons we covered above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As Nobel laureate Herbert Simon pointed out, many problems contain way more variables and way too much uncertainty for maximizing along a single axis to be feasible or even desirable. So it often makes sense to just go with an option that’s “good enough.” He coined the term “satisficing” — a portmanteau of “satisfying” and “sufficing” — to describe opting for this good enough choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What would satisficing look like in the context of embryos? If there’s a very serious condition that runs in your family — like Tay-Sachs or the BRCA mutation that markedly increases cancer risk — then I do think there’s a strong case for screening for that. These conditions are debilitating and can lead to early death. Nobody wants them. Genetic testing that lets us prevent them is an awesome gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Then there are conditions that can include suffering, like autism, but can also be very compatible with a happy life. Mental health conditions in particular are heavily socially constructed — a lot of the associated suffering comes about because society constructs a certain biological reality as a problem and doesn’t support the people who have it. In these cases, if you want to give your child a “good enough” or even “optimized” life, remember that you don’t have to achieve that by biological means; working to change the social environment can be just as important, and it doesn’t carry the societal risks associated with polygenic testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Ultimately, when considering what counts as a “good enough” life, each parent will draw the line in a slightly different place. And there’s a part of that that can’t be boiled down to objective facts about disease, because this is also about how well-resourced the parent feels — emotionally, socially, and financially — to deal with a certain condition. What feels manageable to one parent may feel crushingly hard to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So, I can’t tell you exactly which screenings to do and which to forgo. What I do want to tell you is to resist being bullied or shamed by others, especially those with a profit incentive to push you in a certain direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As the epidemiologist Abby Lippman has noted, &lt;a href="https://web.ntpu.edu.tw/~markliu/prenatal_genetic_testing.pdf"&gt;genetic testing is supposed to offer parents&lt;/a&gt; more choice, but it too often has the opposite effect. When someone like Orchid’s Siddiqui says about a disease, “What if you could have stopped it...but chose not to?” — well, that language preys on parents’ worst fears and insecurities. It holds parents hostage while pretending to be giving them more autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;You are nobody’s hostage. You are a moral agent free to look at the many different relevant factors, weigh them all in the balance, and then make the choice that works well enough for your family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Silicon Valley is obsessed with IQ, so it’s no surprise that tech execs there are using polygenic testing in hopes of creating supersmart babies. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/silicon-valley-high-iq-children-764234f8?mod=hp_lead_pos9"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; shows the kind of mental pretzels customers get into when trying to figure out whether to select the embryo with the highest predicted IQ or that with the lowest risk of disorders.

It’s just that Down syndrome was easy to test for, so we started testing for it early. I wonder if that built up the condition as a bogeyman in the expectant parent’s imagination — if the fact that we &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;screen for it shaped the public’s perception of Down syndrome as something that &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be screened for and potentially screened out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;One trait that many people assume we should select for is a great memory.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She continued, “Veggies before meals, 9 on 10. This will help slow down the absorption of glucose and not cause a sugar spike. Late dinners, 1 on 10. This can cause a sugar spike, also increasing your cortisol level. Walking after meals, 10 on 10, will help reduce sugar spikes by 30%. So share this with all the people who have diabetes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="osv-ad-class"&gt;
					&lt;p class="ie-adtext"&gt;Story continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p id="gpt_ad_IE_ROS_ATF_1X1" class="ad-slot"&gt;
					&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While her breakdown provides a quick reference for those looking to adjust their eating habits and daily routine, it also sparks questions about the science behind these ratings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fruits on an empty stomach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kanikka Malhotra, a certified diabetes educator, tells &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a rel="noamphtml" class="keywordtourl" href="https://indianexpress.com"&gt;indianexpress.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, “For people with diabetes, eating fruit on an empty stomach can cause sharper blood sugar rises, mainly because fruit sugars absorb quickly when nothing slows them down. However, fruit is an important part of a healthy diet and need not be feared. The key is pairing fruit with protein or healthy fats, which helps your body absorb sugars more gradually. Choose whole, fibre-rich fruits like berries, apples, or pears, and regulate portions. Avoid fruit juices and canned fruits in syrup as they spike sugar rapidly. Remember, managing diabetes isn’t about avoiding fruit, but eating it wisely and as part of a balanced meal.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fat first, empty stomach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Malhotra states, “Scientifically speaking, fat delays gastric emptying, which can blunt the initial blood sugar spike after a meal. However, high-fat meals lead to delayed, prolonged rises in blood sugar and increased insulin needs, especially in people with type 1 diabetes. This is partly because free fatty acids from fat cause insulin resistance and stimulate hepatic glucose production over several hours. There is also risk of excess calorie intake and worsening cardiovascular health with too much saturated fat.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thus, “fat first” is not a universal fix. The safest, evidence-based approach is a balanced meal with healthy fats, fiber, and lean protein instead of isolated fat consumption. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="adboxtop adsizes"&gt;&lt;p class="ie-adtext"&gt;Story continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gpt_ad_IE_ROS_ROTATE_1_300X250" class="ad-slot "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;On walking after meals &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Taking a simple walk after eating is one of the most effective and practical tools to manage blood sugar. Malhotra explains that &lt;a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health-specials/post-meal-walk-blood-sugar-study-8074135/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;walking for just 10 minutes after a meal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can significantly reduce post-meal glucose spikes and help maintain better long-term control. Even shorter walks, of 2-5 minutes, are valuable if done consistently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Veggies before meals vs late dinners&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Malhotra confirms that eating non-starchy veggies—like salad or sautéed greens—before the main part of a meal “is scientifically proven to tame post-meal sugar spikes.” Veggies provide fiber, which acts as a barrier and slows down how quickly sugars from the rest of the meal hit the bloodstream. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Late dinners, on the other hand, disturb the body’s clock. Insulin sensitivity drops at night, so late eating leads to higher sugar and cortisol levels overnight. Over time, this pattern increases the risk of poor control and complications. Choose early dinners and prioritise veggies for steadier blood sugars and overall metabolic health,” concludes Malhotra.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The device is compact enough to rest on a fingertip and is compatible with current tissue-engineering technology.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A newly developed 3D-printed device offers scientists the ability to build human tissue models with far greater precision and complexity. The tool, created by an interdisciplinary team at the &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;University of Washington&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;The University of Washington, based in Seattle, is a major public research university known for leadership in medicine, genomics, computer science, and climate science.

&lt;p&gt;Recent progress in 3D tissue engineering has already improved the speed and &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;accuracy&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;A measure of how close a result or measurement is to the true value.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;accuracy&lt;/span&gt; of building cell-based systems, giving biomedical researchers powerful new ways to design and test treatments for a wide range of diseases. A central aim of the field is to recreate laboratory environments that mimic the natural conditions cells experience inside the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common method involves suspending cells within a gel positioned between two freestanding posts. This setup has been used to grow tissues such as heart, lung, skin, and muscle. While effective at allowing cells to function in a life-like way, the approach has limitations: it is difficult to examine how multiple tissue types interact. Achieving finer control over the composition and arrangement of cells could make it possible to model complex conditions, including neuromuscular disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;STOMP enables patterned tissue environments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paper published in &lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt; details how the new platform lets scientists examine how cells respond to mechanical and physical cues, while creating distinct regions in a suspended tissue. The 3D-printed device is known as STOMP (Suspended Tissue Open Microfluidic Patterning).&lt;/p&gt;

The sections stained in red are bone. The tissue model was created by Dr. Priti Mulimani at the University of Washington Department of Oral Health Sciences, School of Dentistry. Credit: Dr. Priti Mulimani&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashleigh Theberge, UW professor of chemistry, and Nate Sniadecki, professor of mechanical engineering and interim codirector of the UW Medicine Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, led the scientific team. The group showed that their device can recreate biological interfaces like bone and ligament, or fibrotic and healthy heart tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first authors of the paper were Amanda Haack, a student in the School of Medicine’s medical scientist program and postdoctoral fellow in the Theberge Lab, and Lauren Brown, a Ph.D. student in chemistry. UW faculty members Cole DeForest, professor of chemical engineering and bioengineering, and Tracy Popowics, professor of oral biology in the School of Dentistry, are coauthors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Casting tissues with microfluidic precision&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STOMP builds on a tissue-engineering technique known as casting, which the researchers describe through the simple analogy of making Jell-O in a mold. In laboratory practice, the “gel” is a mixture of living and synthetic materials, placed into a supporting frame with a pipette rather than poured. STOMP takes this approach further by using capillary action—similar to the way water rises in a straw—to allow scientists to precisely position different cell types in chosen patterns, much like arranging fruit pieces evenly within Jell-O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate its potential, the team tested STOMP in two experiments: one examined the contractile behavior of engineered heart tissue in both diseased and healthy states, while the other recreated the ligament that secures a tooth within its bone socket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device itself is only the size of a fingertip. It attaches to a two-post platform originally designed by the Sniadecki Lab for measuring the contractile forces of heart cells. Within this small structure lies an open microfluidic channel equipped with geometric features that control both the spacing and arrangement of cell types, enabling the creation of distinct regions in suspended tissue—all without requiring extra tools or added complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Design features improve tissue versatility&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogel technology from the DeForest Research Group souped up STOMP with another design feature: degradable walls. Tissue engineers can break down the sides of the device and leave the tissues intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Normally when you put cells in a 3D gel,” Sniadecki said, “they will use their own contractile forces to pull everything together — which causes the tissue to shrink away from the walls of the mold. But not every cell is super strong, and not every biomaterial can get remodeled like that. So that kind of nonstick quality gave us more versatility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theberge is excited about how other teams will use STOMP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This method opens new possibilities for tissue engineering and cell signaling research,” she said. “It was a true team effort of multiple groups working across disciplines.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a saying in medicine: Statins should be in the water. While this may be hyperbolic, as a cardiologist, I don’t think it’s too far from the truth. Despite being around for a generation, statins — a specific class of drugs used to lower cholesterol levels — remain among our strongest tools for reducing a person’s risk for experiencing a life-altering heart attack and stroke. Many Americans with risk factors for heart disease should be taking them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet far too few actually do. Although the reasons for this are undoubtedly complex, I think the time has come to take a different, more simplified approach. Statins are safe, effective, and cheap. They should be available over the counter.&lt;/p&gt;

Nitric oxide is a key molecule in vascular health as it promotes the vessels to dilate and thus reduces blood pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-author Andy Jones, a professor at the University of Exeter, said in a press release that the study shows that "&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/nutrition" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nitrate-rich foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nitrate-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; alter the oral microbiome in a way that could result in less inflammation, as well as a lowering of blood pressure in older people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Beniston, an associate director of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, said the "research is a great example of how bioscience can help us better understand the complex links &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/diet-trends" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:between diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;between diet&lt;/a&gt;, the microbiome and healthy aging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By uncovering how dietary nitrate affects oral bacteria and blood pressure in older adults, the study opens up new opportunities for improving vascular health through nutrition," Beniston added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;"As we age, our levels of bioavailable nitric oxide lower, so it makes sense that we see more of a benefit in consuming dietary nitrates in older patients."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both researchers shared that more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siegel noted that "as we age, our levels of bioavailable nitric oxide lower, so it makes sense that we see more of a benefit in consuming dietary nitrates in older patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the study does support the well-established belief that a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/diet-fitness" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:good diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;good diet&lt;/a&gt;, high in fresh fruits and vegetables, can help manage many chronic medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with high blood pressure or other medical conditions should check with doctors or medical experts before making dietary changes.
