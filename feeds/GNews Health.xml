    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioo1bkc001w2cnngi25cluh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;shingles vaccine&lt;/a&gt; not only offers protection against the painful viral infection, but a new study suggests that the two-dose shot also may slow the progression of dementia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000a3b6nc6g0yzj9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Shingles, caused by the varicella-zoster virus, presents as a painful rash and it’s estimated that about 1 in every 3 people in the United States will develop the illness in their lifetime. But the risk of shingles and serious complications increases with age, which is why in the United States, two doses of the shingles vaccine is recommended for adults 50 and older.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000b3b6nymgnmm26@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While vaccination is estimated to be more than 90% effective at preventing shingles in older adults, recent research has shed light on some other potential benefits too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000c3b6nzalbj2t5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Emerging research suggests that getting the vaccine to protect against shingles may &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/health/shingles-vaccines-dementia-studies"&gt;reduce the risk of developing dementia&lt;/a&gt;. A follow-up study, published Tuesday in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.11.007" target="_blank"&gt;the journal Cell&lt;/a&gt;, adds to that research by suggesting that the vaccine could also have therapeutic properties against dementia, by slowing the progression of the disease, leading to a reduced risk of dying from the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000d3b6n7cfarsjr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We see an effect on your probability of dying from dementia among those who already have dementia,” Dr. Pascal Geldsetzer, assistant professor of medicine at &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/pascal-geldsetzer" target="_blank"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; and senior author of the new study, said about the potential effects of the shingles vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000e3b6nrmpundx9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That means that the vaccine doesn’t just have a preventive potential, but actually a therapeutic potential as a treatment, because we see some benefits already among those who have dementia,” he said. “To me, this was really exciting to see and unexpected.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000g3b6nngfrr3dp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study comes just months after Geldsetzer and his colleagues previously found evidence that shingles vaccination may offer a “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank"&gt;dementia-preventing&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank"&gt;dementia-delaying&lt;/a&gt;” effect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000h3b6nx972rp0n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In that previous study, the researchers analyzed the health records of older adults in Wales, where a &lt;a href="https://phw.nhs.wales/topics/immunisation-and-vaccines/vaccines-professionals/shingles-information-for-health-professionals/" target="_blank"&gt;shingles vaccination program&lt;/a&gt; for adults in their 70s was introduced on September 1, 2013. The program indicated that anyone who was 79 on that date was eligible for the vaccine for one year, but those who were 80 or older were not eligible for the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000i3b6nqe9c7u5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those eligibility requirements allowed the researchers to examine data on the adults who were 79 and got vaccinated and then compare that data with the adults who were 80 and not eligible for vaccination but may have gotten the vaccine if they could.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000j3b6nn0nhzn61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are comparing groups of patients whose only difference is a tiny difference in age, just like a week or so, and they have this massive difference in the probability of ever getting vaccinated because of these unique eligibility rules,” Geldsetzer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000k3b6ntvo6zi6q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among those adults in Wales, the researchers found that receiving the shingles vaccine reduced the probability of being newly diagnosed with dementia by 3.5 percentage points over a seven-year period, compared with not receiving the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000l3b6nojrvxxd7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know they should have similar physical activity level, diets, et cetera,” Geldsetzer said. “So, we’re much more confident that what we’re actually looking at here is cause and effect, rather than just correlation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000n3b6n92jh3b1x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, in the new follow-up study, the same researchers analyzed the same data set of the adults in Wales, which included more than 282,500 adults. But this time, the researchers examined differences in the occurrence of mild cognitive impairment diagnoses and, among people already living with dementia, differences in the incidence of deaths due to dementia, while comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000o3b6neu0injcn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The key strength of our natural experiments is that these comparison groups should be similar in all characteristics except for a minute difference in age,” the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000p3b6nmoy7c0us@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To strengthen their findings, the researchers also analyzed similar health records in Australia, which has a similar shingles vaccination program as Wales.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000q3b6nes9cs94f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers found that among older adults without any record of cognitive impairment prior to getting vaccinated, among those who received the shingles vaccine saw a reduction of 3.1 percentage points in their risk of being newly diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment over a nine-year period compared with those who did not receive the vaccine. And the protective effects appeared to be stronger among women than men, which was also found in the previous study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000r3b6n5lm5u4xi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, among older adults already living with dementia, the researchers found that those who received the shingles vaccine saw a drop of 29.5 percentage points in their risk of dying due to the disease over a nine-year period compared with those who did not get vaccinated – suggesting that the vaccine may play a role in slowing the progression of dementia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000s3b6neo4f6v1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It seems to have these strong benefits across the entire disease course,” Geldsetzer said about the shingles vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000u3b6n1in6tgnw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the new study turned a spotlight on the possible relationship between shingles vaccination and dementia outcomes, it did not specifically uncover why the vaccine may have these potential effects. But Geldsetzer had some theories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000v3b6nwisghwed@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Broadly speaking, you can think about two mechanisms,” Geldsetzer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000w3b6n1z1cilra@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For one, the &lt;a href="https://www.nyp.org/patients-and-visitors/advances-consumers/issues/understanding-the-connection-between-chickenpox-and-shingles" target="_blank"&gt;same virus that causes shingles&lt;/a&gt; also causes chickenpox. After someone has chickenpox in childhood, the virus remains dormant in the nervous system and people get shingles when the virus reactivates in their bodies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000x3b6nsk7d8rwd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But even while the virus is hibernating in the nervous system, “this causes a constant interplay with the immune system,” Geldsetzer said. “We know this causes inflammation in the nervous system, and we know inflammation is a key process in so many chronic diseases, including dementia. So, it makes sense that reducing these reactivations through shingles vaccination may have benefits for the dementia disease process.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000y3b6nvb7q4i38@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The second possible mechanism, Geldsetzer said, is that the vaccine can provide a big boost to the immune system overall, strengthening it as a whole to fight off infections. And there is a growing body of research linking various &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/possible-risks-of-dementia/infections#?c" target="_blank"&gt;infections to increased dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;, so being better fit to fight off any infection could help with lowering dementia risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000z3b6nt5n2c6wx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s increasing evidence that vaccines have broader effects on the immune system, beyond just the specific antibody response that it has been designed to elicit,” Geldsetzer said. “These kinds of broader immune system activations may well have benefits for dementia disease development as well, and we know the immune system plays a key role in dementia. So that’s the other mechanism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr00103b6nfsuqocgl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Geldsetzer said that, as a next step, he and his colleagues plan to raise funding to “conclusively test” this link between shingles vaccination and reduced dementia risks in a randomized clinical trial.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioo1d1400003b6np2m6c2sz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, the new study shows that the shingles vaccine protects cognition from early to late stages of dementia, Dr. Angelina Sutin, professor of behavioral sciences and social medicine at Florida State University College of Medicine, who was not involved in the study, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiop8ob000163b6nvpbaxiwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When people find out that I study dementia, they often ask what I recommend to keep the brain healthy with age. I always respond with three things: exercise, be social, and do things you enjoy that make you feel purposeful. Now, I will add talk to your doctor about getting the shingles vaccine. There is no guarantee that doing these things means you will not get dementia, but all are relatively easy and accessible and help maintain healthy cognition for longer,” Sutin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiop8ob000173b6ns9ed48zq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But she added that what exactly may be driving this relationship between the shingles vaccine and reduced dementia risks remains a mystery.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiop8ob000183b6ntr5ivrqe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is still unknown. This study is a very important advance in understanding because it provides the closest to causal evidence for the shingles vaccine that is possible. Unfortunately, it does not directly answer the why,” she said. “This research sets a strong foundation for future research to find out why it is so protective.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmios0rbb00063b6nlce3f280@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Joel Salinas, a neurologist at NYU Langone, notes an important caveat about the study: the findings may not generalize to a newer vaccine that is now widely used.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmios1vjz00093b6npsojctqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would view these results as promising, providing unique evidence that shingles vaccination may have meaningful cognitive benefits, but not yet as definitive proof that we should vaccinate solely for dementia risk reduction,” Salinas said. “It’s reasonable to frame the connection as biologically plausible and increasingly well-supported by high-quality epidemiologic data, but still in need of mechanistic studies and replication before we can say definitively why shingles vaccination appears to be associated with lower dementia risk.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNN</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 16:16:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQNG5IaEFQajhWVTlBWURQMkdJNW1oSDJKT1JyMVE4Q21jS1FVaGRzWEJyOXdweVJPWDdtRkxySWFUUERHWUtVanhtaGJtSDVuMkN1ZF9veWRzOUpQZnRqa0VLVnB1LTNIMDYxaVdrWjJUMVBnM0tZRFJWcllPMXBfb2NWZkJfZThfY0NyQmtIZDJDRko3</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，患病的小蚂蚁要求它们的巢友用酸毒害它们以保护蚁群- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/diseased-baby-ants-ask-their-nestmates-to-poison-them-with-acid-to-protect-the-colony-study-finds-raised_hands-1-2000694317</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;New research shows that terminally ill baby ants tell other ants to kill them, potentially protecting the rest of the colony from their infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-66175-z"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published today in the journal Nature Communications, researchers revealed that ant pupae—what a larva grows into before becoming an adult—of the &lt;em&gt;Lasius neglectus&lt;/em&gt; ant species actively produce a chemical signal that causes other colony members to destroy them. The findings further solidify the view of an ant colony as a “superorganism” behaving as a single entity rather than a community of many individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Selfless ants&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sick individuals often conceal their disease status to group members, thereby preventing social exclusion or aggression,” the researchers wrote in the paper. On the other hand, researchers have documented sick adult ants leaving their colony to avoid spreading their disease. Pupae, however, are encased in a cocoon and cannot leave, so they resort to a rather extreme strategy&lt;span&gt;—emitting a chemical signal essentially calling for self-destruction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Adult ants that approach death leave the nest to die outside the colony. Similarly, workers that have been exposed to fungal spores practice social distancing,” Sylvia Cremer, co-author of the study and group leader of the Cremer Group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), said in an ISTA statement. “Yet, this is only possible for mobile individuals. Ant brood within the colony, like infected cells in tissue, are largely immobile and lack this option.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Once worker ants receive the signal, they take the pupae from the cocoon, punch holes into them, and inject them with formic acid—an antimicrobial poison that works like a self-produced disinfectant. This kills the pathogens but also the pupae.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While previous research had demonstrated that worker ants can recognize sick pupae and kill them to disinfect the nest, scientists didn’t know if passive cues or intentional signaling by the sick pupae triggered this dynamic. To shed light on the matter, the scientists behind the new study infected &lt;em&gt;Lasius neglectus&lt;/em&gt; ants with a fungal pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;BO as a warning&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the experiment, sick worker pupae emitted a modified body smell (the chemical signal) that warned the adult ants to destroy them. Only sick ants near adult worker ants produced this signal, indicating that the cue isn’t just an immune response or side effect of infection. When the researchers applied the smell to healthy pupae, they were also destroyed, confirming the chemical’s role in triggering the response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because workers destroy specific pupae within an entire &lt;a href="https://www.ant-shack.com/blogs/ant-articles/the-importance-of-ant-brood-care-nurturing-the-next-generation?srsltid=AfmBOoo4t6Bay3EDJJ1SxrfgpZqKO7xebay3dzSlKkr_Ad2-yM-UqotB"&gt;brood&lt;/a&gt; (eggs, larvae, and pupae) pile, “the scent cannot simply diffuse through the nest chamber but must be directly associated with the diseased pupa,” explained Thomas Schmitt, co-author of the study and a chemical ecologist from the University of Würzburg. “Accordingly, the signal does not consist of volatile compounds but instead is made up of non-volatile compounds on the pupal body surface.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While colonies are technically communities made of many individual ants, they work as a single superorganism. Ants within a colony are like the cells in our body. For example, ant queens are responsible for producing offspring, and non-fertile workers are responsible for the colony’s maintenance and health. Similarly, our germline cells are responsible for the production of offspring, and our somatic cells execute all the other important tasks. Along those same lines, the signaling from terminally ill pupae mirrors the way our body’s cells release chemical cues—called the “find-me and eat-me signal”—for our immune cells, which then identify and destroy the signaling cells to eliminate the risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Queen ants don’t need to be destroyed&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For ants, “what appears to be self-sacrifice at first glance is, in fact, also beneficial to the signaler: it safeguards its nestmates, with whom it shares many genes. By warning the colony of their deadly infection, terminally ill ants help the colony remain healthy and produce daughter colonies, which indirectly pass on the signaler’s genes to the next generation,” explained Erika Dawson, first author of the study and a behavioral ecologist at ISTA. If a terminally ill ant pretended to be healthy and died, it could become infectious and endanger the whole colony.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers did not observe queen pupae emit the chemical signal. They have stronger immune defenses than worker pupae and can restrict the infection independently. Worker pupae, however, couldn’t control the infection and warned the colony.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sick pupae only emit the signal when the infection is uncontrollable, empowering fellow ants to intervene in situations of real threats while avoiding the destruction of pupae that can recover. “This precise coordination between the individual and colony level is what makes this altruistic disease signaling so effective,” Cremer concluded.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Millions of people lose their lives each year due to heart-related conditions, often because the early warning signs are unnoticed or ignored. Dr Sanjay Bhojraj, a board-certified cardiologist and functional medicine specialist with over 20 years of experience, highlights the importance of recognising subtle changes in blood pressure as early indicators of heart disease. According to him, these changes can predict heart attacks up to a decade before typical symptoms such as chest pain or fatigue appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large real-world &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.122.028762" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;examined the long-term cardiovascular risk linked to Stage 1 Hypertension in over 96,000 individuals, with blood pressure measured in 2006 and 2010. The research aimed to estimate both 10-year and lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to understand how changes in blood pressure over time affect future risk. Results showed that people with Stage 1 Hypertension had a 35 % higher 10-year risk and a 36 % higher lifetime risk of CVD compared to those with normal blood pressure. Progression to more severe hypertension increased the 10-year risk by over 150 %. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection and management are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Silent Heart Attack Symptoms Women Often Miss | Spot the Warning Before It’s Too Late | Dr Rajeev Agrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early &lt;keyword id="24457019" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="blood-pressure-changes" source="keywords"&gt;blood pressure changes&lt;/keyword&gt; reveal heart stress years before symptoms&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to common belief, heart attacks are rarely completely sudden. The body often gives subtle signals long before a cardiac event occurs. Many of these signals are related to blood pressure, which reflects the condition of the heart and arteries. Slight, gradual changes in blood pressure over time may indicate that the cardiovascular system is under strain, even if overall readings appear normal during routine check-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Bhojraj explains, “In the past, I treated patients only after they experienced symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest discomfort, or fatigue. By that stage, their cardiovascular system had been under stress for years without anyone noticing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does stage 1 hypertension predict 10-year heart disease risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research and clinical experience show that certain patterns in blood pressure can act as early predictors of heart attacks. Dr Bhojraj identifies four key indicators that should not be ignored:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtle blood pressure variability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even minor fluctuations in blood pressure across days or weeks can signal that the heart is working harder than normal. These variations may not trigger symptoms but can indicate early vascular ageing and increased cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning blood pressure surges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure often rises naturally in the morning, but excessive or sharp morning surges are linked to a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. Monitoring morning readings can reveal patterns that indicate the cardiovascular system is under stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy blood pressure pattern includes a natural dip during sleep. If blood pressure remains elevated at night, it may indicate autonomic dysfunction or early arterial damage, which are significant risk factors for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of autonomic flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The autonomic nervous system controls blood pressure, heart rate, and other essential functions. A decline in its flexibility to adapt to stress or environmental changes may be an early sign of cardiovascular ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Bhojraj stresses that recognising these patterns requires consistent monitoring over time rather than relying on single measurements at the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Role of &lt;keyword id="31229210" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="early-blood-pressure-monitoring" source="keywords"&gt;early blood pressure monitoring&lt;/keyword&gt; in heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pivotal moment in Dr Bhojraj’s career occurred when a patient suffered a sudden heart attack despite having normal cholesterol levels and a stable weight. Upon reviewing the patient’s history, he discovered that subtle blood pressure changes had been occurring for nearly a decade. This case demonstrated that heart disease is often not sudden but develops gradually, and early intervention is possible if risk factors are detected early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following this realisation, Dr Bhojraj shifted his approach from reactive treatment to proactive prevention. He began analysing long-term blood pressure patterns while considering lifestyle factors such as sleep, stress, hormonal balance, and inflammation. This method allows him to identify patients at risk long before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of addressing early blood pressure changes for heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By addressing early blood pressure changes, patients can significantly reduce their risk of heart attacks and improve overall health. Key benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased energy levels and vitality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved metabolic health and weight management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhanced resilience to physical and mental stress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced cardiovascular age and stronger heart function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Bhojraj emphasises, “Prevention should not be a guessing game. Understanding your cardiovascular future early allows for meaningful changes that protect the heart and improve quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Monitoring blood pressure effectively&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular home monitoring is essential for detecting early warning signs. Automated blood pressure monitors can track readings over time, and maintaining a detailed record allows patients and doctors to observe subtle trends. Dr Bhojraj also recommends considering lifestyle factors such as sleep quality, diet, stress levels, and physical activity, as these directly impact blood pressure patterns and long-term heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

    &lt;p&gt;Twenty-one children are among 33 people who have died in Cuba of the mosquito-borne chikungunya and dengue viruses since July, authorities said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the deaths were attributed to chikungunya — characterized by fever and joint pain that can be debilitating but rarely fatal — while the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-dengue-fever-virus-symptoms-vaccine-treatment/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;flu-like dengue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; claimed 12 lives, the country's deputy health minister Carilda Pena said on state TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chikungunya virus emerged in Cuba's western Matanzas province in July, but soon spread to all 15 provinces of the country of 9.7 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chikungunya virus was first identified in Africa in the early 1950s. Chikungunya's symptoms include severe joint aches, fever, and fatigue, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Symptoms usually start within three to seven days after a bite from an infected mosquito, the CDC says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people recover within a week, according to the agency, though some experience severe joint pain for months or even years after their illness. Deaths are rare, the CDC says. Newborns infected around the time of birth, people over 65, and people with preexisting medical conditions are most likely to experience severe illness, the CDC says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the communist island has been afflicted by an outbreak of dengue that hit as Cuba battles shortages of clean water, food, fuel and medicine during its worst economic crisis in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuba, long known for its medical and pharmaceutical expertise, was able to deal a swift blow to a previous chikungunya outbreak in 2014. There is no specific treatment for the disease, but vaccines are available and recommended for people visiting an area experiencing an outbreak, the CDC says. The disease can't be spread from person to person.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, the one-party state reports, the outbreak spiraled out of control due to "lack of hygiene, accumulated garbage" and people storing water in tanks to mitigate the intermittent availability of clean tap water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the country under U.S. sanctions and its critical tourism sector left in ruins by Covid, a dearth of foreign currency has seen a steep decline in Cuba's medical services and prevention programs such as mosquito fumigation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Between Halloween candy, Thanksgiving pies and holiday cookies, the end of the year is often packed with opportunities to consume sugar. But what happens in your mouth during those first minutes and hours after eating those sweets? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you’re likely aware that eating too much sugar &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sugars-and-dental-caries"&gt;can cause cavities&lt;/a&gt; – that is, damage to your teeth – you might be less familiar with how bacteria use those sugars to build a sticky film called plaque on your teeth as soon as you take that first sweet bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=AiaIuhoAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;We are a team of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tHlHSigAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;microbiologists that studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://lemos-abranches.dental.ufl.edu/"&gt;how oral bacteria cause tooth decay&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s what happens in your mouth the moment sugar passes your lips – and how to protect your teeth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An acid plunge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within seconds of your first bite or sip of something sugary, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-023-00963-6"&gt;bacteria that make the human mouth their home&lt;/a&gt; start using those dietary sugars to grow and multiply. In the process of converting those sugars into energy, these bacteria &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3402/jom.v6.24878"&gt;produce large quantities of acids&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, just a minute or two after consuming  high-sugar foods or drinks, the acidity of your mouth increases into &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10266-012-0092-z"&gt;levels that can dissolve enamel&lt;/a&gt; – that is, the minerals making up the surface of your teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0003-9969(99)00119-3"&gt;saliva comes to the rescue&lt;/a&gt; before these acids can start corroding the surface of your teeth. It washes away excess sugars while also neutralizing the acids in your mouth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mouth is also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1040841X.2024.2389386"&gt;home to other bacteria that compete&lt;/a&gt; with cavity-causing bacteria for resources and space, fighting them off and restoring the acidity of your mouth to levels that aren’t harmful to teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, frequent consumption of sweets and sugary drinks can overfeed harmful bacteria in a way that neither saliva nor helpful bacteria can overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An assault on enamel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cavity-causing bacteria also use dietary sugars to make a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/unlocking-the-secrets-of-bacterial-biofilms-to-use-against-them-59148"&gt;sticky layer called a biofilm&lt;/a&gt; that acts like a fortress attached to the teeth. Biofilms are very hard to remove without mechanical force, such as from routinely brushing your teeth or cleaning at the dentist’s office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Microbes form vast communities called biofilms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, biofilms impose a physical barrier that restricts what crosses its border, such that saliva can no longer do its job of neutralizing acid as well. To make matters worse, while cavity-causing bacteria are able to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.2008/023770-0"&gt;survive in these acidic conditions&lt;/a&gt;, the good bacteria fighting them cannot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these protected fortresses, cavity-causing bacteria are able to keep multiplying, keeping the acidity level of the mouth elevated and leading to further loss of tooth minerals until a cavity becomes visible or painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to protect your (sweet) teeth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before eating your next sugary treat, there are a few measures you can take to help keep the cavity-forming bacteria at bay and your teeth safe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, try to reduce the amount of sugar you eat and consume your sugary food or drink during a meal. This way, the increased saliva production that occurs while eating can help wash away sugars and neutralize acids in your mouth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, avoid snacking on sweets and sugary drinks throughout the day, especially those containing table sugar or high-fructose corn syrup. Continually exposing your mouth to sugar will keep its acidity level higher for longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, remember to brush regularly, especially after meals, to remove as much dental plaque as possible. Daily flossing also helps remove plaque from areas that your toothbrush cannot reach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On the first Sunday after being named leader of the Catholic Church in May 2025, Pope Leo XIV stood on the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/zJUsFTxDOMk?si=qZvqqqi07SNl8uK5&amp;amp;t=2067"&gt;addressed the tens of thousands of people gathered&lt;/a&gt;. Invoking tradition, he led the people in noontime prayer. But rather than reciting it, as his predecessors generally did, he sang. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chanting the &lt;a href="https://www.usccb.org/prayers/regina-caeli"&gt;traditional Regina Caeli&lt;/a&gt;, the pope inspired &lt;a href="https://www.thecatholicthing.org/2025/08/18/pope-leo-xiv-inspires-a-rebirth-of-gregorian-chant/"&gt;what some have called a rebirth&lt;/a&gt; of Gregorian chant, a type of monophonic and unaccompanied singing done in Latin that dates back more than a thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vatican has been at the forefront of that push, launching an online initiative to teach Gregorian chant through short educational tutorials called “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRK0IuJlKq8&amp;amp;list=PL1-YYOFc-KJPLnuQ_0p6ZXnybb-RsCrah&amp;amp;index=2"&gt;Let’s Sing with the Pope&lt;/a&gt;.” The stated goals of the initiative are to give Catholics worldwide an opportunity to “participate actively in the liturgy” and to “make the rich heritage of Gregorian chant accessible to all.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These goals resonated with me. As &lt;a href="https://artsci.washu.edu/faculty-staff/elinor-harrison"&gt;a performing artist and scientist of human movement&lt;/a&gt;, I spent the past decade developing therapeutic techniques involving &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31986952/"&gt;singing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32878538/"&gt;dancing&lt;/a&gt; to help people with neurological disorders. Much like the pope’s initiative, these arts-based therapies require active participation, promote connection, and are accessible to anyone. Indeed, not only is singing a deeply ingrained human cultural activity, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35315920/"&gt;research increasingly shows how good it is for us&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The same old song and dance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 15 years, I worked as a professional dancer and singer. In the course of that career, I became convinced that creating art through movement and song was integral to my well-being. Eventually, I decided to shift gears and study the science underpinning my longtime passion by looking at the benefits of dance for people with Parkinson’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neurological condition, &lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/statistics"&gt;which affects over 10 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, is caused by neuron loss in an area of the brain that is involved in movement and rhythmic processing – the basal ganglia. The disease causes a range of debilitating motor impairments, including walking instability. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;A woman sings as part of a chorus for Parkinson’s patients and their care partners at a YMCA in Hanover, Mass., on Feb. 13, 2019.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/maureen-healy-of-scituate-sings-along-as-part-of-a-newly-news-photo/1127411734?adppopup=true"&gt;David L. Ryan/The Boston Globe via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on in my training, I suggested that people with Parkinson’s could improve the rhythm of their steps if they sang while they walked. Even as we began publishing our &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2017.02.008"&gt;initial feasibility studies&lt;/a&gt;, people remained skeptical. Wouldn’t it be too hard for people with motor impairment to do two things at once? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my own experience of singing and dancing simultaneously since I was a child suggested it could be innate. While Broadway performers do this at an extremely high level of artistry, singing and dancing are not limited to professionals. We teach children nursery rhymes with gestures; we spontaneously nod our heads to a favorite song; we sway to the beat while singing at a baseball game. Although people with Parkinson’s typically &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2012/918719"&gt;struggle to do two tasks at once&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps singing and moving were such natural activities that they could reinforce each other rather than distract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A scientific case for song&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are, in effect, hardwired to sing and dance, and we likely evolved to do so. In every known culture, evidence exists &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aax0868"&gt;of music, singing or chanting&lt;/a&gt;. The oldest discovered musical instruments are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08169"&gt;ivory and bone flutes&lt;/a&gt; dating back &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2012.03.003"&gt;over 40,000 years&lt;/a&gt;. Before people played music, they likely sang. The discovery of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.07.006"&gt;60,000-year-old hyoid bone&lt;/a&gt; shaped like a modern human’s suggests our Neanderthal ancestors could sing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In “&lt;a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2300"&gt;The Descent of Man&lt;/a&gt;,” Charles Darwin speculated that a musical protolanguage, analogous to birdsong, was driven by sexual selection. Whatever the reason, singing and chanting have been integral parts of spiritual, cultural and healing practices around the world for thousands of years. Chanting practices, in which repetitive sounds &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12111456"&gt;are used to induce altered states of consciousness&lt;/a&gt; and connect with the spiritual realm, are ancient and diverse in their roots. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the evolutionary reasons remain disputed, modern science is increasingly validating what many traditions have long held: Singing and chanting can have profound benefits to physical, mental and social health, with both immediate and long-term effects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physically, the act of producing sound can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjresp-2021-000996"&gt;strengthen the lungs and diaphragm and increase the amount of oxygen in the blood&lt;/a&gt;. Singing can also lower heart rate and blood pressure, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcm.2021.06.004"&gt;reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vocalizing can even improve your immune system, as active music participation &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jmt/39.1.30"&gt;can increase levels of immunoglobulin A&lt;/a&gt;, one of the body’s key antibodies to stave off illness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singing also improves mood and reduces stress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that singing lowers cortisol levels, the primary stress hormone, in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2016.631"&gt;healthy adults and people with cancer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2025.1569601"&gt;neurologic disorders&lt;/a&gt;. Singing may also rebalance autonomic nervous system activity by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/23268263.2024.2416265"&gt;stimulating the vagus nerve&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.727231"&gt;improving the body’s ability to respond to environmental stresses&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200518-why-singing-can-make-you-feel-better-in-lockdown"&gt;this is why singing has been called&lt;/a&gt; “the world’s most accessible stress reliever.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;A woman performs a Gregorian chant on Christmas Eve in 2023 in Spain.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/woman-performs-the-cant-de-la-sibil-la-during-the-midnight-news-photo/1880792059?adppopup=true"&gt;saac Buj/Europa Press via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, chanting may make you aware of your inner states while connecting to something larger. Repetitive chanting, as is common in rosary recitation and yogic mantras, can induce a meditative state, inducing mindfulness and altered states of consciousness. Neuroimaging &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-40200-w"&gt;studies show that chanting activates&lt;/a&gt; brainwaves associated with suspension of self-oriented and stress-related thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Singing as community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singing alone is one thing, but singing with others brings about a host of other benefits, as anyone who has sung in a choir can likely attest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group singing provides a mood boost and improves overall well-being. Increased levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin during singing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2021.105105"&gt;may promote feelings of social connection and bonding&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people sing in unison, they &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0024893"&gt;synchronize not just their breath but also their heart rates&lt;/a&gt;. Heart rate variability, a measure of the body’s adaptability to stress, also &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2020.00762/full"&gt;improves during group singing&lt;/a&gt;, whether you’re an expert or a novice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my own research, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-33942-6"&gt;singing has proven useful in yet another way&lt;/a&gt;: as a cue for movement. Matching footfalls to one’s own singing is an effective tool for improving walking that is better than passive listening. Seemingly, active vocalization requires a level of engagement, attention and effort that can translate into improved motor patterns. For people with Parkinson’s, for example, this simple activity can help them avoid a fall. We have shown that people with the disease, in spite of neural degeneration, activate &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40134419/"&gt;similar brain regions as healthy controls&lt;/a&gt;. And it works &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6744333/"&gt;even when you sing in your head&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you choose to sing with the pope or not, you don’t need a mellifluous voice like his to raise your voice in song. You can sing in the shower. Join a choir. Chant that “om” at the end of yoga class. Releasing your voice might be easier than you think. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, besides, it’s good for you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

What makes this even more startling, is that cancer is particulary tricky to treat, especially if it is diagnosed at a later stage, and is aggressive. While Cancer can eventually go into remission stage, (meaning that there are no current cancer traces in the body), it is also highly preventable, with the right diet, exercise, and lifestyle habits. Research indicates that specific lifestyle choices help people decrease their cancer risk through immune system enhancement, cell protection and inflammation reduction.

            &lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (VINnews) — This week we read in the Torah that a man [who was an ange] wrestled with Yaakov and “When he saw that he could not prevail against him, he touched the socket of his hip,” and Yaakov was left limping. For a young man in Maaleh Adumim, the pain in his hip nearly cost him his life, as reported by “Jerusalem Haredim”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong class="whatsapp-promotion-mobile"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nadav Menashe, a 23-year-old from Ma’ale Adumim, recently felt a series of intensifying pains in the pelvic area which brought his routine to a halt. At first, he was sure it was just overexertion, but as the pain became daily and increasingly severe, he sought medical evaluation. A doctor who suspected a slipped disc sent him for an MRI, and by chance, an image that “spilled over” slightly into the pelvic region revealed an unusual finding. Further testing at the hospital revealed that Nadav had a rare cancerous tumor threatening his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the shock, Nadav chose a mindset of faith and resilience. “It is disappointing, but I believe everything is from G-d and that everything is for the best,” he said. The doctors explained that the only way to save his life was through an especially complex surgery. Nadav decided to undergo the procedure at the Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center, led by Dr. Omer Or, head of the Orthopedic Oncology Unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surgery lasted about 15 hours and involved a multidisciplinary team using advanced technologies. Dr. Or noted that it was a rare procedure aimed at removing the tumor entirely while preserving future pelvic function. The surgical team used computer-guided navigation systems — a kind of “medical GPS” — and 3D-printed models for precise planning and resection. In a unique stage of the operation, a bone graft was taken from Nadav’s leg and implanted into his pelvis, allowing reconstruction of the bone structure and preservation of the hip joint and his ability to walk in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the lengthy surgery came the challenging rehabilitation phase. Nadav, who had been fully independent, found himself in a wheelchair and dependent on help for basic tasks. He transferred to the Gandel Rehabilitation Center at Hadassah Mount Scopus, where he learned again how to sit, stand, and later, walk. “The first time I managed to walk was amazing,” he recalled. “I suddenly realized it’s not just about walking, it’s about knowing you can trust your body again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, after an extended rehabilitation period and radiation treatments, Nadav walks with a cane and continues to progress with determination. He sums up his message simply and clearly: “I learned that nothing is to be taken for granted. Every day that you wake up and walk is a blessing. If something closes a door for you, it probably means another one was meant to open.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Whether poop speeds through your gut like a bullet train or takes a more smell-the-roses approach could have more profound implications for your overall health than a first glance would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2022-328166"&gt;a 2023 review&lt;/a&gt; that brought together data from dozens of studies, distinct differences can be seen between the gut microbiomes of '&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-well-is-your-gut-working-theres-a-grossly-simple-way-to-check"&gt;speeders' and 'slowpokes'&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the human gut microbiome is intrinsically linked to health, this could have implications that have gone unnoticed before now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, slow transit times and constipation have been linked with metabolic and inflammatory disorders, as well as neurological disorders such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/changes-in-gut-bacteria-are-present-long-before-signs-of-parkinsons-appear"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figuring out the microbiome profiles associated with these gut transit times could help develop new ways to treat and manage these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-poop-schedule-says-a-lot-about-your-overall-health-suggests-study"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Poop Schedule Says a Lot About Your Overall Health, Suggests Study&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By taking into account the interindividual and intraindividual differences in gut transit time, we can advance our understanding of diet–microbiota interactions and disease-related microbiome signatures," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2022-328166"&gt;writes a team&lt;/a&gt; led by nutritionists Nicola Procházková and Henrik Roager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Altogether, a better understanding of the complex, bidirectional interactions between the gut microbiota and transit time is required to better understand gut microbiome variations in health and disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183237" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183237" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Mans-hands-holding-a-roll-of-toilet-paper-642x361.jpg" alt="A man sitting on a toilet, fully clothed, holding a roll of toilet paper.

We also know that it can be shaped by a variety of mechanisms, from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lifting-weights-could-change-your-gut-microbiome-within-weeks"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/yo-yo-dieting-may-trigger-long-lasting-changes-in-gut-bacteria"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-contain-a-variety-of-microbiomes-heres-a-look-at-a-few-of-the-most-important"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Procházková and her colleagues wanted to know if we were overlooking a very simple thing that could affect gut microbes: how long they spend hanging out with poop before it makes its way to the wild &lt;a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/loo"&gt;loo&lt;/a&gt; yonder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tapped into previously published research on participants' gut transit time, including stool consistency (a proxy for transit time), diet, the composition of their microbiomes, and the metabolites produced by those microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-pooping-habits-could-harm-your-health-in-7-ways-research-shows"&gt;Your Pooping Habits Could Harm Your Health in 7 Ways, Research Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results incorporated studies that collectively had thousands of patients, both healthy people and people with conditions such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-irritable-bowel-syndrome-and-what-can-i-do-about-it"&gt;irritable bowel disease&lt;/a&gt;, constipation, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-daily-habits-could-be-causing-your-liver-serious-harm"&gt;liver cirrhosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding gut transit time isn't as simple as keeping a record of one's poop schedule. It can involve special swallowable capsules equipped with sensors that record their journey through the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another approach is the Bristol Stool Scale, a visual diagnostic tool that classifies poop based on consistency, from hard, rock-like pellets (long transit time) to a watery mush (short transit time). Some studies track how long it takes participants to pass ingested blue dye or sweet corn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All have the same goal: to estimate how long food stays in the colon. The longer the stay, the more time bacteria have to ferment the contents, regulate the gut's acidity, and produce metabolites that can influence the health of the body in multiple ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-signal-of-a-silent-killer-cancer-may-hide-in-your-poop"&gt;An Early Warning Signal of a 'Silent Killer' Cancer May Hide in Your Poop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the results of the team's analysis were fascinating. People with fast gut transit times had dramatically different microbiomes from people with slower transit times. Adding transit times to the patient data provided better predictions of gut microbiota than simply examining diet alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, those with faster gut transit times tended to have microbiomes dominated by faster-growing species that thrive on a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. Slower transit times, meanwhile, were sometimes dominated by species that thrive on protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these extremes also had lower gut microbiome diversity than people with average gut transit times, suggesting that fast and slow movement creates environments where specialist species come out on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would then create a feedback loop in which the dominant species in each environment releases metabolites that maintain the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the results suggest that gut transit time is an overlooked tool for understanding how the gut works, the role it plays in overall health, and how patients respond to treatments such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/probiotics-vs-prebiotics-whats-the-difference-and-do-you-need-both"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-most-expensive-coffee-is-chemically-different-because-its-literally-poop"&gt;World's Most Expensive Coffee Is Chemically Different Because It's Literally Poop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may also help explain why the same gut health advice may not work for everyone. Two people can eat the exact same meal and get two very different results, depending on how fast their poop usually moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transit times may even influence how your body responds to probiotics and certain supplements or medications that interact with the gut. This suggests that recognizing the individual gut rhythm of the patient could help tailor treatments and dietary advice that precisely matches their body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By including gut transit time measurements in gut microbiome-related studies, we can advance our understanding of the links between the gut microbiome, diet and disease," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2022-328166"&gt;the researchers write&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Such insights may be key for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of several diseases in the gut and beyond throughout the lifespan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in 2023 in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2022-328166"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gut&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

He decided to try quitting again, this time while taking semaglutide, the blockbuster GLP-1 drug better known as Ozempic. “That’s when he wrote to me,” says Grigson, who works at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine in Hershey. “He said that he was drug- and alcohol-free for the first time in his adult life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03074-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03911-x/d41586-025-03911-x_27707328.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Why do obesity drugs seem to treat so many other ailments?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories like this have been spreading fast in the past few years, through online forums, weight-loss clinics and news headlines. They describe people taking diabetes and weight-loss drugs such as semaglutide (also marketed as Wegovy) and tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro or Zepbound) who find themselves suddenly able to shake long-standing addictions to cigarettes, alcohol and other drugs. And now, clinical data are starting to back them up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a team led by Christian Hendershot, a psychologist now at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, reported in a landmark randomized trial that weekly injections of semaglutide cut alcohol consumption&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — a key demonstration that GLP-1 drugs can alter addictive behaviour in people with a substance-use disorder. More than a dozen randomized clinical studies testing GLP-1 drugs for addiction are now under way worldwide, with some results expected in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists, meanwhile, are working out how the weight-loss drugs suppress addiction by acting on hormone receptors in brain regions that control craving, reward and motivation. They are finding that GLP-1 therapies help to blunt urges for alcohol, opioids, nicotine and cocaine through some of the same brain pathways that also &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03766-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03766-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;quell hunger cues and overeating&lt;/a&gt;. “At the end of the day, the neurobiological system that is activated by rewarding substances — food, sex, drugs, rock and roll — it’s the same system,” says Roger McIntyre, a psychopharmacologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. And some researchers are testing whether, by influencing reward-related brain circuits, the drugs might help with dementia and depression as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01091-8" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03911-x/d41586-025-03911-x_27075824.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Obesity drugs aren’t always forever. What happens when you quit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is still in its early stages, scientists warn. “We first need to find out if it’s efficacious and safe,” says W. Kyle Simmons, a neuroimaging specialist at Oklahoma State University in Tulsa, who is leading a GLP-1 trial for alcohol reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some researchers and physicians are excited. No truly new class of addiction medicine has won approval from regulators in decades, says Elisabet Jerlhag Holm, an addiction biologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. If GLP-1 drugs prove effective in bigger trials, she says, “it’s a revolution”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Laboratory to limelight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took some years for the current buzz around GLP-1 drugs in addiction medicine to build. Researchers originally developed them to control blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes by mimicking the hormone GLP-1. Soon it became clear that the drugs could &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04505-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04505-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;curb appetite and promote weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, too. They act on hormone receptors located in the pancreas and gut — where they help to regulate blood sugar and signal fullness — but also in key regions of the brain that control reward and motivation, dialling down the urge for tasty, calorie-laden food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the early 2010s, Jerlhag Holm was wondering whether the drugs could blunt other urges. She published a trio of papers showing that they could dampen cravings in rats and mice hooked on alcohol&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, nicotine&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and stimulants such as amphetamine and cocaine&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Her team also showed&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that GLP-1 therapy could reduce animal behaviours that resemble relapse, which is when people return to drugs after a period of abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03911-x/d41586-025-03911-x_51762694.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03911-x/d41586-025-03911-x_51762694.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A man in a shirt standing in a doorway next to a no smoking sign, exhaling a large cloud of vapour." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03911-x/d41586-025-03911-x_51762694.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Some people report anecdotally that GLP-1 drugs are helping them to quit long-standing nicotine addictions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet her findings barely registered among addiction researchers, she says, and pharmaceutical companies showed no interest either. “I was quite alone for a long time,” says Jerlhag Holm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lorenzo Leggio, a physician-scientist at the US National Institutes of Health in Baltimore, Maryland, noticed the work. He had also been following clues that GLP-1 might influence addictive behaviour and, in 2015, joined forces with Jerlhag Holm to uncover the first evidence of a connection between the hormone and alcohol dependence in humans. The team found that a common variant of the GLP-1 receptor gene was linked to heavier drinking&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using post-mortem human brain tissue, Leggio’s lab later showed that people with alcohol-use disorder have elevated levels of GLP-1 receptors in key reward-related regions of the brain&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Leggio suspects that this reflects an adaptive response: alcohol dampens the body’s GLP-1 production, and so the brain boosts expression of the hormone’s receptors to preserve sensitivity to it in circuits that govern reward and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results, together with a growing number of animal studies, solidified GLP-1’s connection to addictive behaviour. Yet it was not until May 2023 that the story spilled into the public eye. &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt; magazine published an article about people taking semaglutide who said their urge to smoke or drink had faded. ‘Did Scientists Accidentally Invent an Anti-addiction Drug?’ it was headlined. “That was definitely a turning point,” says Leggio, who suddenly found himself getting calls from journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first few rigorous trials, however, had largely disappointing results. A 2022 study in Denmark, led by psychiatrist Anders Fink-Jensen at the University of Copenhagen, found that weekly treatment with exenatide — a ‘first-generation’ GLP-1 compound used since 2005 to treat diabetes but never approved for weight loss — did not substantially reduce the number of heavy drinking days in people diagnosed with alcohol dependence&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A 2023 trial in Switzerland likewise found that dulaglutide, another older GLP-1 drug, did not help people to quit smoking&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03766-2" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03911-x/d41586-025-03911-x_51777838.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How obesity drugs quiet ‘food noise’ in the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other results suggested that the drugs might have an effect. In a trial&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; involving 20 people with opioid-use disorder, led by Grigson and psychologist Scott Bunce, also at Pennsylvania State University, treatment with liraglutide — another first-generation GLP-1 drug — reduced opioid craving by roughly 40%. And when Fink-Jensen’s team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at the brains of people taking exenatide in their clinical trial, they saw muted activity in reward-related regions when the participants viewed images of alcoholic drinks&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the first-generation drugs tested in these preliminary studies are much less potent than agents such as semaglutide or tirzepatide. These second-generation compounds bind more tightly to the GLP-1 receptor, stay active in the body for longer and have shown greater benefits across a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03074-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03074-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;range of health conditions&lt;/a&gt;. So, could these latest drugs change the behaviour of people struggling with substance misuse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Blunting the buzz&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what researchers are now examining in a raft of clinical trials with hotly anticipated results. Fink-Jensen and his colleagues have already tested whether the high dose of semaglutide approved for weight loss can cut alcohol intake in 108 people with alcohol-use disorder and obesity, in a clinical trial that wrapped up earlier this year. He says the results should be published in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00404-9" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03911-x/d41586-025-03911-x_51069212.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Dozens of new obesity drugs are coming: these are the ones to watch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, meanwhile, Leggio and Simmons are each leading independent but coordinated randomized trials testing injected semaglutide in moderate-to-heavy drinkers who meet the diagnostic criteria for problematic alcohol use. Leggio’s trial will involve 52 people and test the high-dose Wegovy form of the drug, whereas Simmons’s trial, involving 80 people, is testing the lower-dose Ozempic, typically prescribed for diabetes. And psychologist Joseph Schacht at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora has been running his own alcohol trial with the oral version of semaglutide (marketed as Rybelsus). By coordinating their efforts, the three teams hope to tease apart how differences in dose and delivery affect outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schacht says that the pills, although less potent than injections, could be more appealing to people with alcohol addiction, many of whom also have a history of using injectable drugs such as fentanyl. “They can be gun-shy around needles, because that is a cue related to injection drug use,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all of these trials of semaglutide for alcohol dependence, the research teams are also using fMRI to capture before-and-after snapshots of the brain to show how the drug alters responses to alcohol-related prompts, such as drinks or photos. This could reveal whether and how the drug disrupts the brain’s drive for alcohol — the reward-seeking sense of ‘wanting’ that fuels addiction. The imaging results might also show brain activity patterns that are more common in people who benefit from GLP-1 therapy than in those who don’t. “It may give us a better understanding for whom the drug works best,” Simmons says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Anatomy of reward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are already piecing together a picture of how GLP-1 drugs act on the brain’s reward system. They know from animal models that rewarding substances — alcohol, nicotine, opioids, food — activate similar neural circuitry. This links deep brain structures such as the ventral tegmental area, where neurons that synthesize the neurotransmitter dopamine originate, to the nucleus accumbens, where dopamine signals arrive and register as pleasure. Normally, every sip, puff or hit sends a jolt of rewarding dopamine through this circuit, teaching the brain to want more and reinforcing addictive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 receptors sit on neurons throughout this network and, when triggered, are thought to reduce the flow of dopamine and other chemical messages to make rewarding experiences feel less compelling. When drugs such as semaglutide mimic GLP-1, they blunt the dopamine response and the compulsion to repeat the addictive behaviour fades away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress responses come into play as well, animal studies show. When drugs activate GLP-1 receptors in brain regions such as the amygdala, they help to mute the surge of stress hormones that accompany anxiety, withdrawal and craving. This dual action — calming both the urge and the unease — could help to explain why the therapies seem to reduce not only consumption but also relapse, at least in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

"With the recent COVID strains, Nimbus and Stratus, there was a &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/most-common-covid-symptom-june-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:razor blade throat symptom;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;razor blade throat symptom&lt;/a&gt;, which some people report very intense, sore throat and cough, dry, hacking cough. But overall, the symptoms of COVID, influenza and RSV can be very similar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that they can all cause fever, headache, cough and fatigue, but that "Influenza often causes more pronounced body aches, joint and bone pain that tend to be more severe and last longer than the common cold. RSV can attack the lungs and cause wheezing. But COVID can also cause these symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Photo by South&amp;amp;lowbar;agency on Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealth.uci.edu/faculty/boden-albala-dr-bernadette/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Bernadette Boden-Albala, MPH, DrPH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Bernadette Boden-Albala, MPH, DrPH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, founding dean of the UC Irvine Joe C. Wen School of Population &amp;amp; Public Health, agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on trends from the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control, we aren’t seeing new or unusual symptoms with the variants circulating now," she says. "Stratus and Nimbus, current COVID variants, largely mirror previous strains, with symptoms like fever, cough, congestion and fatigue still the most common. The one unique feature of the Nimbus variant is a pronounced 'razor blade' sore throat, which clinicians are reporting more frequently. Overall, this consistency in symptoms suggests we’re not seeing a significantly different strain emerging this flu/COVID season."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, a lot of the symptoms that seemed to be COVID hallmarks early in the pandemic aren't nearly as prevalent now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When COVID first appeared, we saw the lower respiratory tract manifestation of pneumonia. We don't see that anymore," Dr. Saggar says. "Current variants mainly cause upper respiratory tract infections. Also, the loss of the sense of taste (known as ageusia) or dysgeusia (metallic taste) was associated with early variants of COVID, but that is no longer the case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As time goes on and COVID infections become generally less serious, we see fewer cases of severe respiratory symptoms leading to hospitalization or death," Dr. Cutler said. "But this can occur as there were about 50,000 covid deaths in the country during the past year. To put this in perspective, this is about double the number of deaths from the flu. However, covid caused only about 1% of the total deaths which have occurred in the past year, making it the tenth most common cause of death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this is why testing is crucial if you feel sick, because treatments can vary for each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/surprising-covid-vaccine-side-effect-according-to-study-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Surprising COVID-19 Vaccine Side Effect No One Is Talking About;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Surprising COVID-19 Vaccine Side Effect No One Is Talking About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should You Get the COVID Booster?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors agree: Vaccination is your biggest safeguard against getting a severe case of COVID-19, as well as the flu. The &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; best time to have gotten vaccinated was yesterday, but there's still time!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The best time to get a COVID-19 vaccine or booster is now‚ before holiday gatherings and increased travel, especially by air," Dr. Boden-Albala says. "Vaccination offers safer and more predictable protection than infection, and it takes about two weeks for the immune system to build a strong response after a dose. Because protection is highest in the first few months, getting vaccinated ahead of the holidays ensures people enter peak flu/COVID season with optimal immunity to protect themselves, their loved ones, and the community."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, getting the COVID vaccine can also protect you from long COVID, which is no &lt;a href="https://parade.com/940979/kelseypelzer/best-dad-jokes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:joke;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;joke&lt;/a&gt;.

What now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First things first: Book an appointment with your physician or urgent care clinic if you can, so a medical professional can give you a proper diagnosis. If that's unfeasible, take an at-home PCR test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If and when you've confirmed a COVID diagnosis, talk to your doctor about your treatment options. You may be able to snag a prescription for Paxlovid, which can shorten your suffering through COVID symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll also want to stay hydrated, isolate from others and try to rest as much as you can. You can treat symptoms with over-the-counter medications. Depending on what your individual symptoms are, antihistamines, decongestants (you'll have to get these from the pharmacy counter), lozenges, cough syrup, pain relievers and fever reducers can go a long way to making you feel human again—but be sure to check with your doctor and/or pharmacist to make sure nothing you take will interact negatively with any other medications you may be taking or other conditions you may have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/covid-brain-aging-study-july-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: COVID Had a Startling Impact on Our Brains, New Research Says—Here’s What a Neurologist Wants You To Do;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: COVID Had a Startling Impact on Our Brains, New Research Says—Here’s What a Neurologist Wants You To Do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/most-common-covid-symptoms-december-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Dec 1, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Health &amp;amp; Wellness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Health &amp;amp; Wellness&lt;/a&gt; section.

Sounds like a simple yet effective plan towards better health, but is it really the secret everyone hopes for? or does it also come with drawbacks? Beetroot has gained popularity significantly in the past years, due to its ultimate benefits for every organ of the body such as heart, skin, hair and even our liver, but while this drink can increase stamina and maintain heart health, research highlights the real benefits from moderate daily intake, and to our surprise, it is not a magic bullet. Certain people need to skip it or limit it to avoid its side effects, as excess of everything is bad! Let's look at the evidence from studies and practical advice on making it work for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key benefits backed by science&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beetroot is a star when it comes to managing our heart health optimally, and its juice shines for blood pressure control. A component present in beetroot called Nitric oxide relaxes the blood vessels and improves blood flow in the body. A classic 2008 trial in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/hypertensionaha.107.103523" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Journal of Hypertension by AHA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;found that 500 ml of beetroot juice significantly lowered systolic blood pressure by 10.4mm Hg and diastolic by 8 mmHg in healthy adults within 24 hours and that effects lasted up to a day only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Study finds drinking beetroot juice promotes healthy ageing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of London led this work. More recent trials confirm it. A 2024 meta-analysis in Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases reviewed 43 studies on hypertensive patients. Daily beetroot juice reduced systolic pressure by 4.5 mmHg on average, with stronger effects in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1347242/full" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; review of 20 randomized trials showed beetroot juice improved time-to-exhaustion by 1.2 percent and power output in endurance events.

Start with half a glass mixed with water or apple juice to ease the earthy taste. Drink it fresh for max nitrates, or store in the fridge up to 24 hours. Timing matters too.

					&lt;p&gt;Ben-Gurion University of the Negev’s Prof. Alon Monsonego says he has discovered a set of immune cells that may hold the secret to prolonging longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The immune system deteriorates with time, and that process may dictate the pace of aging,” said Monsonego, 61, of Ben-Gurion’s Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics in the Faculty of Health Sciences. Monsonego, who is also affiliated with the school of Brain Sciences and Cognition, heads the university’s Neuroimmunology lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking with The Times of Israel via Zoom, Monsonego explained that as people age, senescent cells — cells that can no longer divide and cause inflammation — accumulate, leading to tissue damage and disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;However, Monsonego’s team discovered that certain lymphocytes, or white blood cells, known as cytotoxic T helper cells, can identify and destroy infected or cancerous cells within the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team didn’t realize the unique qualities of these T helper cells until a Japanese study showed that the immune systems of super-centenarians — people who live to be over 100 years old — were full of these cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Medical Holy Grail: Israeli researchers isolate elusive cells that may slow down aging"&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p class="newsletter-error newsletter-article-error"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;“We found these cytotoxic T helper cells can be very effective in reducing the burden of senescent cells, allowing tissues to regenerate and recover,” the researcher said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were published this month in the respected peer-reviewed journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00953-8"&gt;Nature Aging,&lt;/a&gt; in a paper led by Monsonego’s lab researcher Dr. Yehezqel Elyahu, in collaboration with Ben-Gurion’s Prof. Esti &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-team-uses-tool-that-finds-fake-online-profiles-to-detect-abnormal-protein-activity/"&gt;Yeger-Lotem&lt;/a&gt;, and Prof. Valery Krizhanovsky of the Weizmann Institute of Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We hope this research will lead to diagnostic tools and then therapy treatments to track and improve healthy aging,” Monsongego said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Emphasizing ‘health span’ and not ‘life span’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“About five years ago, we started looking at the differences between the lymphocytes of young and old mice,” Monsonego said. “We know that with aging, you get more inflammation and a less capable immune system. We were curious to know why.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained that these days, scientists talk less about life span — how long someone will live — and focus more on health span, which is how long a person remains healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientist pointed out that aging-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease often begin in the fourth decade of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you say ‘aging,’ people think of their seventies, but it actually starts much earlier,” he said. “If you want to preserve health span, you need to start early.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not enough to live to 90 with five different diseases,” Monsonego said. “We need to think about living healthy, not just living long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The importance of cytotoxic T helper cells&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsonego’s earlier work, published five years ago, helped define what he called a “roadmap” for how lymphocytes change with age.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;“No one ever did that before,” he said. “We were pioneers in identifying, in detail, the dynamic changes of cytotoxic T helper cells in aging mice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is when we realized the surprising and significant accumulation of these cells,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest experiment, the team generated genetically modified mice that did not have the cytotoxic T helper cells and compared them with mice that did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Without these cells, the mice lived shorter lives,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the researchers first identified these cells, they thought there was some kind of mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It surprised me, because I used to think that if you have something that appears late in life, it probably means something goes wrong,” Monsonego said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsonego said that he is now attempting to study the immune system of super-centenarians living in Blue Zones, areas around the world where the population has a life expectancy much higher than the global average, since “our study suggests that the immune system of healthy older individuals may have properties which we weren’t aware of before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these super-centenarians, it’s not only a matter of “extremely good genes,” Monsonego said. “For most of us, it depends on how we live. Increasing your lifespan means being aware that you need to work hard at it. You need to make sure that you have a good diet and exercise. People need to change their lifestyle early enough, before they develop a chronic disease. Medicine alone can’t do magic.”&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;Asya Rolls, professor of neuroscience at Tel Aviv University’s School of Neurobiology, Biochemistry and Biophysics, who was unconnected to the study, told The Times of Israel that Monsonego’s research on the discovery of these T Helper cells suggests that “aging might be more controllable than we thought.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Strengthening this natural immune mechanism could eventually open new ways to slow down age-related decline and keep tissues healthier for longer,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsonego said that his lab is continuing the research to see how these cells can slow down age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s the goal,” he said. “To develop a diagnostic tool that can identify the changes in the T helper cells, and then, of course, to follow it with therapeutic strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A combination of obesity and low levels of the nutrient &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choline"&gt;choline&lt;/a&gt; could contribute to accelerated brain aging and potentially some early triggers of neurodegenerative diseases such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="183784" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choline is well established as one of the most vital nutrients for a healthy body, so a lack of it, together with stresses associated with obesity, might act as warning signs for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-speech-trait-that-foreshadows-cognitive-decline"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; long before actual symptoms appear, according to researchers led by a team from Arizona State University (ASU).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This research adds to the growing evidence that choline is a valuable marker of metabolic and brain dysfunction – and reinforces the importance of sufficient daily intake, as it is essential for human health," &lt;a href="https://news.asu.edu/20251125-health-and-medicine-surprising-connection-between-obesity-choline-and-brain-inflammation"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurobiologist Ramon Velazquez, from ASU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/speaking-multiple-languages-may-slow-brain-aging-study-suggests"&gt;Speaking Multiple Languages May Slow Brain Aging, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Several new reports published this month further link reduced blood choline levels to behavioral changes, including anxiety and memory impairment, as well as broader metabolic dysfunction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 15 people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/to-tackle-our-obesity-crisis-experts-say-everything-we-do-must-change"&gt;with obesity&lt;/a&gt; with an average age of 33.6, matching them against 15 healthy controls, before analyzing key chemical levels and biomarkers in the systems of all participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183787" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183787" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/ObesityWheel.jpg" alt="Obesity study findings" class="wp-image-183787 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/ObesityWheel.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/ObesityWheel-600x604.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183787" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Obesity was linked to a variety of other biomarkers.

That variant emerged after this season’s flu vaccine was formulated and was behind most of the flu cases in Japan and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hirschwerk said currently RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, and COVID-19 are circulating at lower levels than they did this time last year, but pointed out that the holiday season and the numerous gatherings that can lead to more respiratory virus transmission have just started. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suffolk County had 562 cases the week ending Nov. 22, the most recent available from the state Health Department. That was up from 223 the prior week. Nassau County had 726 cases in the same time period, up from 378. Statewide, there was a similar increase in confirmed flu cases, which only represent a portion of actual flu cases since many people who are sick may not seek testing or treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State data shows hospitalizations for COVID-19 were up 2% to 292 the week ending Nov. 22 and RSV up 21% to 152. Flu increased 99% to 413. In addition, the number of&lt;a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-and-influenza-vaccination-data" target="_blank"&gt; people getting their flu vaccines has remained low&lt;/a&gt; — just about 20% of the population in Nassau County and 17% in Suffolk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/hcp/acip/index.html"&gt;recommended the flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; for those over 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are preparing for a challenging flu season and reminding parents that contrary to popular belief, the flu is potentially very serious for children," said Dr. Eve Meltzer Krief, a pediatrician at Allied Physicians Group’s Huntington Village Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She pointed out that there were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;280 influenza-associated pediatric flu deaths across the United States last year&lt;/a&gt; and 27 in New York State. Both were the highest number reported in a single season, according to state and federal officials. Most were not fully vaccinated and almost half did not have an underlying health condition that could have made them more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Getting the flu vaccine significantly reduces the risk for serious illness, hospitalization and death from the flu even in a year when the vaccine is not a good match for the circulating strain," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hirschwerk said now is a good time to get a flu vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are probably going to see a real climb [in flu cases] shortly," he said. "There’s no time like now to get it."&lt;span id="cke_bm_6116E"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisa L.

Or maybe the antibiotic has a direct impact on brain inflammation and brain wiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies using other antibiotics provide some clues. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0334-7"&gt;A 2019 study&lt;/a&gt; using  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="183403" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; derived from individuals with schizophrenia and healthy volunteers found that minocycline reduces the excessive pruning of synaptic connections that has been implicated in schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minocycline and doxycycline are both tetracycline antibiotics, so there may be some similarities in how they work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/owning-a-cat-could-double-your-risk-of-schizophrenia-research-suggests"&gt;Cat Ownership Linked to Increased Risk of Schizophrenia, Research Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using health data from Finland, Kelleher and his colleagues found that nearly half of all psychotic disorders diagnosed in the population occurred&lt;br&gt;
in individuals who had attended psychiatric services as adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They argue that this may be an opportune time to intervene, using medications such as doxycycline to reduce the chances of their condition progressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As many as half of the people who develop schizophrenia had previously attended child and adolescent mental health services for other mental health problems," &lt;a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/news/common-antibiotic-may-reduce-schizophrenia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kelleher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At present, though, we don't have any interventions that are known to reduce the risk of going on to develop schizophrenia in these young people.

While that rate is about the same as it has been on the same date in the two previous seasons, experts warn that with a mutated virus expected to arrive this winter, going unprotected is particularly risky this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already, a subtype of the H3N2 influenza virus called “subclade K” has spread rapidly across Europe, also showing up in Canada and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this variant has not yet carved itself a significant niche in America, experts warn that its arrival is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the European Health Security Agency said in its latest flu and COVID &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2025-to-2026-season/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-report-27-november-2025-week-48?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday, 11.6% of flu tests came back positive in the most recent seven-day rolling average, compared to a rate of less than 5% in the same week last season. The trend has been strongest in children ages 5 to 14, with the test positivity rate jumping from 30.7% to 35.7% in a single week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-b8vy2ye1" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_b8vy2ye1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While age-stratified test positivity rates were not available for San Diego County, the overall rate through Nov. 22 is 3.1% overall, according to the region’s respiratory virus report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pia Pannaraj, an infectious disease specialist at Rady Children’s Hospital, said she is urging her unvaccinated patients to roll up their sleeves. There is still a little time to go before peak flu is upon us. The infection rate is generally highest in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We still have probably two to three weeks to go, so if you get the vaccine now, it gives time for it to get to work over the next two weeks, and that will mean we’re ready when the flu does come our way,” Pannaraj said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A mutated virus spreading far and wide is reminiscent of 2009, when H1N1 “swine flu” caused what was eventually deemed a global pandemic. This virus was termed novel, meaning that it had significant enough mutations that the immune systems of most people had little resistance, inundating hospitals and often forcing emergency departments to erect parking lot tents to handle the overflow of incoming patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is subclade K a threat of similar magnitude?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ian Wilson, a structural virologist and immunologist with Scripps Research in San Diego, explained that this latest threat is not quite of the same magnitude as the H1N1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Subclass K is a result of standard virus evolution that goes on with seasonal flu from year to year and is termed antigenic drift,” Wilson said in an email. “It is not the same scenario as in 2009 when a completely new pandemic virus appeared that we call antigenic shift. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“That involves major changes in the virus and without much (if any) preexisting immunity in the population. Subclade K is not unlike what we see with SARS-CoV-2, when new variants keep emerging.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Some may note that subclade K is getting global attention because it has mutated enough that it is no longer a strong match for the H3N2 flu virus included in this season’s vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many will cite this fact as the main reason why getting vaccinated is not worth the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s true that the vaccine doesn’t give perfect protection,” Pannaraj said. “But we do have data already, mostly out of the UK, that shows that the current vaccine is about 70% protective against hospitalizations for children, and that’s actually a pretty good number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s only about 30% for adults, but even so, it’s still more than you would have without vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Robert “Chip” Schooley, an infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego Health, said that vaccination still provides protection, even if a vaccine is not a perfect match to a circulating virus, because the body’s production of protective antibodies is not binary,&lt;span&gt; either on or off like a switch.&lt;/span&gt; When stimulated, a range of immune cells are produced, targeting not just the example they were presented with by a vaccine, but also some that target a range of other related types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You create a broader array of antibodies, some of which are capable of binding to antigens that would be found on strains of influenza that are not the same as those in the vaccine,” Schooley said in an email. “The broader the repertoire of memory B-cells one develops with yearly vaccination, the better one gets at responding to broader trains of influenza.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination, then, triggers something of a shotgun approach to viral defense rather than loading up a sniper rifle to go after just one particular threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s a good analogy,” Schooley said. “Another would be that if you train a child to play music, as they learn to read music, they can play music that they’ve not seen before.”&lt;/p&gt;

The health department said it became aware of the infection "over the weekend," and began looking into where the resident may have visited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resident visited three different locations, the department said, and warned that anyone at the following locations at the indicated times may have been exposed to the virus:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kid Zone, 340 W. Antelope Drive, in Clearfield on Nov. 26, from 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treehouse Children's Museum, 347 22nd Street, in Ogden on Nov. 26 from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walmart Supercenter, 745 W. Hill Field Road, in Layton on Nov 26 from 6:20 p.m. to 7:20 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area, and anyone at these locations during the aforementioned times may have been exposed, even without direct contact with the resident, the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Willardson, the department's communicable disease and epidemiology division director, said the illness can be prevented with the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Being fully vaccinated against measles does more than just protect the person who receives the vaccination; it also protects their family and friends, including children who may be too young to be vaccinated, and it helps limit the spread of disease in the community, " she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department urges anyone who believes they may have measles or has been exposed to someone with measles to stay home and call their health care provider before seeking care so the provider can prevent exposure to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection marks the first case of measles in Davis County, though the state of Utah has reported 102 confirmed cases of measles as of Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The small molecule &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermine"&gt;spermine&lt;/a&gt; has the potential to stop the toxic build-up of proteins in the brain that characterizes diseases like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="183646" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="183646" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, researchers have found – and it works a bit like melting cheese on spaghetti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've known about spermine for more than 150 years: its regular job has to do with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-a-few-minutes-of-daily-activity-can-boost-your-metabolism-study-reveals"&gt;the body's metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, the business of converting food into energy, and keeping all of the key biological functions running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, researchers led by a team from the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland found that extra spermine given to worms with Alzheimer's and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-could-be-ignited-by-burned-out-brain-cells"&gt;Parkinson's-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt; showed improved health in old age, with cells less likely to lose power and wear out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/switch-turns-brains-defenses-into-protectors-against-alzheimers"&gt;Switch Turns Brain's Defenses Into Protectors Against Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A close analysis of cells in test tubes showed what was happening: the spermine encourages tau and alpha-synuclein proteins, typically misbehaving in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, to condense together into liquid-like droplets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, in turn, makes these toxic proteins easier for the body's waste recycling system, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"&gt;known as autophagy&lt;/a&gt;, to clear out, maintaining normal cell function. There's even a cooking analogy that describes what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The spermine is like cheese that connects the long, thin pasta without gluing them together, making them easier to digest," &lt;a href="https://www.psi.ch/en/news/media-releases/spermine-against-alzheimer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biophysicist Jinghui Luo, from PSI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183649" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183649" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/WormScans.jpg" alt="Worm spermine scans" class="wp-image-183649 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/WormScans.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/WormScans-600x412.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183649" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;When spermine was given to worms (bottom row), it reduced the level of protein clumping (brighter spots). (Sun et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Commun.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tau and alpha-synuclein are what's known as amyloid proteins, and when these proteins malfunction, they can form hard, sticky aggregates that go on to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-study-reveals-how-toxic-clumps-warp-neurons-at-their-core"&gt;damage brain cells&lt;/a&gt; in neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not fully clear if these clumps are a cause or consequence of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, but they're definitely involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spermine creates clumps of a kind, too, but they're softer and more mobile. This makes them easier to wipe away through the body's clean-up system, while also preventing the proteins from making solid plaques – which then become like crusted food stuck to the bottom of a pan, and much harder to remove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Autophagy is more effective at handling larger protein clumps," &lt;a href="https://www.psi.ch/en/news/media-releases/spermine-against-alzheimer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Luo. "And spermine is, so to speak, the binding agent that brings the strands together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are only weakly attractive electrical forces between the molecules, and these organize them but do not firmly bind them together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the researchers showed that spermine only interferes with tau and alpha-synuclein when they're at too high a concentration, and are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-first-synthetic-mini-prion-could-help-study-diseases-like-alzheimers"&gt;more likely to misfold&lt;/a&gt; under stress, leading to toxic clumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, it's a long way from test tube and worm experiments to seeing all of this working in a human brain with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, but these early signs are good ones. Extra spermine might help the brain clear problematic proteins more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spermine was chosen for the study because it has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4161/15384101.2014.973309"&gt;previously been shown&lt;/a&gt; to protect against damaging processes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/speaking-multiple-languages-may-slow-brain-aging-study-suggests"&gt;Speaking Multiple Languages May Slow Brain Aging, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After these results, the researchers are hopeful that spermine and molecules like it could be used to tackle multiple diseases, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="183646" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; – almost like special sauces mixed together to remove toxic processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we better understand the underlying processes, we can cook tastier and more digestible dishes, so to speak, because then we'll know exactly which spices, in which amounts, make the sauce especially tasty," &lt;a href="https://www.psi.ch/en/news/media-releases/spermine-against-alzheimer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Luo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-65426-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/thrush-22389"&gt;Thrush&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most common infections in the world. It's caused by the fungi &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;– specifically, the yeast &lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a019778"&gt;yeast infections&lt;/a&gt; are normally treated easily with antifungal drugs, a growing number of &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;species are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8020154"&gt;developing resistance&lt;/a&gt; to these drugs – including the species that causes thrush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/candidiasis/antimicrobial-resistance/index.html"&gt;about 7%&lt;/a&gt; of all &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;blood samples tested are resistant to the &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/fluconazole.html"&gt;antifungal drug fluconazole&lt;/a&gt;, the first-line drug used to treat most &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-fungi-live-inside-you-and-they-may-affect-your-health"&gt;These Fungi Live Inside You, And They May Affect Your Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means there are &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/25-10-2022-who-releases-first-ever-list-of-health-threatening-fungi"&gt;fewer treatment options&lt;/a&gt; for even routine thrush infections – making them more difficult to treat. It also means that &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/cmr.00029-06"&gt;more severe &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; infections&lt;/a&gt;, which can occur in people who have a weakened immune system or are taking long courses of antibiotics, will become even harder to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics16121555"&gt;Antifungal resistance&lt;/a&gt; may also be contributing to the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(18)30103-8"&gt;rise in recurrent thrush&lt;/a&gt; (thrush infections that continue to come back). This affects around 138 million women worldwide, but is expected to rise to 158 million people by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why resistance is growing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antifungal resistance landscape has changed dramatically over the past few decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early to mid-2000s, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.00029-06"&gt;antifungal resistance was rare&lt;/a&gt;. Fluconazole worked well for most&lt;em&gt; Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt; infections, less than 5% of which being resistant to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt; is a highly adaptable microorganism, which can easily develop resistance to antifungals under the right conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that resistance among &lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt; has been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jof11030232"&gt;trending upwards&lt;/a&gt; over the past eight years at least. A small study of patients in Egypt found that in 2024, nearly 26% of &lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt; isolates from blood samples were resistant to fluconazole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, more research is needed to understand whether this picture is the same worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jacamr/dlaf106"&gt;develop resistance&lt;/a&gt; to antifungal drugs through genetic mutations, which make them less susceptible to antifungals or help them reduce the drug's effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;can also protect itself from antifungal drugs by forming &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2217/fmb.13.101"&gt;tough biofilms&lt;/a&gt;. These &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2217/fmb.13.101"&gt;slimy layers&lt;/a&gt; of fungal cells block drugs from getting in, help the fungus pump any drugs that have penetrated the barrier back out, and allow some cells to hide in a resting state until treatment is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183799" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183799" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/candida_colonies_642.jpg" alt="candida colonies on an agar plate" class="wp-image-183799 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/candida_colonies_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/candida_colonies_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183799" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; can grow a tough, protective biofilm.

There are several factors that are contributing to the problem, including the misuse and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1354757"&gt;overuse of antifungal drugs&lt;/a&gt; (not just by people but in agriculture too) and the &lt;a href="https://en.fungaleducation.org/blog/2025/04/28/who-publishes-report-on-fungal-diagnostics-and-antifungal-treatments/"&gt;limited number&lt;/a&gt; of effective antifungal drugs that are available (which are difficult and expensive to develop).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing environmental temperatures, ecological stress, and fungicide use are also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01397-19"&gt;creating conditions&lt;/a&gt; that favour heat-tolerant and drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;strains – such as &lt;em&gt;Candida auris&lt;/em&gt;, which is highly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S249864"&gt;resistant to multiple classes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/apm.13336"&gt;antifungal drugs&lt;/a&gt;, and can cause severe infection in people who have a weakened immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preventing antifungal resistance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1258837"&gt;primarily transmitted&lt;/a&gt; through person-to-person contact, sexual contact, and contact with contaminated objects or surfaces. In healthcare settings, &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;can also spread through &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1258837"&gt;contaminated medical equipment&lt;/a&gt; and devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airborne transmission is not common with &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt;. However, an alarming &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.5c00795"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; reported that species of &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; resistant to common antifungal drugs were detected in urban air samples in Hong Kong. This included &lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;in air could increase the likelihood of community spread and elevate the risk of inhalation – particularly in hospitals, crowded areas, or care homes with immunocompromised people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This represents a potential route of exposure that has previously been underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183801" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183801" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/care_home_642.jpg" alt="care home" class="wp-image-183801 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/care_home_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/care_home_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183801" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Presence of &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; in crowded care homes and hospitals can increase its spread.

Maintaining a healthy microbiome is key to protecting yourself: the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2021.1979877"&gt;beneficial bacteria&lt;/a&gt; in your body help keep &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;levels under control and prevent it from overgrowing and becoming problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when the balance of your friendly bacteria is disrupted – for example, by antibiotics, poor diet, a weakened immune system, or high stress – &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13099-025-00755-8"&gt;grow out of control&lt;/a&gt;, leading to illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microbiome disruption can also create conditions where antifungal-resistant &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;can overgrow, form resistant biofilms, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.00610-24"&gt;become harder to treat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/powerful-new-antibiotic-was-hiding-in-plain-sight-for-decades"&gt;Powerful New Antibiotic Was 'Hiding in Plain Sight' For Decades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10020183"&gt;Looking after your microbiome&lt;/a&gt; can make a significant difference in reducing the risk of Candida and other infections. This involves eating a diverse, fibre-rich diet – including fermented foods – and limiting highly processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only take antibiotics when prescribed. Probiotics and prebiotics may also help &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2023.1187831"&gt;maintain your microbiome balance&lt;/a&gt;, especially after antibiotic use or recurrent infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;infections are treatable, drug-resistant strains and infections in vulnerable people can be serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we can all do our part to prevent resistant strains from developing – including by only taking antifungal medicines exactly as prescribed, completing the full course, and maintaining good hygiene.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267915/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

He was 46. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just weeks earlier, he had undergone genetic testing that came back positive for Lynch syndrome - a condition caused by hereditary genetic mutations which increases the risk of colon cancer even in &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15208783/Colon-cancer-rising-young-people-study-global.html"&gt;young, otherwise healthy, adults&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As such, Tiffany's widowed aunt urged her and the rest of her family to also get tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the time, it wasn't even a thing I knew to be scared of,' Tiffany, now 43, told the Daily Mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But testing confirmed the worst: Tiffany - and her brother too - had Lynch syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Ohio native - who had just turned 30 and was pregnant with her youngest of two sons at the time - was now up to 80 percent more likely than her peers to develop colorectal, endometrial, breast, stomach, esophageal, pancreatic and skin cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tiffany Graham Charkosky (pictured here as a child with her mother) was just 11 years old when her mother died of colon cancer. Two decades later, Tiffany learned she has Lynch syndrome, which dramatically raises her risk of several forms of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was pretty shocking. I was right around the age that my mom had gotten sick,' she told the Daily Mail. 'That definitely sent me into a tailspin of worrying about my own health, then the health of my family.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 300 Americans (roughly one million people) are born with Lynch syndrome. However, upward of nine in 10 don't know they have it since genetic testing is the only detection method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For that testing to happen, patients generally have to wait until they or a family member are diagnosed with one of the forms of cancer it is linked to, leaving hundreds of thousands unaware of their risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lynch syndrome is caused by a mutation in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 genes, which are responsible for repairing mistakes in DNA. Mutations in these raise the risk of cells multiplying uncontrollably and becoming cancerous.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lynch syndrome most often raises the likelihood of developing colorectal cancer, which has skyrocketed in young Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the past two decades, the rate of colorectal cancer in people under 50 has risen from 8.6 cases per 100,000 people in 1999 to 13 cases per 100,000 people in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer diagnoses in 20 to 34-year-olds are estimated to increase by 90 percent between 2010 and 2030, and rates for teenagers have already surged 500 percent since the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average American has a five percent risk of developing colorectal cancer, but for a patient with Lynch syndrome, that likelihood jumps to anywhere from 40 to 80 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women, according to MD Anderson Cancer Center, are also at a 40 to 60 percent greater risk of developing ovarian and breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before being diagnosed with the syndrome, Tiffany and her siblings were undergoing colonoscopies every five years to check for colorectal cancer due to their mother's early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, unless a patient has a relevant family history, colonoscopies are only recommended every 10 years and not until age 45. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tiffany is pictured here as a child with her uncle, who died of colon cancer at age 46. His death prompted the family to be tested for Lynch syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tiffany (pictured) now gets regular screenings for colon, breast, skin and esophageal cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since being diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, Tiffany now gets colonoscopies every year, along with endoscopies to check for esophageal cancer every one to three years, along with annual mammograms for breast cancer and exams to check for skin cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had a hysterectomy six months after her diagnosis to prevent uterine and cervical cancer. Just after her 40th birthday, doctors removed her ovaries to prevent ovarian cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer is also often caused by diets high in red and processed meats, fat and sodium, so Tiffany tried to focus on eating whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Graham Charkosky's book, Living Proof, was released last month&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just try to live a life of moderation,' she told the Daily Mail. '[I try] to sleep as well as I can and try to make exercise a priority. It's more about trying to live a balanced life than it is about trying to restrict my diet. That has been what makes me feel best in the long run so far.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is currently unclear if Tiffany's two sons, who are 13 and 16, also have Lynch syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors recommend waiting until they become adults to test them so they can better cope with the 'emotional weight' of the disorder, if they have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The recommendation is to let your children get older so that they can make informed medical decisions and process that information in an age-appropriate way,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early years after her diagnosis, Tiffany searched for literature on Lynch syndrome but with little luck. So in 2015, three years after her diagnosis, she wrote the book herself, titled 'Living Proof: How Love Defied Genetic Legacy'. It came out in October this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was like three years past the initial shock and "newborn phase", and all of that really struck me - that I wasn't done thinking about this and felt like I was maybe in a position of trying to organize my thoughts and share what that journey looked like,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tiffany says she hopes that, by reading her book, other people with Lynch syndrome are able to 'take some agency' back when the cancer risk feels uncontrollable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I want them to know that they didn't do anything wrong, that they're still who they've always been and that in facing their risks head on, as scary as it is, they're setting themselves up for a better future,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;Living Proof: How Love Defied Genetic Legac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;y on Amazon, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and others through Little A publishing.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                The U.S. has marked World AIDS Day — the first global day dedicated to a health issue — since its creation in 1988. From left: President Joe Biden delivers remarks at a World AIDS Day event on the South Lawn at the White House on December 1, 2024. President George W. Bush with First Lady Laura Bush commemorate World AIDS Day on December 1, 2008 on the North Lawn of the White House.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The State Department issued a terse statement last week saying, "an awareness day is not a strategy." The result is that on December 1, the United States is not commemorating World AIDS Day. It's the first time the U.S. has not participated since the World Health Organization created this day in 1988 to remember the &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/UNAIDS_FactSheet_en.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;millions of people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who have died of AIDS-related illnesses and recommit to fighting the epidemic that still claims the lives of more than half a million people each year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By contrast, last year former President Joe Biden held a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House with the &lt;a href="https://www.aidsmemorial.org/quilt-history" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AIDS Memorial Quilt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — with coffin-shaped patches each honoring someone who had died of AIDS-related causes — spread out on the grass. And this year, despite the Trump administration's change of heart, countries around the world are marking the day with proclamations, public health campaigns and commemorative ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then and now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;President Trump has nothing planned for this year and the State Department has instructed employees not to mark the day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tommy Pigott, a spokesperson for the State Department, confirmed the decision not to commemorate the day, writing in a statement that the country is "modernizing our approach to countering infectious diseases" and that "under the leadership of President Trump, the State Department is working directly with foreign governments to save lives and increase their responsibility and burden sharing."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some HIV/AIDS activists reacted with frustration to the news — and with protests.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it's emblematic of an administration that doesn't seem to care," said &lt;a href="https://avac.org/mitchell-warren/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mitchell Warren&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the executive director of AVAC, a global HIV prevention organization based in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. has consistently been the top financial supporter of the global fight against HIV/AIDS, primarily through President George W. Bush's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which has invested more than &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$110 billion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into the global effort since it launched in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, since the start of President Trump's second term, almost a year ago, his administration has made major cuts to global health spending and programing as it champions an America First approach and emphasizes countries being weaned off aid. This has disrupted HIV/AID care in many parts of the world — including making it challenging for some HIV-positive individuals to get their medication in places such as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/04/14/g-s1-59863/hiv-aids-drugs-usaid-zambia" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zambia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Kenya, according to UNAIDS.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Is this a symbolic act? Yes, it is and it symbolizes something that is actually devastating and chaotic," says Warren.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. is not alone in reducing international aid, as other countries – including France, Germany and the United Kingdom — have scaled back on foreign assistance as they shift priorities. The &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2025/november/wad-2025-report" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;UNAIDS report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for World AIDS Day this year warned of "ruinous consequences."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Protesters gathered outside the White House on Monday, demanding that funding be restored. Asia Russell – executive director of Health GAP, a global HIV advocacy organization – was one of them. She says the decision not to mark the day was reminiscent of the early days of the HIV/AIDS fight when the disease was highly stigmatized and overlooked as a public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In recent years, medical advances have meant there's been progress in the combatting new HIV/AIDS injection and getting those who are already infected on treatment. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So what's missing is political will, and that lack of political will was on devastating display when the White House announced that it would ban commemoration of this pandemic. It's truly depraved and outrageous," Russell says, adding that there were about 100 other people at the protest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The decision not to mark World AIDS Day is in line with the administration's broader approach to WHO and the United Nations more broadly. Trump has been critical of multilateral organizations like the U.N. and of WHO's handling of COVID. One of his first moves, on inauguration day, was to start the process of &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;removing the U.S. from the WHO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Trump Administration has marked other days designated by the UN, such as World Autism Awareness Day. The White House issued a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/world-autism-awareness-day-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;proclamation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for that day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;World AIDS Day "only exists on the calendar because of pressure from people with HIV and their communities fighting back against stigma," Russell says. "A commemorative day, as minor as that might sound, is actually life-saving work to chip away at that deadly stigma."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Health care providers in Portland and elsewhere in Maine have been preparing for a potential spike in cases, with some telling the Bangor Daily News last month that they expected the outbreak to spread beyond the Bangor area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s definitely not the news we want to hear, and it’s also something we’ve been bracing for for a while,” Katie Rutherford, executive director of the Portland-based Frannie Peabody Center, said Monday. Her organization is a nonprofit focused on HIV/AIDS services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maine CDC directive noted that the agency is working with community organizations and medical providers to increase access to HIV and hepatitis C testing in Cumberland County, link people to care, and offer prevention services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alert also encouraged providers statewide to “ensure these services are available in communities throughout Maine” and recommended testing every three months for people at higher risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rutherford said she is in close contact with the Maine CDC and other organizations in the area that are working on “spreading our capacity as much as possible so that we can reach as many people as we can” with resources like HIV testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These groups will aim to reach populations that are at the highest risk of infection while also “just generally getting the message out to the community that HIV testing is really important and should be part of routine care,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The directive from Maine CDC did not use the word “cluster” to describe the new set of cases in Cumberland County, the most populated county in the state, although public health officials referred to the earliest cases in Penobscot County as a cluster when case numbers were at similar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Cumberland County, Penobscot County previously saw an average of one HIV case per year in people who inject drugs before the outbreak began, according to the Maine CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. CDC does not define HIV clusters or outbreaks based on any specific number of cases, but more generally as “groups of people that are experiencing rapid HIV transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindsay Hammes, a spokesperson for the Maine CDC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BDN previously reported that organizations outside of Penobscot County have been ramping up HIV testing efforts, including expanding access to self-test kits, in response to the ongoing outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Frannie Peabody Center provides free HIV test kits via mail and sends them out in discreet packaging, Rutherford said. They are available to order on the organization’s website. Rutherford also noted that HIV tests are not always included in routine care at medical offices, so people who want to be tested with their provider may have to ask specifically for an HIV test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maine-based public health organizations have raised concerns about proposed cuts to HIV services at the federal level and how those could limit the state’s efforts to contain the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The House appropriations bill for next year proposed cutting $1.7 billion in funding for HIV programs, including completely eliminating HIV prevention programs and reducing care and treatment funding by 20 percent, according to the HIV and Hepatitis Policy Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s just an important reminder that the AIDS epidemic is not over,” Rutherford said, noting that Monday is World AIDS Day. This is the first year the federal government has not recognized the day since it was first designated in 1988.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WGME</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 21:54:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxORkZZbW1IRGU4V0E2U2RxbndrV21zbllsSncyMVhHTU5qbldELUh0Rlptc0tOSjE2Ql9vWkNLSzJtbzhObmhfOW9ibDdnZjI5ZEJpaUxlbHNOYWtFdURPOTRsb2wxSjlBNmtiXzM3Z1lRbjZCMnpoUkdQMWtWc3ZrTEhyeExlU1p2ZzVGWmZUTzg3Wm5FQjFadHdfemQ1OENk</guid></item><item><title>麦当娜抨击特朗普不承认世界艾滋病日： “荒谬” -滚石</title><link>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/madonna-slams-trump-not-acknowledging-world-aids-day-1235475297/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pmc-paywall"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	&lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/madonna/" id="auto-tag_madonna" data-tag="madonna"&gt;Madonna&lt;/a&gt; is commemorating &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dua-lipa-prep-day-performance-1235444752/"&gt;World&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dua-lipa-prep-day-performance-1235444752/"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dua-lipa-prep-day-performance-1235444752/"&gt;Day&lt;/a&gt; and condemning &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/donald-trump/" id="auto-tag_donald-trump" data-tag="donald-trump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;‘s decision not to acknowledge the Dec. 1 date. In an Instagram post on Monday, the Queen of Pop slammed Trump as “ridiculous” and “unthinkable” for not highlighting the effects of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“Today is World &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/aids/" id="auto-tag_aids" data-tag="aids"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; Day. For four decades, this day has been internationally recognized around the world by people from all walks of life, because millions of people’s lives have been touched by the HIV crisis,” Madonna wrote. “People have lost lovers and husbands and wives and girlfriends and boyfriends and mothers and daughters and children to this deadly disease, of which there is still no cure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“Donald Trump has announced that &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/world-aids-day/" id="auto-tag_world-aids-day" data-tag="world-aids-day"&gt;World AIDS Day&lt;/a&gt; should no longer be acknowledged,” Madonna added. “It’s one thing to order federal agents to refrain from commemorating this day, but to ask the general public to pretend it never happened is ridiculous, it’s absurd, it’s unthinkable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The United States has commemorated Dec. 1 as World Aids Day since 1988, but this year the Department of State told government employees to “refrain from publicly promoting” the day on social media, speeches, and public messaging.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Madonna continued by mentioning her closeness with the losses associated with the disease, including Martin Borgoyne, her roommate and former tour manager, who died of AIDS in 1986. “I bet he’s never watched his best friend die of AIDS, held their hand, and watched the blood drain from their face as they took their last breath at the age of 23,” she wrote. 

	&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Madonna shared that she had a “pretty long” list of friends who died because of the disease, including Chris Flynn, her first dance teacher, and artist Keith Haring, who died from issues related to the disease in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“I’m sure many of you out there can relate. Let me say it one more time—there still isn’t a cure for AIDS, and people still die from it,” Madonna wrote. “I refuse to acknowledge that these people have died in vain. And I will continue to honor World AIDS Day, and I hope you will honor it with me.”&lt;/p&gt;

The American Heart Association (AHA) stresses that lifestyle choices play a crucial role in managing it, and cardiologists say the first step is identifying one common eating habit that quietly worsens blood pressure for millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The top habit to stop in hypertension&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important dietary change for people with hypertension is lowering sodium intake, especially by avoiding the excess sodium found in processed, packaged and restaurant foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Understanding hypertension as a major risk factor for the heart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Heart Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 70–75 percent of the sodium Americans consume comes from hidden sources, not from the salt shaker. The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK highlights the same trend, noting that most salt is added during food manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess sodium increases blood pressure by causing the body to retain water, which raises blood volume and increases pressure on artery walls.

Exercise regularly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AHA advises 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity improves vascular elasticity and lowers blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Manage stress and prioritise sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific studies show that chronic stress and irregular sleep patterns elevate blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness, breathing exercises and consistent sleep routines can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Limit alcohol and avoid smoking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both habits stiffen arteries and increase hypertension risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Monitor blood pressure consistently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends home monitoring and following prescribed medication schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypertension is serious but highly manageable. Cardiologists and public health agencies agree that reducing excess dietary sodium, especially from processed and restaurant foods, is the most impactful dietary change for controlling blood pressure. Combined with exercise, better sleep, and regular check-ups, a lower-salt diet can significantly reduce long-term cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

Rehabbers cannot legally accept animals for treatment not covered by their state and federal licensing, but we will always try and point you in the right direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be honest and truthful when asked for information. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rabies in humans has a &amp;gt;99% fatality rate without treatment, and post-exposure vaccinations must be started within 48-72 hours of exposure. Fewer than 35 people in the last 50 years have survived rabies once symptoms appeared. These individuals were treated with a variety of highly experimental protocols, and there is not yet a validated, accepted treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take a minute and assess the situation before attempting to capture wildlife without direction. You can reach out to licensed rehabilitators through Animal Help Now and also receive guidance from your state wildlife resource division. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[SIGN UP: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://membercenter.whio.com/newsletters" target="_self" rel="" title="https://membercenter.whio.com/newsletters"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph body-copyright"&gt;©2025 Cox Media Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WHIO TV</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 21:29:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4AFBVV95cUxQbGNiOWFxY25jYnVld05NLTJaYUo5TGtoZ2VNbEJ4WXlQZU03Y0JlT1YwQkFWc0tOV2pIaFZ4ZlZzSkhKNkNDM1liajNXR0xSQmxxdEQ2NHJQMmpTTmVzUy1pbFliQXNYdDR6dktUaHctUkd6LXdoUW5yLWsxU25BY3JNNm1ZS09nX2phX0F5Qk52QUFvNjJDelBlaUJQR1lsS2dVV1AzSmdkbW9FbjFXYzduaUw4dldBazBqcEtyVFlFVW4tZW54QmQ4dGp2b3RYNDd4RXBUN0dTRmtvUXlNYtIB9AFBVV95cUxQRDJBaDljUXN0Q0o1OFhKdzVhbllNU3RNb2V3RTRBVnVrXzVnbWFiY3VwM2NNTXRwanhXbG5GV0o1emd3a1l0UVlNMFlfZUJjWDRUZnhkYkhPSUlXekFfa1NYVVRsUGV6QThXU2NjUDNkOGQzdDhXbUs1azgwdzZzbkVsNlJ3RGhtaUY3WjFIWDcwV3ZqdUVXWk5NRS1rSlVSeWJiUHREREowd2NpdXlQYjlzdTJ6SnJIWmE4bDNGN0ItRU1KNEh4M0JTYWVzMGktM3Q3RFg5bF9oYkZKbF9zWXNxTXdiM1NhUllhaEJqNHU3MURm</guid></item><item><title>古巴说，随着流行病的蔓延， 33人死于蚊子传播的疾病--路透社</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/cuba-says-33-have-died-mosquito-borne-illnesses-epidemic-rages-2025-12-01/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 21:24:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxOM1k3TEttck0xX3lUMUFHeGtWLUtBMW1ackpyR2VicjZic0FrR0puN0hvRHVONllXV0E3T3g3NjQ1S3pFNEV0SGdzRzJVRmF1bGVHcXZIY1VyLTNoU0hkZjVhOXBtRXZzSHp6eDhxZUxGNDRLUngwMGluZW94T2tYRXhWTkhQQkJpeGR0Z245ZFJLNU9fMXBiY2VHOFpqT09Mc0RaRGltUXI3Z3YzRTFPMGU2T3RlS3I3Z0pudV9fV2d6ZFo0alJlUjJJNkFIZTg</guid></item><item><title>新任ACIP主席将新冠肺炎疫情要求与大屠杀进行比较，称枪击导致癌症、流产- Endpoints News</title><link>https://endpoints.news/new-acip-chair-claims-covid-19-vaccines-caused-cancer-miscarriages/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="epn_content"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Having a smartphone may be harmful for children younger than 12, according to a new study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-072941/205716/Smartphone-Ownership-Age-of-Smartphone-Acquisition?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; found that owning a smartphone during early adolescence is associated with increased risks of mental health issues and obesity. As far as psychological impacts, it pinpointed higher incidences of depression and insufficient sleep among children who owned smartphones by ages 12 or younger, compared with others kids without the devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, the University of California at Berkeley, and Columbia University arrived at those conclusions after analyzing data from more than 10,000 adolescents around the United States who participated in the &lt;a href="https://abcdstudy.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study&lt;/a&gt; (ABCD) between 2018 and 2020. That study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, describes itself as "the largest long-term study of brain development and child health" in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to researchers, 63.6% of the ABCD study's participants owned a smartphone, and the median age they received them was at 11 years old. Using that data, the researchers determined that younger children had greater risks than older participants of poor sleep or obesity linked to smartphone ownership, with increasingly worse health outcomes reported for kids the younger they were when they received their first smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We didn't even look at what the kids did on the phone," Ran Barzilay, the lead author of the study and a child psychiatrist with the Youth Suicide Prevention, Intervention and Research Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News. "We basically asked one simple question: does the mere factor of having one's own smartphone at this age range have anything to do with health outcomes?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pediatrics study also compared children who had obtained a smartphone by age 12 and children who had not, and found that one year later, those without smartphones were experiencing better mental health than those who had them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did account for the fact that the kids may have had other technological devices like tablets or iPads, and it did not change the results," Barzilay said in an interview on CBS News' "The Daily Report."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/childrens-hospital-of-philadelphia-study-links-smartphone-ownership-in-childhood-to-increased-risk-of-depression-and-obesity-in-youth-302627044.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, Barzilay said his study's findings suggest that parents should see smartphones as having "a significant factor in teen health" and approach the decision to give children a phone with care and consideration. He noted that smartphones "can play a constructive role" in teens' lives by strengthening their social connections and helping them learn, adding that some families see smartphones as necessary for their children's safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, Barzilay said the researchers behind the study hope to investigate which aspects of smartphone use and ownership are connected with negative health effects for young people. Researchers intend to study younger children, who acquired smartphones before age 10, in an effort to understand who is most vulnerable to the detrimental impacts of smartphone use who and who could most benefit from it. Ultimately, Barzilay said the goal is to identify ways to protect children and adolescents who own smartphones from the consequences outlined in their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, a growing number of experts have sounded the alarm about increased screen time and the effect it has on kids and teens. In a 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sg-youth-mental-health-social-media-advisory.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;advisory&lt;/a&gt; on social media use and mental health, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy recommended creating &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/surgeon-general-social-media-teen-health-vivek-murthy/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;"tech-free zones"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and encouraging kids to "foster in-person friendships."

More than half of parents with children between the ages of 11 and 12 who were surveyed by the research center at that time said their kids also owned smartphones. The same survey found that nearly 30% of parents with children between 8 and 10 years old said their kids owned smartphones, as did 12% of parents with children between 5 and 7 years old, and 8% of parents with children younger than 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most probably, all teens will eventually have a smartphone," said Barzilay. "Once this happens, it is advisable to monitor what our children do on their phones, ensuring they're not exposed to inappropriate content and that smartphones don't disrupt sleep."&lt;/p&gt;

When these power stations fail, the body struggles to burn sugar and fat, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/unexpected-weight-gain-linked-to-a-common-cooking-oil/"&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt; and high blood sugar become more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-magnesium-s-role-in-energy"&gt;Magnesium’s role in energy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mineral &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/seeds-rich-in-protein-and-magnesium-help-grow-muscle-mass-fenugreek/"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, a charged mineral that helps many enzymes work, is essential for life. It supports muscle function and takes part in hundreds of reactions that turn food into cellular fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To move magnesium in and out, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/damaged-mitochondria-recycled/"&gt;mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; use a special ion channel, a protein tunnel that lets charged atoms cross a membrane. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main channel that pulls magnesium into mitochondria is called MRS2. It sets how much of this ion enters the organelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When too much &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/magnesium-threonate-is-best-supplement-for-improving-brain-health-says-neurologist/"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; collects inside mitochondria, their energy output can slow down instead of speeding up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, this slowdown can feed into metabolic syndrome. That’s a cluster of high blood sugar, unhealthy cholesterol, and raised blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some body fat is especially active. So-called brown fat, a type of fat that burns energy to make heat, can help protect against weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-cpacc-controls-weight"&gt;How CPACC controls weight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new mouse study, researchers blocked MRS2 so that less magnesium entered the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/memory-loss-is-reversed-by-activating-mitochondria-in-the-brain/"&gt;mitochondria&lt;/a&gt;. Mice that lacked this protein or had it blocked burned sugar and fat more efficiently, even though they ate the same rich food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then designed CPACC, a lab-made, cobalt-based molecule that blocks MRS2. Animals given CPACC showed reduced weight and white adipose tissue – the usual body fat under the skin – that resembled heat-producing fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers noted that giving the drug to mice for a short period led to quick weight loss and a slimmer appearance. Such a treatment could cut cardiometabolic risks and lower liver cancer odds, creating a major health impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cpacc-is-not-a-junk-food-pass"&gt;CPACC is not a junk-food pass&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these experiments are preclinical – early lab and animal research done before human testing – and they were carried out only in mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice share many metabolic features with humans. But drugs that work well in mice often fail when researchers test them in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPACC contains cobalt, and certain inorganic cobalt salts can be toxic at high &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK587403/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;exposures&lt;/a&gt;. Any future human version will need very careful safety checks to make sure it does not harm the heart, nerves, or other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people, no pill can replace healthy food and regular movement. Even if a magnesium-targeting drug eventually reaches clinical trial, it would likely treat severe obesity or liver disease, not excuse junk food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mouse results are still important because they reveal a new way to regulate metabolism. By tuning how magnesium flows into mitochondria, scientists may be able to shift the body from storing energy toward burning it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cpacc-and-weight-control"&gt;CPACC and weight control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work will test different doses and schedules of CPACC and related molecules and explore how they affect weight, heart, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/astronauts-kidneys-may-not-survive-a-roundtrip-to-mars/"&gt;kidney&lt;/a&gt;, and brain health in animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also want to see whether similar strategies can protect against insulin resistance, the state when the body stops responding well to insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In time, magnesium handling inside mitochondria could become a target for personalized medicine, tailoring treatments to a person’s unique biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some people might have variants in the MRS2 gene or related pathways that make them respond better to this kind of drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same pathway could also matter for people at high risk of heart attack, stroke, and liver cancer because of long-standing &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/obesity-is-much-more-complicated-than-we-thought-manifesting-in-11-different-forms/"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If safe blockers of mitochondrial magnesium uptake can be designed, they may one day sit alongside diet and exercise to reduce obesity-related disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124723001663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 19:23:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNcldwUzdrMFlrSGFSV1paTF9rRTdlV05qbDU2WDBpY2t4bjJZZmsySWpOcVJ1Rmc1XzBpcHpwRHhRMEFNWXp2TGEwSmlYakVhdzBOU3hvOUszM2txaWpJS1NxVGtsRWpjOFh4UXZhMDM0MWxjQzNpa3YwUFg0aTNHTmVSdXdSV2xsdm5PTUJmeEhfNHN1TWpZSW1XaFlkWVU</guid></item></channel></rss>
