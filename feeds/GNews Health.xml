The diagnosis raised alarm bells because the disease is rare in North America. Chikungunya has historically often been spread via yellow fever mosquitoes, which aren't native to the New York region, the Times detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, Asian tiger mosquitoes are increasingly carrying the disease and have extended their range to various Northeast states. These particular vectors have become &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0060874" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more common;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;more common&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. because warmer winters have been hospitable to their eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The woman described experiencing intense joint pain, a common symptom of chikungunya. She said it felt like her feet, ankles, wrists, hands, and shoulders were being pulled apart, according to the Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is chikungunya concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chikungunya has not been documented as locally transmitted in the U.S. for about a decade, according to the Times. However, warmer weather across the country has attracted mosquitoes carrying various diseases. Unusually high winter temperatures have also extended mosquito season, which can create and prolong disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Not only does human activity impact the planet, but it also impacts our health. The pollution we create, whether that's in landfills or through dirty energy usage, contributes to heat-trapping gases in our atmosphere. This creates warmer weather that allows disease-carrying vectors to become acclimated to new areas. As a result, people can become exposed to illnesses like chikungunya, which is potentially disabling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about chikungunya?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because of how excruciating chikungunya can be, it's important to prevent and monitor its spread. The disease hasn't become a major public health issue in the United States. A Department of Health spokesperson told the Times that transmission remains low. One expert shared insight on how a vector carrying chikungunya may have made its way to the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Mosquitoes are sometimes carried back in luggage or in airplanes," Dr. Bruce Farber, an infectious disease expert at Northwell Health, told the Times&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, the infected woman wanted to share her story to raise awareness about the possible presence of chikungunya. She did not travel outside of the country recently, so she would not have known to check for the disease. Her experience reinforces that people experiencing symptoms and doctors should continue to screen for the illness to track its transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meanwhile, individuals can do their part to cut back on the harmful pollution that warms the planet. Some ways to do this include &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/make-your-next-car-an-ev/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:switching to an electric vehicle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;switching to an electric vehicle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:using less plastic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;using less plastic&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jennifer Aniston adds egg whites to her oatmeal for extra protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One large egg white has about four grams of protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other ways to add protein to oatmeal include milk, yogurt and nut butter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Actress Jennifer Aniston has always been on trend. Whether it’s her hair, her projects or her food, she’s elegant and ahead of her time. While &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/2058625/high-protein-dinner-plan/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-protein meals&lt;/a&gt; are all the rage now, Aniston has been upping her protein all along, as revealed in an interview to &lt;a href="https://www.elle.com/beauty/health-fitness/a35335/jennifer-aniston-beauty-interview-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. Case in point: Aniston adds &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/joy-bauers-protein-packed-oatmeal-is-perfect-for-busy-mornings-8709502" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;egg whites to her oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;. While a lot has changed since 2016, we think this breakfast hack might be timeless.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When the &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; star wakes up, her morning routine involves &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291947/the-benefits-of-warm-lemon-water/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lemon water first thing&lt;/a&gt;. For breakfast, she chooses between a shake, avocado and eggs, puffed millet cereal with banana or oatmeal with a whipped egg white
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of her choices, the oatmeal upgrade stood out to us immediately. “Right before [the oatmeal] is finished cooking, you just whip in an egg white and it kind of gives it this fluffy texture that's delicious," Aniston explained to &lt;em&gt;Elle&lt;/em&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s probably safe to assume Aniston is cooking her oats on the stovetop and not in the microwave when she adds in the egg. Depending on the egg, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7905415/are-egg-whites-healthy-heres-what-a-dietitian-says/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;most egg whites have about three to four grams of protein&lt;/a&gt; and minimal fat, unlike a whole egg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With very little carbs and sodium, an egg white is an easy way to dial up protein without dialing up much else—which means it can work in plenty of other dishes, too. Plus, whipping it up beforehand, as Aniston does, makes it even easier to fold into the oatmeal for an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/10-minute-breakfast-recipes-with-5-ingredients-or-less-8700312" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;easy breakfast solution&lt;/a&gt;.

There’s no reason oats, which have a neutral flavor, have to be mixed with sugar—they can have &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/267654/savory-oatmeal-with-cheddar-collards-eggs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt;, vegetables of all kinds and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/281184/savory-oatmeal-with-tomato-sausage/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt; like sausage added in, too. Both cheese and meat have varying amounts of protein that, combined with fat and fiber, will keep you fuller longer.

		&lt;p&gt;France’s 60 Millions de consommateurs has tested popular extra-virgin oils and raised a red flag. The magazine says several bottles carried contaminants linked to plastic packaging and processing. The alert targets a short list of brands, and it asks regular users to pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What the consumer tests found&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magazine reviewed 24 well-known extra-virgin olive oils sold in French supermarkets. Most met expectations on taste and basic quality markers. Concerns emerged when lab screens looked for unwanted chemicals. The tests picked up traces of plasticizers and mineral oil hydrocarbons in many samples, with a handful showing higher levels than the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magazine reports elevated levels of two phthalates — DEHP and DBP — in four extra-virgin references, and urges shoppers to steer clear of those batches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874125"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasticizers can migrate from certain packaging or processing materials. Mineral oils can come from lubricants, inks, or transport materials. Even tiny amounts raise questions, because olive oil dissolves lipophilic molecules easily. Regular users face repeated exposure over time, which can lift the total dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why plasticizers land in oil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olive oil is a fatty matrix. It pulls in chemicals that prefer fat over water. When oil sits in soft plastics, or passes through tubing and seals that contain phthalates, some of those molecules can move into the liquid. Storage heat speeds that process. So do long shelf times and light exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phthalates like DEHP and DBP are regulated in the EU and flagged as endocrine disruptors with potential reproductive effects at certain exposure levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874126"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mineral oil hydrocarbons have another path. They can drip from machinery grease. They can rub off from recycled cardboard or printed packaging. Some lots show more than others, which points to equipment, logistics, and packaging choices rather than the olives themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The four brands flagged by the magazine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to 60 Millions de consommateurs, these extra-virgin oils showed the highest phthalate levels in their panel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Brand (as tested)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Issue reported by the magazine&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Naturalia Vierge Extra “Like a Virgin”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Elevated DEHP/DBP compared with the panel&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;La Vie Claire Vierge Extra&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Elevated DEHP/DBP compared with the panel&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Terra Delyssa Vierge Extra&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Elevated DEHP/DBP compared with the panel&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cauvin Bio “La Bio”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Elevated DEHP/DBP compared with the panel&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874128"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magazine stresses that many other products tested did not raise the same level of concern. Still, it advises heavy users to swap away from the four names above and to favor low-contaminant oils in glass. Results can vary by batch. A single bad lot does not define a brand forever, yet consumer pressure often speeds corrective action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What this means for your kitchen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can lower your exposure without giving up olive oil’s benefits. Focus on packaging, storage, and how you shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick dark glass or metal tins, check harvest dates, and store cool and away from light. These three steps do most of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose dark glass or tin over plastic. Fatty foods and plastic do not mix well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for “extra virgin,” “cold extraction,” and a harvest date. Fresher oil needs less aggressive processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep bottles in a cool, dark place. Heat and light speed chemical migration and oxidation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy smaller formats if you cook rarely. An open bottle ages fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smell and taste before a big drizzle. Fresh oil smells green and fruity, with a light bitterness and a peppery finish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874129"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to read an olive oil label&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labels carry clues about both quality and risk. They also help you compare like-for-like products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quality cues that matter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Extra virgin” signals low free acidity (≤ 0.8 g/100 g) and no heat refining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Country or region of origin gives traceability. Single-origin oils tend to be tighter controlled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harvest year beats “best before” for freshness. Aim for the latest harvest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Varietal mention (e.g., Koroneiki, Picual) aligns flavor and stability with your cooking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protected designations (PDO/PGI) indicate rules on production and audits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What scientists say about risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context helps. Most tests find small amounts of contaminants in fatty foods. Risk depends on dose, frequency, and who is exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Phthalates and endocrine disruption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEHP and DBP belong to a group linked to hormonal interference in animal and epidemiological studies. Regulators set strict migration limits for food contact materials in Europe. Infants, children, and people seeking pregnancy often sit at the center of precautionary advice. Cutting repeated low-level exposures across many sources — food, dust, packaging — reduces the overall load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mineral oil hydrocarbons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOSH (saturated) can build up in the body over time. MOAH (aromatic) raises extra concern, as some fractions include genotoxic compounds. Modern labs can detect tiny traces. Food agencies urge manufacturers to curb sources by fixing packaging and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing contamination usually starts with packaging swaps, clean lubricants, tighter storage, and better supplier controls — changes consumers rarely see but benefit from quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why packaging and process matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft PVC and some flexible materials rely on plasticizers that can migrate into oil. Stainless steel, glass, and modern elastomers cut that risk. Recycled cardboard without functional barriers can release mineral oils. Ink set-offs from labels can migrate through plastic over time. Each small step in the chain matters: harvest crates, mills, pumps, tanks, fillers, caps, and pallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Smart buying without the stress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need lab gear to shop smarter. Build a simple routine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefer glass. If you must buy plastic, use it quickly and store cool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rotate brands that publish harvest dates and lot numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep one “finishing” oil for salads and a separate, sturdy oil (like Picual) for cooking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask your store about storage conditions. Shelves away from windows serve you better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extra context for frequent users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily users stack exposure from many fatty foods: dairy, spreads, nuts, sauces. Swapping one or two high-use items to glass-packed options cuts the total. If you cook for kids or pregnant people, prioritize dark glass bottles and fresh harvest oils. Stainless-steel bulk dispensers at reputable shops can also help, as long as they rotate stock fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious about your household’s risk profile? Track your high-fat purchases for a week. Note which come in plastic. Shift the top two to glass or tins on your next run. That small change usually delivers the biggest reduction with almost no sacrifice in flavor or price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article reflects the findings reported by 60 Millions de consommateurs on a panel of 24 oils. Brands may vary by lot and date. If a producer updates packaging or process, results can change fast, so keep an eye on fresh test data when it appears.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;A researcher at the University of Haifa says he has found that people diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes face a 50 percent higher risk of developing late-onset schizophrenia compared to people without diabetes. For women, the risk may be even higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Type 2 diabetes is already known to raise the risks of multiple health conditions, including heart disease and dementia,” said lead researcher Prof. Stephen Levine of Haifa’s School of Public Health, who recently spoke to The Times of Israel in a teleconference call. “Our findings show it also increases the risk of schizophrenia in middle and old age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researcher said the findings could allow early identification of high-risk individuals and lead to new protocols that include psychiatric monitoring and support as an integral part of diabetic patient care.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The study followed more than 99,000 Israelis aged 51 to 71, all members of Meuhedet Health Services and without a prior history of Type 2 diabetes or schizophrenia, from January 2005 to February 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It found that those with Type 2 diabetes were 50% more likely to develop schizophrenia than those who did not have the blood sugar disorder. Among women, the figure rose to 64%, while men were 39% more likely, Levine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Type 2 diabetes patients more likely to develop schizophrenia, Israeli researchers find"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted in collaboration with Prof. Arad Kodesh from Haifa’s Department of Community Mental Health and Meuhedet Health Services and Prof. Abraham Reichenberg from the Department of Psychiatry at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was published last month in the peer-reviewed Oxford University Press journal &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/advance-article/doi/10.1093/schbul/sbaf159/8253574"&gt;Schizophrenia Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The research might help prevent considerable suffering for patients and their families,” Levine said.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;h3&gt;Why diabetes might cause schizophrenia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levine said there are several reasons why Type 2 diabetes, also known as adult-onset diabetes, and late-onset schizophrenia sometimes occur together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the association might be due to the same genes in both conditions. One diabetes-related gene, TCF7L2, which helps control insulin release and blood-sugar regulation, has also been linked to higher schizophrenia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies find that people experiencing their first episode of psychosis often have unusual blood-sugar readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with diabetes often find it difficult to maintain healthy habits. Poor diet, lack of exercise, and poor sleep can worsen overall health, possibly making schizophrenia more likely. Some research suggests that the way the body reacts to stress could increase the risk for both Type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Mark Weiser, who has served as the chairman of the psychiatric division at Sheba Medical Center since 2006 and does research in schizophrenia, epidemiological studies and clinical trials, told The Times of Israel that the medications given to patients with schizophrenia are often associated with a risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, when a schizophrenia patient gets diabetes, we say it’s because of the medication,” Weiser said. “But these findings show something that’s exactly the opposite, which is very intriguing.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siblings of people with schizophrenia are more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes, and family histories of diabetes and schizophrenia tend to appear together, hinting at shared family risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In women, lower estrogen levels after midlife may also play a role in triggering schizophrenia at older ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levine said that medical teams who follow people with diabetes could give a brief psychological screening test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Investigating an unusual comorbidity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levine, who for the past 20 years has studied schizophrenia, including the risks of schizophrenia in Holocaust survivors, said that there is considerable scientific evidence showing that people with schizophrenia are at risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain antipsychotic medications used to treat schizophrenia can lead to changes in an individual’s metabolism, which could increase the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levine said that he thought, “There’s no reason for the association not to be the other way around.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nobody had ever researched that before,” said Levine, who was born in Scotland and moved to Israel in 1988. “I wanted to turn the research on its head.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes, which is often associated with obesity and a lack of exercise, is one of the most common chronic diseases in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;Characterized by high blood sugar levels and associated with damage to blood vessels, the heart, and the nervous system, the disease could cause blindness, kidney dysfunction and lead to limb amputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have linked rising rates of Type 2 diabetes worldwide to sharp growth in numbers of overweight individuals, as well as declines in physical activity and increased life expectancies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Israel, diabetes rates have risen slightly from 6.6% of the population in 2012 to 7.4% in 2023, the last year for which Health Ministry data is publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3038944" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2023/06/AP23146705997249.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3038944" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2023/06/AP23146705997249-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Two women stand on August 16, 2016, in New York. High body mass index, an indication that people could be overweight, was linked to more than half of deaths and disability from diabetes. (Mark Lennihan/AP)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, nearly 600 million people suffered from diabetes as of 2024, a number expected to surpass 850 million by 2050, with the highest prevalence expected in the Middle East and North Africa, according to the International Diabetes Federation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most worrying thing is that diabetes is clearly on an increase worldwide,” Levine said. “There are major contributing factors to the disease which are preventable, many of which are lifestyle factors, including diet and physical activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects about 1% of the population around the world, including in Israel. Onset usually starts when people are in their early 20s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People with the disorder have hallucinations, they have delusions, confusion, and cognitive disorder,” Levine said.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;He explained that after the disorder’s onset, it “[persists across] one’s lifespan, incurring functional impairments, occupational impairments, as well as social and family stigma and challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is rare for people to develop schizophrenia in middle age, Levine said. There were approximately 1.2 cases of adult onset schizophrenia per 100,000 people per year among those without diabetes during the time of his study. However, among people with Type 2 diabetes, there were about 2.6 cases of adult onset schizophrenia per 100,000 people per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[Since] we know that people with diabetes suffer from more depression,” Levine said, “there’s no harm in doctors adding a couple of questions to probe patients’ psychotic experiences to be aware of a potential issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Identifying psychosis early in adults with diabetes could reduce patient suffering,” he said. “At the same time, it could help relieve some of the burden of caregivers.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There's a parasite living in the brains of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-us-still-doesnt-test-for-this-common-harmful-parasite-during-pregnancy"&gt;40 million Americans&lt;/a&gt;, and most of these human hosts are completely unaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors don't usually treat this bug unless it begins wreaking havoc on the bodies of patients with weakened immune systems, but a new discovery may make short work of the invader without the typical risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parasitologist Rajshekhar Gaji runs a lab at the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, investigating what makes the parasite, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cat-parasite-can-seriously-disrupt-brain-function-study-suggests"&gt;Cat Parasite Can Seriously Disrupt Brain Function, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The parasite that's sitting in the brain gets reactivated, starts multiplying, and then it's fatal," Gaji &lt;a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/10/vetmed-research-parasite.html"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;. "Because of that, the parasite is a dreaded pathogen." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;T. gondii &lt;/em&gt;is closely associated with cats, which are the only known hosts within which the parasite can reproduce sexually. But once its offspring are shed in the cat's poop, there are very few warm-blooded species &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt; won't make a home in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of us, an infection with &lt;em&gt;T. gondii &lt;/em&gt;will fall &lt;span&gt;completely&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;under the radar. For those with cancer, HIV, or who are on immunosuppressants, the parasite presents significant risks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a healthy immune system to keep &lt;em&gt;T. gondii &lt;/em&gt;at bay, these patients can quickly develop a disease known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis"&gt;toxoplasmosis&lt;/a&gt;, which can bring flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph nodes, and brain inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite can also be transmitted to the placenta of a developing fetus during pregnancy. This form of the disease, congenital toxoplasmosis, can cause developmental problems, and even miscarriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatments for acute toxoplasmosis involve medications that target mechanisms in the parasite that are biologically similar to processes in our own bodies. This often puts patients at risk of severe side effects, restricting treatments to situations where infections are considered to be dire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaji and his team might have found a lead, though: in a new study, they&lt;span&gt; have shown that switching off just a single protein inside the microscopic parasite can kill it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein, &lt;span&gt;TgAP2X-7, appears to be essential to the parasite's ability to invade a host, form plaques, and self-replicate. To prove this, the team genetically modified some parasites so that their TgAP2X-7 proteins function normally unless &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxin"&gt;auxin&lt;/a&gt; (a plant hormone that regulates growth) is added, in which case the proteins would quickly degrade. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Auxin, they established prior, had no impact on &lt;em&gt;T. gondii &lt;/em&gt;growth or plaque formation on its own, so any effect it had on the genetically modified parasites could be attributed to the fact that the TgAP2X-7 proteins had been destroyed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deprived of &lt;span&gt;TgAP2X-7, the parasites couldn't form plaques, and their ability to invade hosts (which, in this lab study, were human foreskin cells) was severely impaired. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Usually, they have a near-100 percent success rate invading these kinds of cells, but without that key protein, success dropped to below 50 percent. They also struggled to replicate.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178106" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178106" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-642x256.jpg" alt="Scientists Have Found The Protein Switch That Drives Widespread Brain Parasite" class="wp-image-178106 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-642x256.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-1200x478.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-768x306.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-1536x612.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-600x239.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004.jpg 1877w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178106" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Strains that had their TgAP2X-7 destroyed (B) were unable to propagate at the same rate as those with the protein intact (A).

        &lt;p&gt;The spooky season is upon us, and it’s time to put together those Halloween costumes. If you’re dressing up as a vampire, a zombie, or a creepy skull, then you’re likely in the market for colored contact lenses to elevate your look. But before you add those bloody red contacts to your cart, be sure they won’t result in a real scare later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Novelty contact lenses can be an extreme risk, leading to severe irritation or discomfort, eye infections, and sometimes even vision impairment or blindness, experts have warned. In order to avoid those risks, there are a few things to keep in mind when buying novelty contact lenses.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Keep an eye out&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Halloween costumes are worn once a year, so people typically tend not to splurge on those gnarly fits. Even if your costume is cheap (I’m not judging), make sure those contacts aren’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Halloween approaches, novelty contact lenses are sold all over the internet and at costume stores. However, it’s best to purchase contact lenses at a reputable store that’s more likely to have been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If you can’t buy contact lenses from your eye doctor, then look for a reliable online retailer that requires a prescription. Previous &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/news/costume-contacts-may-contain-chemicals"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that over-the-counter cosmetic lenses contain chlorine and other harmful chemicals used for tint or color, which can lead to infections. These infections can sometimes lead to more serious issues such as vision impairment, cataracts, and secondary glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Researchers also warn that the colorants used for novelty contacts create an uneven texture, which can scratch your eyes and increase the risk of infections that may lead to blindness, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Also, since the contact lenses are not fitted to your eyes, they can lead to scarring, corneal abrasions, and ulcers.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If you’re using contact lenses for the first time, do not store them in water but instead keep them in a clean case filled with a specialized solution for disinfection. You should also not store them for an extended period of time, and make sure you clean out the case periodically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s also this handy &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/halloween-cosplay-colorful-contacts-eye-safety"&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; on how to wear contacts safely. With all that in mind, make sure the only scare you get on Halloween is from the gruesome outfits and not the safety of your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gizmodo</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOUXpXUjlQOU92NHY2THFuWXhQOGNRNUxVS2xXb01ZbTQ1RUtSS1ZjNFBIV2NOTDJBOTlqWjN5Uzc2VnBjR0hPNEJubGk0VUJrVjVIVlVYNFhrdGtySlR1SGpCWmJOTm1ac2hfR2d4UEk3V29fbFVQZE94Q1NBY1V1cGxIUmZvM3JWZWxXQ284MDNsS1FUTndQbDhtVXhKOTA4OENMVldEVERUa0FaSE8xS2tR</guid></item><item><title>男性正面临睾丸激素危机-这15项修复措施将增强必需激素- BikeRadar</title><link>https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/health/men-are-facing-a-testosterone-crisis-these-15-fixes-will-turbocharge-the-essential-hormone</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div _ngcontent-purplestorefront-c2920483845 class="purple-inner-container purple-content-body-inner"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testosterone is critical for the health and athletic performance of men (and women). So it is troubling that multiple studies suggest men’s testosterone levels are tanking worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp;amp; Metabolism&lt;/em&gt; traced a “substantial” drop in men’s testosterone levels since 1987, at a rate of 1% each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another paper in &lt;em&gt;European Urology Focus&lt;/em&gt; found that 20% of younger men now have low testosterone levels. What is happening? And is this cause for mass male panic?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern men – particularly athletes with a keen interest in physical performance – deserve an urgent hormonal health update, beginning with a clarification of why testosterone matters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving growth through early life, in adulthood it supports everything from sperm production to red blood cell creation, muscle strength, bone density, memory performance and energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/GettyImages-1124672639.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945056"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Testosterone helps red blood cell production – crucial to endurance athletes such as cyclists. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A worldwide drop, then, is bad news for men’s health, with studies linking it to heart problems, obesity, high cholesterol, diabetes, anaemia, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, erectile dysfunction, infertility and sleep disturbances, plus mental issues such as irritability, low energy, poor self-esteem and weak concentration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, low testosterone is now associated with a 35-40% higher risk of premature death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explanations for this disturbing global decline range from the ageing population to sedentary jobs and the side-effects of drugs such as antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But almost all experts agree the drop is linked primarily to unhealthy modern lifestyles and the rise in obesity and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seminal European Male Ageing study found that 2.1% of men aged 40-79 suffer from medically low testosterone (low enough to require treatment), but another 20% experience sub-optimal testosterone levels (not low enough to require medical treatment, but still likely to impair their everyday health). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for most of those men, low testosterone was linked to existing health problems, such as obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It fits the narrative that worldwide we are overall less healthy than we were,” explains Dr Channa Jayasena, a specialist in reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The men with the lowest levels of testosterone tended to be the ones who are the least fit, who have obesity, who are on the most medications or who are most ill.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, for most modern men with low testosterone, the issue is the result – not the cause – of their other health problems. “To a certain extent, you can lower your chances of low testosterone by incorporating health promotion into your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In medical terms, low testosterone is diagnosed through a combination of blood tests and symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A normal level ranges from around 8-10 nmol/L (nanomoles per litre) of blood to 30-31nmol/L. And symptoms include fatigue, depression, anxiety, irritability, low libido, erectile dysfunction, reduced strength, night sweats and poor memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low testosterone can be caused by genetic conditions, injuries and hormonal disorders. But for most men, lifestyle factors appear to be the primary cause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that men do experience a natural but harmless drop in testosterone as they age, at a rate of 2-3% per year, from the age of 30 onwards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/GettyImages-2218546877.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945062"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Testosterone declines naturally (and harmlessly) with age, but early and more consequential drops need addressing. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the oft-cited media term ‘male menopause’ is misleading. All menstruating women experience the menopause, which involves a rapid decline in hormone levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most men do not suffer from low testosterone, while most age-related hormonal changes are slow and inconsequential. “You shouldn’t expect to be the same man at 80 as you were at 18,” says Dr Jayasena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are one of the 2.1% of men who have medically low testosterone levels, help is available through the NHS in the form of testosterone injections, gels or patches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you are among the 20% of modern men who have sub-optimal testosterone levels (low but not requiring medical intervention), positive lifestyle changes can help you get back on track. Here are 15 science-backed strategies to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Blast belly fat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/GettyImages-1205492768.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945078"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Belly fat increases your chances of low testosterone. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that obesity is a major cause of low testosterone. That is because body fat contains an enzyme that converts testosterone into the female sex hormone, oestrogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, one American research paper found that every one-point increase in a man’s Body Mass Index (BMI) is associated with a 2% decrease in testosterone. Gynecomastia – the medical term for ‘man boobs’ – is one sign of this hormonal imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes the solution pretty simple: from cutting down on saturated fats in your diet, to cranking up your fat-burning workouts, losing body fat can revitalise your testosterone levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reassuring study by the Endocrine Society found that when 900 overweight men shed weight, they slashed their chances of low testosterone by 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Lift dumbbells&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifting weights will crank up your testosterone, according to a study in the Asian Journal of Sports Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-muscle compound movements such as squats and deadlifts are particularly effective, according to Pennsylvania State University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lifting heavy weights at 80-85% of your one-rep max also works well, according to the University of Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the good news is that any weight training will help. A study in the journal &lt;em&gt;Human Reproduction&lt;/em&gt; found that even moderate-intensity weight training elevates testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the results can be fast: a Spanish study found that men who did strength training three days a week enjoyed elevated testosterone levels after just four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Crank up the cardio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Routine cardiovascular exercise will elevate your hormonal health and burn off testosterone-wrecking body fat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Japanese study found that men who engaged in aerobic exercise for up to 90 minutes per day, three times per week, experienced a rise in testosterone after just 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;HIIT your hormones hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/11-02-07CYP414_201123ss7254-scaled.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945085"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;High intensity turbo sessions are a recipe for testosterone building. &lt;span&gt;Steve Sayers/Our Media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-intensity interval training (HIIT), such as 10x 30-second sprints or sweaty indoor spin classes, will protect your hormones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paper in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Medicine&lt;/em&gt; found that three HIIT sessions a week spiked testosterone by 36% after only eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Follow the Mediterranean diet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite wacky claims in dark corners of the internet, there is no magic food ingredient that will boost your testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a healthy overall diet will protect your hormonal health. A study in &lt;em&gt;Current Research In Food Science&lt;/em&gt; found that men who adopted a Mediterranean diet significantly increased their testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on fruit, veg, whole grains, fish, lean meat and healthy fats such as olive oil, avocado and nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dodge inflammatory food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/GettyImages-1391487524.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945089"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Regular highly processed food is a testosterone killer. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protect your testosterone by cutting down on inflammatory foods, such as processed foods, high-glycaemic-index food (such as refined carbohydrates) and saturated fat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; linked a high consumption of pastries, desserts and takeaways with low testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Eat more oily fish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all fat is bad. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in salmon, mackerel and sardines, have been shown to help with testosterone synthesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These fatty acids support cell membranes in the testes, where testosterone is produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Don’t get too skinny&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endurance athletes beware: shifting excess body fat is good for your hormonal health, but turning yourself into a skeleton is not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testosterone is produced from cholesterol, and severe calorie restriction will impair its production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study by the Universities of Worcester and Warwick found a strong link between low-fat diets and low testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Get some daily vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/CYP_bigride_Guernsey_-100-scaled.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945090"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Plenty of sun exposure means cyclists needn't worry about vitamin D levels. &lt;span&gt;Joseph Branston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news for cyclists and runners: several studies link outdoor exercise with healthy testosterone levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be because it boosts vitamin D – the ‘sunshine vitamin’ which is produced when skin is exposed to sunlight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research in the journal&lt;em&gt; Hormone and Metabolic Research &lt;/em&gt;has linked healthy vitamin D levels to higher testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over winter, consider using a supplement: a study in the &lt;em&gt;World Journal of Men’s Health&lt;/em&gt; linked vitamin D supplements with increased testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Zero in on zinc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc, an essential mineral found in red meat, poultry, beans, oats, eggs, nuts and grains, supports healthy testosterone production, which is why research in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; found low zinc levels are linked to a drop in testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most men can get enough zinc from a balanced diet. But consider a supplement if your diet is zinc-deficient: research suggests vegetarians and vegans are most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cut back on booze&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad news for boozers: testosterone levels can drop within just 30 minutes of consuming alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian research found that heavy drinking disrupts the body’s hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activity, and causes inflammation and oxidative stress, leading to a decline in testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stick to the NHS guidelines of no more than 14 units (6 pints of 4% beer) per week. But the less, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Eat more green leafy veg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make your dinner plate greener. Cruciferous vegetables – such as broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale and brussels sprouts – contain the phytonutrient indole-3-carbinol (I3C), which helps the body eliminate estradiol – a testosterone-damaging oestrogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Get 7-8 hours of sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testosterone and sleep are intertwined. Most testosterone release occurs during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a lack of sleep also releases the stress hormone cortisol, which blocks testosterone production. The University of Chicago found that men who got only five hours of sleep suffered a 10-15% drop in testosterone the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/CYP_PBP_JB_-34-scaled.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945094"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Clocking up big mileage means cyclists can often fall sleep any time, any place. &lt;span&gt;Joseph Branston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improve your sleep by sticking to a regular sleep routine: research in Andrology found that 7-8 hours per night is a healthy target for middle-aged men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Learn to chill&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not just a bad night’s kip that will mangle your testosterone levels: research in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Molecular Bioscience&lt;/em&gt; found stress also spikes the testosterone-hampering hormone cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So whether you tune into classical radio or enjoy walks in the park, allocate dedicated time each day to soothing your frazzled mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Don’t overtrain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise supports hormonal health, but don’t overdo it with extreme endurance training or excessive HIIT workouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study in Andrology found that recreational athletes who trained 4-5 hours per week enjoy better hormonal health than elite athletes who train 4-5 days per week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always bank plenty of rest days: your hormones depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;

When animals eat other animals, the heavier nitrogen-15 slowly builds up in their bodies. That means animals that eat meat have more nitrogen-15 than plant eaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In most Neanderthal specimens that have been analyzed, the nitrogen-15 content was higher than those measured in large carnivores, such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/extinct-species/oldest-evidence-of-neanderthals-hunting-cave-lions-dates-to-48000-years-ago-punctured-bones-reveal" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/animals/extinct-species/oldest-evidence-of-neanderthals-hunting-cave-lions-dates-to-48000-years-ago-punctured-bones-reveal"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cave lions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, cave hyenas or wolves," Bocherens told Live Science in an email. "The conclusion was that Neanderthals were 'more carnivore than the carnivores' (hypercarnivores)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he added, this interpretation is too simple. Nitrogen levels can vary depending on which animals Neanderthals ate, not just how much meat they consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/56678-woolly-mammoth-facts.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/56678-woolly-mammoth-facts.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Woolly mammoths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; consistently exhibit the highest nitrogen-15 levels among herbivores, probably due to the consumption of plants with high nitrogen-15 levels," Bocherens said. The data suggest that Neanderthals were predators that consumed a higher proportion of mammoths than they did of other carnivores in the ecosystem, Bocherens added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt7466" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt7466" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2025 study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; offered a different explanation for Neanderthals' unusually high nitrogen-15 levels: They may have eaten maggots, either by accident, in the process of eating rotting meat, or on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both rotting meat and especially maggots feasting on the rotting meat have high nitrogen levels and any Neandertal eating those foods regularly would have an isotopic signature that is off the charts," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/anthropology/faculty-staff/faculty-profiles/nowell-april.php" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/anthropology/faculty-staff/faculty-profiles/nowell-april.php" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;April Nowell&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Paleolithic archaeologist and professor of anthropology at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But could Neanderthals survive on a solely meat-based diet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="2d0e5b8e-eb3a-407e-8f72-b61e89a7c34a"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Archaeologists have found evidence that Neanderthals soaked, pounded and ground lentils, nuts and grasses at Shanidar Cave (pictured here) in what is now Iraq and Franchthi Cave in modern-day Greece. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: ISMAEL ADNAN via Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="1e9c1f72-9a55-4eec-888e-745860bb5aa0"&gt;"They could not if they had a similar physiology as modern humans, which is likely," Bocherens said. "There is a need for dietary sources of energy." Eating too much protein without enough fat and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/51976-carbohydrates.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/51976-carbohydrates.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;carbohydrates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which supply most of our energy, can lead to a fatal condition known as protein poisoning or "rabbit starvation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their solution, scientists think, was fat.

The US Preventive Services Task Force (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/prostate-cancer-screening" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;USPSTF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;) currently recommends against routine PSA testing in this age group. The PSA test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in the blood, which can be a sign of prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main reason for this recommendation is that prostate cancer often grows very slowly. Many older men are more likely to live with the disease rather than die from it. Treatments can also cause side effects such as urinary problems, fatigue, or sexual difficulties. According to the USPSTF, these harms may outweigh the benefits of detecting the disease early in older men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Prostate Cancer Guide: Expert Reveals Causes and Prevention Strategies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as men today are living longer and healthier lives, some experts believe these guidelines need updating. The last update was in 2018, and new recommendations are expected soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is &lt;keyword id="21207229" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Metastatic-prostate-cancer" source="Orion"&gt;metastatic prostate cancer&lt;/keyword&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metastatic prostate cancer is prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland to other parts of the body. Prostate cancer usually begins in the prostate, a small gland in men that produces seminal fluid. In its early stages, the cancer is generally confined to the prostate and often grows slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the cancer becomes metastatic, it spreads to other areas of the body through the blood or lymphatic system. The most common sites for metastasis are the bones, lymph nodes, and sometimes the lungs or liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metastatic prostate cancer is more serious than localised cancer because it can affect other organs and cause symptoms such as bone pain, fatigue, urinary problems, and weight loss. Treatment usually focuses on slowing the cancer’s growth, managing symptoms, and extending life, rather than curing the disease, although recent advances in therapy are improving outcomes significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When should men over 70 be tested for prostate cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it is not routine, some men over 70 still have PSA tests. This usually happens after discussing the pros and cons with their doctor. Often, testing is done when symptoms appear, such as trouble urinating, tiredness, or bone pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Marc B. Garnick, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, explains that it is not uncommon to find advanced prostate cancer in older men through these tests. In many cases, the disease has already spread by the time symptoms appear. This highlights the importance of making screening decisions individually, based on a man’s overall health and life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What tests are done after a positive PSA result&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a PSA test suggests that cancer may be present, the next step is usually a prostate needle biopsy. This involves taking small samples of prostate tissue to check for cancer cells. Doctors also perform a digital rectal examination (DRE) to feel for any lumps or changes in the size or shape of the prostate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern imaging technology now plays an important role in diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can provide clear, detailed pictures of the prostate. This allows doctors to identify suspicious areas more accurately and take targeted biopsy samples. MRI-guided biopsies are becoming a preferred method because they improve accuracy and help avoid unnecessary procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Understanding how aggressive prostate cancer is&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once prostate cancer is confirmed, doctors study the cancer cells under a microscope to see how aggressive they are. This helps them understand how quickly the cancer may grow and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many years, doctors used the Gleason score to grade prostate cancer. This score ranges from 6 to 10, based on how abnormal the cells look. A score of 6 suggests a slow-growing cancer, while a score of 9 or 10 points to a more dangerous, fast-growing type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A newer system now groups cancers into five Grade Groups. Grade Group 1 represents the least aggressive cancer, while Grade Group 5 represents the most aggressive form. This simpler system helps patients better understand their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors can also order genetic tests to look for inherited mutations, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2. Men with these mutations are more likely to develop aggressive prostate cancer. These genes are also linked to breast and ovarian cancers, so results can have important implications for family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Detecting the spread of prostate cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out if prostate cancer has spread, doctors use imaging scans. In the past, CT scans and bone scans were commonly used to check the lymph nodes and bones. Today, more advanced tests like the PSMA scan are used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen) scan is more sensitive and can find very small clusters of cancer cells that other scans may miss. This test looks for a protein that appears in large amounts on the surface of prostate cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on scan results, doctors classify the cancer as high-volume or low-volume metastatic disease, depending on how much it has spread. If only a few small areas of cancer are found, it is described as oligometastatic prostate cancer, which often responds better to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treatment options for metastatic prostate cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating metastatic prostate cancer usually involves combining several therapies to stop the cancer from growing and spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main approach is known as doublet therapy, which uses two different drugs that reduce or block testosterone. Testosterone is a hormone that prostate cancer cells need to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As reported by Harvard Health, the first drug, leuprolide (Lupron), stops the body from making testosterone. The second drug comes from a group known as androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs). These medicines, such as enzalutamide (Xtandi), darolutamide (Nubeqa), apalutamide (Erleada), or abiraterone (Zytiga), block testosterone from attaching to cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the disease continues to spread, doctors may add chemotherapy to create a stronger treatment known as triplet therapy. This approach combines hormonal and chemotherapy drugs to fight cancer on multiple fronts. Some men begin triplet therapy right away if their cancer is widespread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Improving survival and managing health during metastatic prostate cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, metastatic prostate cancer was seen as a fatal condition. However, major progress in diagnosis and treatment has changed that outlook. Today, many men live 10 years or longer with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are also finding benefits in treating the prostate gland itself, even after cancer has spread. Radiating the prostate can slow disease progression and improve survival, which was not considered a standard option in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These advances have turned metastatic prostate cancer into a more manageable long-term condition rather than an immediate life-threatening illness. Before starting hormone-based treatments, doctors recommend a heart and cardiovascular evaluation. Hormonal therapies can increase the risk of heart problems, so it is important to monitor blood pressure, cholesterol, and overall heart health during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing these risks through regular check-ups, diet, and exercise can help patients stay healthier throughout their cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/lung-cancer-symptoms-on-fingers-finger-clubbing-nail-changes-and-other-warning-signs-that-could-indicate-serious-health-risks/articleshow/124780487.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Lung cancer symptoms on fingers: Finger clubbing, nail changes and other warning signs that could indicate serious health risks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 06:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwJBVV95cUxQaE9rcks3aVNyZXpwdjhRd05yaThDMzZaeWl1WFZFZC12Qm1iS1MyN0dRdl8yOFRrXy1SQ1hQbUFKLWdNSjJXd2pyN1pmSGpWcjJlbVpvVmRaX1BXVDluRWtET09taThjbzl3bllwS3gwMWo5SzY4ZGp4MWZSc1ZvWU5BZzRfWUJRUFYtbXpLdWdvU3I0X243dUgtck5RamhOQ2p1cjYxZ09mN2ZFWElHRGlSaWVGUXhVUXFycWxyaFJGM3FyMDUtM21jUjQ0MkdPQ0FIMDhReTR6SkFBbk8xQUFOdGR1WnFMSXRTSmJ0d3hYeFp2NHFQVl9tRVA1ZXQtNERkdUNtY2tKOU16ZkxnaVZsQk5FZlVSMkg4dnoyTEFSMUE0Q2xlNFNNaXM1azJtSy1MNXV1cmM4OGZWR0JnTGs1WXdURDA</guid></item><item><title>以色列两岁儿童死于麻疹疫情-《耶路撒冷邮报》</title><link>https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/article-871616</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Jerusalem Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 06:03:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE5BbWtDeHkxcGF4eE95cWpTaEVpMHZLeHZiTFhQWUVSNlFDX0gxS2YwcjhZcVpXdmljRERGZTBMRXRTWEZGR1Jsd3BxOFlXNUtDT1YwWkV2ck42em5XcF9Wc1BQQ184UU0</guid></item><item><title>维生素K ：被遗忘的维生素，让您的骨骼强壮，心脏安全-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/vitamin-k-the-forgotten-vitamin-that-keeps-your-bones-strong-and-heart-safe/articleshow/124815991.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K rarely makes health headlines, yet it plays a crucial role in keeping both your bones and heart strong. Beyond helping blood clot, it ensures calcium goes where it should, into your bones, not your arteries.

According to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/ask-the-doctor-do-people-on-warfarin-need-to-avoid-vitamin-supplements-that-contain-vitamin-k" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Harvard Health Publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the goal isn’t to avoid vitamin K-rich foods like spinach, kale, or broccoli, but to keep intake consistent so your blood's clotting level (INR) remains stable. Newer anticoagulants such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran don't interact with vitamin K, but anyone on warfarin should always consult their doctor before making dietary or supplement changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin K and bone health: The missing link&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K works with Vitamin D and calcium to strengthen bones.

Low Vitamin K levels reduce osteocalcin activity, weakening bones even when calcium intake is adequate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutritionists now consider Vitamin K an essential but often missing piece of most bone-health plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The takeaway on Vitamin K and overall health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K quietly keeps two vital systems balanced: blood clotting and calcium regulation.

However, according to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/counting-steps-is-good-is-combining-steps-and-heart-rate-better-202504173095" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Harvard Health Publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, that number wasn’t based on scientific research but originated from a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan. Recent studies suggest that even 4,000 to 7,000 steps per day can improve health and lower the risk of early death. While step counts are helpful, they don’t reflect the intensity or effort of activity. A brisk uphill walk can raise heart rate far more than a slow flat stroll, even if step counts are identical. This is why experts recommend combining step counts with heart rate measurements to get a more accurate picture of fitness and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Combining steps and heart rate: The science behind a new fitness metric&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40156587/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; explored whether combining heart rate and step data could offer a more accurate assessment of fitness and disease risk. The researchers developed a new measure called the daily heart rate per step (DHRPS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ratio combines two pieces of information easily collected by most smartwatches or fitness bands: your average daily heart rate and your average daily step count. To calculate your DHRPS, divide your heart rate by your step count. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart rate 80 bpm / 4,000 steps = 0.0200&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart rate 80 bpm / 6,000 steps = 0.0133&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this ratio, lower scores indicate better cardiovascular fitness, as they show your heart needs fewer beats to support your activity level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study found: Higher DHRPS means higher disease risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved nearly 7,000 participants, with an average age of 55, all wearing Fitbit devices that continuously tracked their heart rate and steps over five years, a total of more than 50 billion steps. When researchers compared participants’ DHRPS ratios with their health outcomes, they found strong associations between higher DHRPS scores and an increased risk of chronic diseases, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure (hypertension)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coronary artery disease and heart failure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stroke&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with lower DHRPS values tended to report better overall health, while those with higher values performed worse on exercise stress tests, showing poorer endurance. In short, your DHRPS score could be a better indicator of how efficiently your heart supports physical activity than steps or heart rate alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding your DHRPS score and what it reveals about your heart and overall health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers categorised DHRPS results into three groups:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low: 0.0081 or lower (best cardiovascular fitness)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medium: between 0.0081 and 0.0147&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High: 0.0147 or higher (higher disease risk)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lower DHRPS score means your heart works more efficiently relative to your movement. For example, if your DHRPS drops from 0.0200 to 0.0133 after a few weeks of increased walking, that’s a sign your fitness is improving. However, it’s important to remember that this is a new and emerging measure. The study only shows correlation, not causation, meaning it can’t prove that improving your DHRPS will directly lower your risk of heart disease or diabetes. Moreover, the research primarily involved white female participants and didn’t compare DHRPS with established risk factors like cholesterol, smoking, or family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you already wear a smartwatch or fitness tracker, calculating your DHRPS could give you a more complete view of your health and motivate you to move more efficiently. It’s a simple ratio, yet it may reveal how your heart and activity work together to influence long-term well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientists still need more research to confirm its medical value, this approach reflects a key insight: fitness isn’t just about how far you move, but how your heart responds as you move. By monitoring both steps and heart rate, you can personalise your fitness journey and identify trends that might help prevent disease. In the end, whether you’re aiming for 5,000 or 10,000 steps, focus on staying active, maintaining a healthy heart rate, and making steady progress. The combination of movement and heart awareness could be your best step yet toward lasting health and vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

You don’t need 15 supplements, cold plunges every morning, or to cut out every ‘bad’ food to protect your heart and stay young. You need to understand your body — and the root causes of why it’s slowing down, inflamed, or running on empty.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;‘Your body isn’t failing you. It’s trying to get your attention’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cardiologist highlighted that after over 20+ years in medicine, he has seen the same story repeat itself: “High-performing people, business owners, parents, athletes — running on caffeine, stress, and convenience, until their body finally says no more.” It is because people forget to find the root cause of their problems, Dr Bhojraj stressed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Therefore, the cardiologist stressed that if you’re: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always tired, even after sleep. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experiencing chest pressure, shortness of breath, or anxiety that feels ‘different’.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foggy, inflamed, or just not feeling like yourself anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using quick fixes to get through the day instead of actually healing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;He highlighted that all of these are not signs that your body is failing you; rather, it’s trying to get your attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The truth is, your heart health isn’t just about cholesterol or blood pressure. It’s about inflammation, hormones, gut health, sleep quality, stress response — all interconnected,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Therefore, he emphasised that it is essential to combine advanced diagnostics, personalised functional medicine, and decades of cardiology expertise to help people regain their vitality from the inside out. “Because health isn’t about doing more. It’s about doing what’s right for you,” the cardiologist said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

For many, the way their brains work means they struggle with tasks that require focus and planning, which, at the lower end, means daily stress and inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, it's a recipe for disaster. For example, a&lt;span&gt;dults with ADHD are more at risk &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7015-10-99"&gt;road accidents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7215254/"&gt;motor vehicle injuries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2810131"&gt;traffic tickets, and hard braking events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies have found that stimulant medications, such as Ritalin, can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/adhd-medication-could-literally-add-years-to-some-peoples-lives"&gt;literally add years to some people's lives&lt;/a&gt;. These stimulants &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-do-stimulants-actually-work-to-reduce-adhd-symptoms-215801"&gt;increase the amount of key neurotransmitters&lt;/a&gt; in the brain, and improve attention, impulse control and decision-making.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study adds &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7015-10-99"&gt;further evidence&lt;/a&gt; that these drugs can tackle some of the most serious outcomes people with ADHD face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the &lt;span&gt;Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden led the study, drawing on data from 148,581 patients, ranging from 6 to 64-years-old, who received an ADHD diagnosis between 2007 and 2018. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who started drug treatment (about 57 percent) within three months of diagnosis saw reduced risk across most of the serious outcomes assessed. In about 88 percent of cases, the drug they took was methylphenidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medication reduced the risk of first-time substance misuse by 15 percent, and recurrent misuse by 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reduced first-time suicidal behavior by 17 percent, and subsequent suicide attempts by 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First instances of criminal behavior were reduced by 13 percent, and repeat instances, by 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found medication reduced the risk of first-time traffic accidents by 12 percent, and recurrent events by 16 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Oftentimes there is no information on what the risks are if you don't treat ADHD," study author and psychiatrist Samuele Cortese, from the University of Southampton, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr2j792drro"&gt;told journalist Philippa Roxby at the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Now we have evidence they [ADHD medications] can reduce these risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2024-083658"&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If this story has raised concerns or you need to talk to someone, &lt;a href="http://www.suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html"&gt;please consult this list to find a 24/7 crisis hotline in your country, and reach out for help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The clocks slide back, evenings close in, and the air smells faintly of damp leaves and bus stop brakes. Meals get rushed. Screens glow longer. We crave something warm, heavy, honest. Not a complicated feast. Just food that quiets the nerves and feels like a hand on your shoulder. Root vegetables do that. Not in a flashy way, not with fireworks. With a slow steadiness that matches the season’s pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market’s tarpaulin snapped in the wind, and the October drizzle misted everything into a soft film. A boy weighed muddy carrots on a squeaky scale while his mum tucked parsnips under her arm like a bouquet. I watched a farmer scrub a potato with a brush that had seen better decades, then slice the skin thin enough to lace light through it. When he handed me a sliver, it tasted like rain and stone and something faintly sweet. Not thrilling. Reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874125"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back home, I tipped a sack of beets on the counter and it thudded like a little drum. The room filled with that iron-rich scent of soil. I sliced, tossed, roasted, and set a bowl on the kitchen table that warmed my palms. Eating felt less like fuelling up and more like returning to a village you half remember. Why do roots feel so stabilising?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why roots steady us in autumn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can say it’s carbs, and you wouldn’t be wrong. But it’s not a sugar rush. It’s a gentle slope. Roots like carrots, swede and beetroot carry fibre that slows the ride and keeps blood sugar from yawing about. That quiet steadiness matters when the light fades mid-afternoon and we’re a bit frayed round the edges. There’s also the weight of it — the bowl in your hands, the fork scraping a tray — that signals the body to drop anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874126"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a Tuesday in Hackney: Julia, who cycles to work, swapped her brittle lunchtime salad for warm roasted roots and lentils. Nothing fancy — carrot coins, fennel seeds, a squeeze of lemon. Her afternoon cravings dialled down. She didn’t bounce from flat white to flat white. One small, n=1 experiment, yes. Still, it chimes with the data: root veg typically carry 2–6g of fibre per 100g and a raft of minerals like potassium, which plays peacekeeper with fluid balance and muscle function. The effect is quieter, not sleepy. More steady than slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a seasonal logic at play. As daylight thins, our routines tilt indoors, movement often narrows, and the nervous system can run a tad hot. Solid, warm, slightly sweet foods nudge the parasympathetic side — the body’s “rest and digest” setting. You feel full in a way that’s not about fullness alone. It’s about being satisfied. Roots speak to **steady energy**, and to a human pattern older than streetlights: harvest, store, take your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874128"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to cook for grounding, not just comfort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a tray method that rarely misses. Heat the oven to 200°C with the tray inside. Cut a mix — carrots, parsnips, beetroot, red onions — into chunks about the size of a pound coin in thickness. Toss with olive oil, flaky salt, cracked pepper, and a crushed clove of garlic per person. Slide the veg onto the hot tray so it sizzles on contact. Roast 20 minutes, shake, roast 15 more. Finish with a splash of red wine vinegar and chopped herbs. The vinegar wakes everything up without making it sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common slips? Peeling away flavour and nutrients — a good scrub often beats a peel. Overcrowding the tray so veg steam instead of crisp. Forgetting to season early and late. And storage matters: keep potatoes in a dark, cool spot in a breathable bag; keep onions apart from them; refrigerate beetroot once trimmed. We’ve all had that moment when the week collapses and dinner becomes toast and a piece of cheese. Let’s be honest: nobody does roasting trays and three sides every night. Aim for one little win — a pan of roots in the fridge turns into bowls, wraps, omelettes, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874129"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you want food to do more than fill a hole, it helps to think in textures and temperatures, not just flavours. Pair creamy mash with something crunchy, or hot wedges with a cool yoghurt sauce. That contrast lands beautifully on tired days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Roots are like batteries for slow days — you charge quietly, then get on with your life,” a grower in Somerset told me, brushing soil from a beet the colour of a low sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick grounding ideas: carrot ribbons with tahini and lemon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Five-minute mash: buttered swede with white pepper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brothy beet and barley soup with dill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roasted parsnips with miso glaze.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warm new potatoes, mustard, and capers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="3 EASY Ways We Store Vegetables Through Winter" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omBn1OSwSHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Autumn plates as a way of feeling at home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if dinner wasn’t a performance, but a place to land? Roots invite that kind of cooking. They wait for you. They forgive timing. You can roast them while you fold laundry or send the email you’ve delayed all day. You can turn leftovers into tomorrow’s frittata, or blitz them into a soup that smells like a small pub fire after rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking about the way the farmer’s knife let light through the potato slice. There’s something devotional in small, repetitive kitchen tasks. Scrubbing, chopping, stirring. *They put your hands to work so your mind can stretch out and breathe.* A pot bubbling like a steady conversation. A tray that crackles when you open the oven door. Not spectacular, just right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So try one little ritual this week: a bag of carrots and a fennel bulb, or a knobbly celeriac you haven’t used since last winter. See what happens when the house fills with that sweet, earthy perfume. Maybe you’ll eat in silence. Maybe you’ll text a friend a photo of your ridiculous purple beet hands. Maybe you’ll notice that **the pull of the ground** is not a metaphor at all, but a bowl of roasted roots on your lap while the wind rattles the letterbox. There’s **quiet joy** in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Fibre + lenteur&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Roots offer 2–6g fibre per 100g and a lower, steadier energy release&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fewer spikes and slumps; longer, calmer focus&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Preheated tray at 200°C, don’t overcrowd, finish with acid and herbs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Reliable flavour and texture without fuss&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FAQ :&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which root vegetables are best for “grounding” meals?&lt;/strong&gt;Go for a mix: carrots for sweetness, parsnips for perfume, beetroot for depth, potatoes or celeriac for body. Variety brings balance in both flavour and texture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I stop roasted roots from going soggy?&lt;/strong&gt;Use a hot preheated tray, give everything space, and cut pieces to a similar size. Salt early, then finish with a little acid. Flip once, not five times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can root veg work when I’m short on time?&lt;/strong&gt;Yes. Dice smaller to cook faster, or microwave chunks for 3–4 minutes before roasting. A pressure cooker turns beetroot tender in under 20 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are root vegetables too carby for me?&lt;/strong&gt;They’re carbohydrate-rich, sure, yet their fibre helps slow things down. Pair with protein and healthy fats — yoghurt, beans, eggs, fish — for a meal that feels even steadier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the skins — eat or peel?&lt;/strong&gt;Often, wash and keep them. Skins carry flavour and nutrients. Peel only when the skin is tough or damaged, or when the recipe asks for silky texture (like a velvet mash).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The research found that both random noise and a non-random pure tone had similar effects on a brain activity measure linked to neural noise, which contradicts key assumptions of the prominent moderate brain arousal model. These findings were published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251357074" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Attention Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have observed that listening to random auditory noise, like white or pink noise, can benefit cognitive functioning in individuals with ADHD or elevated traits of the condition. The moderate brain arousal model was proposed to explain this phenomenon. This model is built on two primary assumptions. First, it suggests that ADHD is associated with lower-than-optimal levels of internal neural noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, it proposes that external random noise boosts this internal neural noise through a mechanism called stochastic resonance, improving the brain’s ability to process signals. However, these foundational ideas had not been sufficiently tested, particularly because most studies lacked a direct measure of neural noise or a proper non-random sound condition to isolate the effects of stochastic resonance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joske Rijmen and her colleagues at Ghent University aimed to directly test these two core assumptions of the moderate brain arousal model. They designed an experiment to measure neural noise directly while participants listened to different types of sound. The researchers wanted to see if ADHD traits were indeed linked to lower neural noise at baseline. They also sought to determine if the effects of sound on brain activity were specific to random noise, as the theory of stochastic resonance would predict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct their investigation, the researchers recruited 69 neurotypical adults. Participants first completed the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, a questionnaire used to assess the number and frequency of symptoms associated with the condition. This allowed the scientists to examine ADHD as a spectrum of traits rather than a simple diagnostic category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant then underwent a resting-state electroencephalogram, a non-invasive procedure that records the brain’s electrical activity. While their brain activity was monitored, participants sat with their eyes closed for three distinct two-minute periods: one in silence, one while listening to continuous pink noise (a random signal), and one while listening to a continuous 100 Hz pure tone (a non-random signal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed the electroencephalogram data by focusing on a specific feature known as the aperiodic slope of the power spectral density. This measure reflects background brain activity that is not part of rhythmic brain waves and is considered a direct index of neural noise. A steeper slope in this measurement corresponds to less neural noise, while a flatter slope indicates more neural noise. By examining how this slope changed across the different sound conditions and in relation to participants’ ADHD traits, the scientists could test the predictions of the moderate brain arousal model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings presented a direct challenge to the model’s first assumption. During the silent condition, the researchers found a relationship between ADHD traits and the aperiodic slope. Individuals who reported more traits of ADHD tended to have a flatter slope. This finding suggests that they had more background neural noise, not less. The result is the opposite of what the moderate brain arousal model predicted and aligns with other recent studies that have also found evidence for increased neural noise in older children and adolescents with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also contradicted the model’s second assumption regarding the mechanism of stochastic resonance. When participants with elevated ADHD traits listened to pink noise, their aperiodic slope became steeper. This change signifies a reduction in their neural noise. This outcome is contrary to the model’s suggestion that random noise should increase neural noise in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most significantly, the researchers found that the non-random pure tone had a virtually identical effect on brain activity as the pink noise. Listening to the 100 Hz tone also led to a steeper aperiodic slope, or a decrease in neural noise, in participants with higher levels of ADHD traits. The fact that a non-random sound produced the same effect as a random sound strongly questions the idea that stochastic resonance, which requires a random signal, is the necessary mechanism behind the benefits of auditory stimulation. If stochastic resonance were the driving force, only the pink noise should have produced this effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors propose that an alternative explanation may be needed. Rather than relying on stochastic resonance, both types of sound might have a more general effect on brain arousal. This idea is more consistent with the state regulation deficit account of ADHD, which suggests that individuals with the condition have difficulty regulating their arousal levels to match situational demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to this view, any form of additional stimulation, not just random noise, could help modulate arousal to a more optimal state. The researchers also noted the puzzling observation that stimulation appeared to decrease brain arousal in individuals with higher ADHD traits. They speculate this might relate to difficulties these individuals have in achieving a truly restful state, and the continuous sound may have helped them to calm or regulate their brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has some limitations that the authors acknowledge. The research was conducted with neurotypical adults who varied in their traits of ADHD, so the findings need to be replicated in a group of individuals with a formal clinical diagnosis. Another point is that the brain activity was measured during a resting state, not while participants were engaged in a cognitive task where the benefits of noise are typically observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should explore whether these same brain activity patterns occur during tasks that require attention and focus. Investigating these effects in a clinical sample of people with diagnosed ADHD will be an important next step to confirm these conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251357074" target="_blank"&gt;Pink Noise and a Pure Tone Both Reduce 1/f Neural Noise in Adults With Elevated ADHD Traits: A Critical Appraisal of the Moderate Brain Arousal Model&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Joske Rijmen, Mehdi Senoussi, and Jan R.
