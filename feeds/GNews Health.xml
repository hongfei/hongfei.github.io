  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9uazbjf0012unm4pp2fgf3p@published"&gt;As of this week, there are at least &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/us-measles-total-climbs-800-cases-10-outbreaks"&gt;800 cases&lt;/a&gt; of measles in the U.S. across 25 states. There are 10 outbreaks—defined as three or more related cases—ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/health/measles-outbreak-map.html"&gt;New Mexico to New York&lt;/a&gt;. The largest outbreak, with 597 cases, started in Texas back in January. That’s where we had the first death of an unvaccinated child, in February. Another in April. Three in total. Before this year, there had been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/06/measles-third-death-new-normal/"&gt;three deaths&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the years since the U.S. eliminated the disease (meaning that the disease was no longer continuously spreading) in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb4001j3b75czf1c06t@published"&gt;It’s concerning. The numbers are high, especially considering we’re less than halfway through the year. It’s very possible that &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/third-measles-death"&gt;cases are being underreported&lt;/a&gt;. And they keep rising, with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00786-w"&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that it will slow anytime soon. Which leads us to the million-dollar question: How bad could measles get this year?&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb5001k3b75whtg35o0@published"&gt;While it’s impossible to say for certain, experts say that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/opinion/measles-epidemic-texas.html"&gt;we’re standing on a precipice&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not out of the question that measles could rip through the entire country like wildfire. If each case is a spark, “the brush is burning right now,” says epidemiologist Michael Mina, who studies how infections and vaccines affect human health. Whether the burning brush will ignite the whole forest just depends on how long our strained firewalls can hold.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb5001l3b752lp8jc5q@published"&gt;Measles could continue breaking out in these bubbles (bad, but relatively confined to certain geographic areas). Or, if those bubbles grow large enough, they could converge and turn into a countrywide epidemic (very, very bad). To imagine &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; bad it could get, we can look to Europe, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/opinion/measles-epidemic-texas.html"&gt;Mina recently argued in a New York Times op-ed&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018, the continent saw more than 80,000 cases, tens of thousands of hospitalizations, and over 70 deaths, Mina says, including in countries that had achieved—and subsequently lost—elimination status. That’s possible here, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="176" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb5001m3b75xna6519c@published"&gt;If it feels like this is happening suddenly, it’s not. The U.S. has been moving toward this moment for decades, says Mina, long &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html"&gt;before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. became health secretary&lt;/a&gt;. There are a mix of factors. For one, public health is often a victim of its own success: Once a disease has been wiped out for long enough, people forget how bad it was. In the days before the measles vaccine (aka the MMR vaccine), almost every kid got measles, says &lt;a href="https://shea-online.org/dr-david-weber-named-incoming-president-of-the-society-for-healthcare-epidemiology-of-america/"&gt;David Weber&lt;/a&gt;, president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. Every year 3 million to 4 million people were infected; nearly 50,000 people &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;were hospitalized&lt;/a&gt;; hundreds died. The vaccine changed that. Those who survived the disease decades ago might protest, &lt;em&gt;Hey, I had the measles and just stayed home for a week, no biggie!&lt;/em&gt; People forget how many people died, says Weber. Not to mention, there are new parents today who never had to deal with the measles at all. For many, the idea of their kid getting the measles feels totally theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb5001n3b7545v6mxq4@published"&gt;The consequence of improved public health is that it becomes harder to convince people to go out of their way to vaccinate. Vaccination has always been hard to argue for; sticking a child with a needle full of some substance “goes against a parent’s natural evolutionary instincts,” says Mina. He doesn’t fault parents who worry about vaccination. Instead, he says, it’s the onus of public health officials to make sure parents are “exceedingly comfortable” to push back against those (totally reasonable!) instincts and make an informed decision to protect their child. That requires making sure parents have the information they need to evaluate the risks and benefits of a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb6001o3b75krhct2ix@published"&gt;Vaccine messaging by public health officials has left much to be desired, says Mina. Instead of acknowledging and addressing parents’ worries, they’ve taken a more paternalistic approach—i.e., “Just get the vaccine, it’ll be fine!” Then, early on in the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assured people that you couldn’t get COVID-19 after getting vaccinated, when you &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;in fact still get COVID-19, albeit a much milder version. People felt like they’d been lied to, recalls &lt;a href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/about-us"&gt;Jess Steier&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of the public health data science consulting firm (and &lt;a href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/podcast"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;) Unbiased Science. “They burned the bridge of trust.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb6001p3b75pq7l21nn@published"&gt;Add all that to the fact that the MMR vaccine has been erroneously linked to autism (studies continue to show &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/the-evidence-on-vaccines-and-autism"&gt;no association between vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;). The seed was planted way back in 1998 thanks to a paper in the Lancet—a paper that was later found to be riddled with faulty data and has since been retracted. But that didn’t matter. It had already set off a movement, fanned by RFK Jr. and other &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/opinion/rfk-jr-is-a-vaccine-cynic.html"&gt;vaccine cynics&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, measles vaccination rates had been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html"&gt;dropping for many years&lt;/a&gt; before the pandemic came along.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001q3b75o8hbhq61@published"&gt;And we really need people to get the vaccine. Measles is incredibly contagious, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00786-w"&gt;far more so than COVID or flu&lt;/a&gt;. A single person with measles can walk through, say, a grocery store and continue to infect people for up to two hours after they’ve left the space, says Weber. Roughly &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/resource/frequently-asked-questions-about-measles/"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of unvaccinated people exposed to measles will become infected.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001r3b75xnq2o75a@published"&gt;While measles’ mortality rate is relatively low compared with other diseases—about 0.2 percent of people infected with measles in the U.S. will die—the hospitalization rate is incredibly high: 20 percent, for people who haven’t been vaccinated. “This is not a benign disease,” says Weber. “How many infectious diseases do we have that 10 to 20 percent of the people end up in the hospital?” (It’s certainly not that high for flu, COVID, or other respiratory illnesses.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="158" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001s3b75jp4hxip7@published"&gt;All that being said, here’s the very &lt;em&gt;worst-&lt;/em&gt;case scenario for what could happen next with measles, according to Steier’s calculations. Given measles’ mortality rate of 0.2 percent, if the &lt;em&gt;entire &lt;/em&gt;unvaccinated U.S. population (23.5 million people) were exposed to measles, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIEM3qQuFTC/?img_index=3"&gt;nearly 50,000&lt;/a&gt; people could die. (This would likely occur over several years.) Given that 90 percent of exposed unvaccinated people become infected, and then 20 percent of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; number face hospitalization, millions could end up in the hospital, and some with &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/symptoms-causes/syc-20374857"&gt;potentially lifelong complications&lt;/a&gt;, including neurological damage, intellectual disabilities, and hearing loss. They also face the risk of something called &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/inside-immune-amnesia"&gt;immune amnesia&lt;/a&gt;, where the immune system “forgets” its immunity to other infectious diseases for a period of weeks to years. Even if they survive the measles, they could suffer or die from something else &lt;em&gt;because &lt;/em&gt;they got the measles. None of these calculations include the 22 million immunocompromised Americans who face heightened risk even if they were vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001t3b75nyt9nq44@published"&gt;It’s unclear what a nationwide outbreak would mean for the vaccinated population, says Steier. The MMR vaccine is &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/03/measles-outbreak-vaccine-booster-titers.html"&gt;incredibly effective&lt;/a&gt;—roughly 97 percent of people are protected with two shots—but it’s not been tested in an environment where there are thousands of cases. “We could see more breakthrough cases of measles, potentially,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001u3b75iv1ypjlv@published"&gt;It might also change how we live our lives. Like COVID days, we could see travel advisories or requirements to carry proof of immunity (which could cause procedural challenges, considering how many people are immune due to prior infection and thus have no vaccination records to prove their immunity, says Weber). This, of course, will depend on how the federal government responds.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="135" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001v3b75hz2r3mw5@published"&gt;Again, those are worst-case scenarios. How exactly measles will play out isn’t certain. But the way forward is clear, experts say: The only thing that can end the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine, full stop. That’s our firewall. In the current outbreaks, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;96 percent of people&lt;/a&gt; who have been infected are unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. In the case of a measles infection, which can take days to develop symptoms, even a vaccination right before an individual gets exposed and infected can still make a difference in protecting them. That means “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/essential-programme-on-immunization/implementation/catch-up-vaccination"&gt;catch-up&lt;/a&gt;” vaccination campaigns can be “very, very powerful” if an unvaccinated community gets hit hard with measles, says Mina. In other words, there are things that can be done late in the game, even if we cross into wildfire territory.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001w3b75cnk8nlfq@published"&gt;Alas, we continue to see mixed messaging about vaccines by the Department of Health and Human Services. In the past, kids dying of measles might have led to swift action by the CDC, such as widespread catch-up vaccination campaigns (some CDC employees &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-measles-cases-missed-texas-us-rfkjr-rcna201426"&gt;have been deployed&lt;/a&gt; to Texas, though resources are low after federal funding cuts last month). But even after the first child’s death in February, RFK Jr. continued to question the MMR vaccine and tout therapies, like vitamin A, that &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/03/measles-rfk-jr-vitamin-a-research-vaccination-nutrition-debunk.html"&gt;are not preventive measures&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn’t until early April that he &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354900/hhs-rfk-endorses-mmr-measles-vaccine-stoking-supporters-fury"&gt;finally endorsed the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. And yet “the only way that we can prevent measles is MMR,” says Steier. “It’s bananas that we’re talking about anything else.”&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001x3b753sezczft@published"&gt;The good news is that, regardless of lagging federal efforts, individuals can opt to protect themselves &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/03/measles-outbreak-vaccine-booster-titers.html"&gt;with a vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that is incredibly effective. If you’re in an outbreak area or planning to travel, make sure you and your children are vaccinated, says Weber. Infants can receive an early vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/measles-vaccine-can-young-children-get-early-dose-mmr-shot-rcna198038"&gt;at 6 months&lt;/a&gt; (this would not be considered to be one of the standard doses, so they’d later still need the full two-shot regimen). As the threat has grown more imminent, “we are seeing an increased awareness amongst millions of people,” notes Mina. Hopefully many of them will update their risk-benefit analysis and get vaccinated, he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="121" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001y3b7581wzrae7@published"&gt;In the meantime, experts are keeping an eye out for red flags that we’re going the wrong way. If outbreak bubbles continue to grow—or worse, converge—we move closer toward a national epidemic, Mina says. Steier worries about a study that RFK Jr. has ordered to investigate the link between autism and vaccines, which will be headed by &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/dc-warns-major-measles-exposure-hhs-names-geier-study-autism-and-vaccines"&gt;David Geier&lt;/a&gt;, a man who &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/"&gt;has been disciplined for practicing medicine without a license&lt;/a&gt;, has no advanced science degree, and has suggested for decades that vaccines cause autism. If the study claims to find a link (again, the existence of such a link has already been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/03/vaccine-autism-rfk-jr-how-science-proves-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/"&gt;investigated thoroughly and disproven&lt;/a&gt;), Steier anticipates that vaccination rates could plunge—the opposite of what needs to be happening.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001z3b75p1dbjwoo@published"&gt;Until vaccination rates improve, we’ll teeter on the edge with this disease. It’s not clear what will happen with measles next—but we’re not in a good &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;spot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The analysis, based on nearly two million people, showed that the more components of metabolic syndrome a person had, the greater their dementia risk, with women and those in their 40s being most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study does not prove causation, it highlights the importance of managing cardiovascular and metabolic health during midlife. Preventive lifestyle changes could play a key role in reducing early cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s and Vascular Dementia:&lt;/strong&gt; Metabolic syndrome was linked to both major dementia subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;70% Risk Increase:&lt;/strong&gt; People with all five components of metabolic syndrome had a 70% higher risk of young-onset dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex and Age Disparity:&lt;/strong&gt; Women and individuals in their 40s faced the highest increased risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a larger waistline, high blood pressure and other risk factors that make up metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased risk of young-onset dementia, according to a study published on April 23, 2025, online in &lt;em&gt;Neurology.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young-onset dementia is diagnosed before the age of 65. The study does not prove that metabolic syndrome causes young-onset dementia, it only shows an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic syndrome is defined as having excess belly fat plus two or more of the following risk factors: high blood pressure, high blood sugar, higher than normal triglycerides, which are a type of fat found in the blood, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or “good” cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most dementia is diagnosed in older age, young-onset dementia occurs while a person is still working and perhaps raising a family,” said study author Minwoo Lee, MD, PhD, of Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital in Anyang, South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our study found having metabolic syndrome in middle age is a risk factor for young-onset dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers reviewed national health insurance data in South Korea to identify nearly two million people between the ages of 40 and 60 who had a health check-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The check-up included measurements of waist circumference, blood pressure, blood sugar, triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Of all participants, 25% had metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over an average follow-up period of eight years, 8,921 people, or 0.45% of all participants, developed dementia. For those with metabolic syndrome, the incidence rate was 0.86 cases per 1,000 person-years, compared to 0.49 cases for those without metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person-years represent both the number of people in the study and the amount of time each person spends in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, education and health factors such as level of physical activity, depression and stroke, researchers found metabolic syndrome was associated with a 24% higher risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking at specific types of dementia, it was associated with a 12% increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease and a 21% increased risk of vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found female participants with metabolic syndrome had a 34% increased risk of dementia compared to male participants who had a 15% increased risk. People in their 40s had a greater risk than people in their 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found each component of metabolic syndrome was associated with an increased risk of dementia, which was cumulative. People with all five components had a 70% increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome, such as eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking and reducing stress, may help reduce the risk of young-onset dementia,” said Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Future research that follows people over longer periods of time and uses brain scans to look for biomarkers of dementia is needed to confirm and expand upon our findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that researchers did not review genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the Korean National Research Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this metabolism and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8b6bbb7b6aab9bc98b9b9b6f6bbb7b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natalie Conrad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Natalie Conrad – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 13:56:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5YNk4wS3poV0c4d0tTQl9UZXZRQ1A2Y2k5cXViVjJhaHlNRHJfakFVZUh6X0FNLXRVMlNXOXFoWDBGTUEwUTlCbG11enBJOGx0RkZocUFtR1NUdXBCVXhpNUMtWFlPUVdLRjNaLVJLZUI</guid></item><item><title>密歇根州确认第9例麻疹病例，警告可能的接触部位- MLive.com | Michigan confirms 9th measles case, warns of possible exposure site - MLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DVZT743OGNFOXBXJE5HX64Q3QM"&gt;Ingham County has its second confirmed measles infection of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HIHEJVD5ZBHF5KHJFFHEXGH3FY"&gt;A 1-year-old boy tested positive for the highly infectious disease Tuesday, April 22, after being exposed to the county’s first confirmed case earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="425SRSHKNJAQHC55TYGUMLQXWI"&gt;The boy experienced only mild symptoms, Ingham County health officials reported late Wednesday, April 23. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6N6MOZBHD5BBNI6QE2WHKEL65Y"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RELATED: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/04/measles-trending-toward-worst-year-in-decades-warns-michigans-top-doc.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/04/measles-trending-toward-worst-year-in-decades-warns-michigans-top-doc.html"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measles trending toward worst year in decades, warns Michigan’s top doc&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3TEBTIKQOVF5RJ7EIW5VSUDDAI"&gt;He was “age-appropriately vaccinated,” which likely means he got his first dose, recommended at 12 to 15 months, but not a second and final dose, recommended at 4 to 6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GUVENI3FE5BYTAPSBL6DUBCB7U"&gt;The local health department said early isolation and limited exposure means the risk of infection for the public remains low.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes amid a major outbreak in West &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-bae8b720-10af-11f0-986b-856b684cc348" class=""&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, that has already sickened around 500 people and led to two deaths, marking the first fatalities in a decade in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, cases crossed a grim milestone last month surpassing the tally for the whole of 2024 and reaching their highest level since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials suspect the latest patient was exposed to measles while traveling abroad. They had not yet been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials are warning anyone who may have been exposed to the virus to monitor themselves for symptoms for the next two weeks, particularly if they are unvaccinated, and contact their health provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anyone who develops symptoms is encouraged to immediately contact health services for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seattle–Tacoma International Airport is the primary international airport serving Seattle and its surrounding metropolitan area.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2024, it served 52.6 million passengers, ranking 11th in the US by passenger numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials say no infections linked to the infected individual have been reported to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the matter, Seattle-based public health worker Elysia Gonzales said: 'Measles is highly contagious and if you don't have immunity, you can get it just by being in an area where a person with measles has been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We've seen an increase in measles cases around the world and in the US, so it's an important time to check your vaccination status and get vaccinated if you aren't protected.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is one of the most infectious diseases in the world, with one person capable of spreading the virus to nine out of every 10 people they meet if those individuals are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is transmitted via breathing in infectious droplets that can remain suspended in the air for two hours after an infected patient passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients develop a fever, cough, and runny nose, which then develops into a rash that starts at the hairline before spreading to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There's no cure for measles, with doctors instead using antibiotics to treat related infections and IV fluids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If unvaccinated, about one in five people who are infected are hospitalized while one in 20 children develop pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among unvaccinated children infected with measles, about one in 1,000 will develop encephalitis — or swelling of the brain. And nearly one to three out of every 1,000 will die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccine is 97 percent effective at preventing an infection and is required for children attending school in some states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of when to get vaccinated, Gonzales says: 'Children need two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The vaccine showed effectiveness in mice and non-human primates, prompting researchers to pursue human clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It targets a specific region of the tau protein, pT181, linked to Alzheimer’s-related brain damage and cognitive decline. If successful in humans, this approach could complement or even surpass current therapies that only modestly impact disease progression by targeting amyloid beta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tau-Targeting Vaccine:&lt;/strong&gt; Generates antibodies against pT181, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s pathology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Immune Response:&lt;/strong&gt; Proven effective in mice and macaques, with long-lasting immunity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Trials Ahead:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers are preparing for Phase 1 human trials pending funding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of New Mexico&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers hope to launch human clinical trials in their quest for a vaccine to prevent the buildup of pathological tau – a protein in the brain associated with Alzheimer’s dementia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new paper published in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/em&gt;, a team led by Kiran Bhaskar, PhD, professor in the Department of Molecular Genetics &amp;amp; Microbiology in the UNM School of Medicine, found that the experimental vaccine generated a robust immune response in both mice and non-human primates, building on earlier research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109070"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The vaccine elicited a strong immune response in two other strains of mice bred to develop tau-related disease – one of which had a human tau gene inserted in its genome. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because we’ve shown efficacy in the non-human primate, I think that is suggesting to us it’s much closer to a clinical trial,” Bhaskar said, adding that he and his colleagues are seeking funding from venture capitalists and the Alzheimer’s Association to launch a Phase 1 trial in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tau is a naturally occurring protein that helps stabilize neurons, but when it undergoes a process called phosphorylation, it deforms and is ejected from neurons into the extracellular space, creating the tangles that are characteristic of Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several new FDA-approved treatments for drugs that reduce levels of amyloid beta, another protein implicated in Alzheimer’s pathology, but they have only a modest effect on the progression of the disease, leading many to wonder whether targeting tau might be a better bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The active immunotherapy developed at UNM generates antibodies that bind to pT181, a region of the altered tau protein that has been identified as an Alzheimer’s biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2019 paper published in &lt;em&gt;NPJ Vaccines&lt;/em&gt;, Bhaskar and his colleagues reported that when the vaccine was given to mice bred to express pathological tau they generated antibodies, reduced the extent of the tangles in key brain structures and improved their performance on tests to gauge their cognitive disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new paper expands on those findings. The vaccine elicited a strong immune response in two other strains of mice bred to develop tau-related disease – one of which had a human tau gene inserted in its genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a collaboration with the University of California, Davis, and the California National Primate Research Center  the vaccine was also administered to macaques, primates whose immune systems and brains are closer to humans. They also showed a strong and durable immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tested antibodies in the serum from the immunized monkeys on samples of blood plasma drawn from people with mild cognitive impairment, often a precursor to full-blown Alzheimer’s dementia, as well as the sera in brain tissue from people who had died from Alzheimer’s, and found that they bound to the human version of the tau protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine was developed using a virus-like particle (VLP) platform developed by Bryce Chackerian and David Peabody, Bhaskar’s colleagues in Molecular Genetics &amp;amp; Microbiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VLPs are essentially viruses whose DNA has been removed, rendering them harmless. Snippets of proteins – in this case pT181 – can be attached to their surface, rendering them visible to immune cells on the lookout for invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VLP-based vaccines have been shown to create durable immunity, with one primary inoculation and two booster shots, Bhaskar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They don’t require adjuvants – substances (such as aluminum) administered with a vaccine to enhance the immune response. And, they have been shown to be safe in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicole Maphis, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the UNM Department of Neurosciences, was the first author on both of the vaccine papers. She said the collaboration with UC Davis was critical for validating the vaccine’s efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was important because it extends our work in an animal model that is more similar to humans,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mice don’t have a human immune response, but these non-human primates, their immune response is much more similar to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#85e6ebe2e4f7e6ece4c5f6e4e9f0e1abf0ebe8abe0e1f0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chris Ramirez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unm.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Chris Ramirez – University of New Mexico&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/alz.70101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Targeting of phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 by a Qβ virus-like particle vaccine is safe, highly immunogenic, and reduces disease severity in mice and rhesus macaques&lt;/a&gt;” by Kiran Bhaskar et al. &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting of phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 by a Qβ virus-like particle vaccine is safe, highly immunogenic, and reduces disease severity in mice and rhesus macaques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70101-sec-0010-title"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathological accumulation of tau (pTau) contributes to various tauopathies, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and correlates with cognitive decline. A rapid surge in tau-targeted approaches via anti-sense oligonucleotides, active/passive immunotherapies suggests that targeting p-Tau is a viable strategy against tauopathies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70101-sec-0020-title"&gt;METHOD&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We describe a multi-species validation of our previously described Qß virus-like particle (VLP)–based vaccine technology targeting phosphorylated tau on threonine 181 (pT181-Qß).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70101-sec-0030-title"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two vaccine doses of pT181-Qß, without any adjuvants, elicited robust antibody responses in two different mouse models of tauopathy (PS19 and hTau) and rhesus macaques. In mouse models, vaccination reduced AT180+ hyperphosphorylated, Sarkosyl insoluble, Gallyas silver positive tau, inflammasomes/neuroinflammation, and improved recognition memory and motor function without inducing adverse T-cell activation. Anti-pT181 antibodies are reactive to pTau in human AD brains, engage pT181+ tau in human brain lysates, and are central nervous system bioavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70101-sec-0040-title"&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest the translational utility of pT181-Qß against tauopathies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The company behind the product, Contraline, says the approach offers a reversible alternative to condoms and vasectomies, with the hydrogel designed to break down in the body after a set period of time, restoring fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Contraline has released details of its phase 1 clinical trial, revealing Adam can successfully block the release of sperm for 24 months, with no sperm detected in the semen of the two participants who have so far reached this time point in the trial. In addition, it said no serious adverse events had been recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is really exciting because our goal since day one has been to create a two-year-long male contraceptive – that is what the demand is for: a two-year-long, temporary or reversible male birth control. And we have the first data to show that that’s possible,” said Kevin Eisenfrats, the founder and chief executive of Contraline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eisenfrats said the 25 participants in the clinical trial were enrolled at different points in time, with more results expected to follow. “It’s great proof of concept,” he added..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eisenfrats said the implant was inserted in a minimally invasive procedure that took about 10 minutes and used local anaesthetic, meaning the patient remained awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Adam is not the first male contraceptive in development that acts by blocking the sperm ducts (vas deferens), although Eisenfrats said some other implants had used materials that did not break down in the body. He said there was little data to show fertility was restored after these were removed, while there were also concerns such implants could cause scarring of the vas deferens and lead to permanent sterilisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The results from the Adam clinical trial have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal and do not include data on the reversibility of the implant. However, Eisenfrats said the hydrogel had a predictable lifespan and had been shown to break down over time in animal trials, with work using lower doses in men revealing a shorter period of efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The way to think about this is sort of like the IUD [intrauterine device] for men,” Eisenfrats said, adding that after a two-year period men could decide whether to get another implant. The team is working on a procedure to enable “on-demand reversal”.

Researchers found that boys born to mothers who experienced early-life adversity gained significantly more weight per day than average, despite being full-term, healthy, and mostly breastfed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest early metabolic alterations linked to intergenerational trauma, with the male placenta being more vulnerable to maternal stress-related factors like inflammation and cortisol. While the changes raise concerns about long-term health risks, researchers emphasize that these effects are modifiable with early monitoring and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-Specific Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Only male infants showed excessive early weight gain linked to maternal trauma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolic Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Boys gained up to 78g/day—well above the WHO’s recommended 30g/day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Placental Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Male placentas are more sensitive to inflammatory signals from maternal stress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;FAPESP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adverse situations experienced by the mother during childhood – such as neglect or physical, psychological or sexual violence – can trigger excessive weight gain in male children as early as the first two months of life. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was shown in a study that followed 352 pairs of newborns and their mothers in the cities of Guarulhos and São Paulo, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109066"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a mom and baby." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Another important issue is that the placenta of male fetuses tends to be more susceptible to fluctuations in substances and metabolites present in the maternal bloodstream compared to female placentas. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyses indicated the occurrence of very early metabolic alterations in babies that not only led to weight gain above that expected for their age but also have the potential to increase the future risk of developing obesity and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first article resulting from a Thematic Project supported by FAPESP and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States. Using a database of 580 vulnerable pregnant women, the group is studying intergenerational trauma, i.e., negative effects that can be passed on to future generations, even if the offspring have not lived through such experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted by researchers from Columbia and Duke Universities, both in the United States, and the School of Medicine of the Federal University of São Paulo (EPM-UNIFESP) in Brazil, the study focuses on issues related to mother-baby interaction, development, and mental and physical health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We observed that although the babies were born weighing within the expected parameters, in the first few days of life they showed altered weight gain, far above what’s recommended as ideal by the World Health Organization [&lt;em&gt;WHO&lt;/em&gt;],” says Andrea Parolin Jackowski, professor at UNIFESP and coordinator of the project in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the WHO, the ideal weight gain in the first stage of life is up to 30 grams per day. However, the male babies in the study had an average weight gain of 35 grams per day – with some gaining up to 78 grams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The babies who took part in the study were born full-term, healthy and within the ideal weight range. All of the pregnancies we followed were low-risk, but our data showed that every adversity the mother experienced during childhood increased the babies’ weight gain by 1.8 grams per day. And this was limited to males,” the researcher reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Jackowski, there are many factors that can influence a baby’s weight in early life, and maternal childhood trauma appears to be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, the analysis took care to control for so-called confounders – variables related to the mothers’ stress levels that could influence the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some examples include lifetime trauma experiences (the effects of which are cumulative) and current trauma, as well as education level and socioeconomic status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also important to note that 70% of the babies who took part in the study were exclusively breastfed. The other 30% were on mixed feeding [&lt;em&gt;a combination of breast milk and formula&lt;/em&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means that they weren’t eating filled cookies or other foods that could actually change their weight. Therefore, the results suggest the occurrence of an early metabolic alteration in these babies,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why only boys?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researcher, maternal trauma during childhood only had an impact on the weight of male babies because of physiological variations in the placenta associated with the sex of the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The placenta is a temporary organ composed of maternal and fetal tissue that shows structural differences and differences in the regulation and expression of steroids and proteins depending on the sex of the baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Male fetuses develop strategies to maintain constant growth in the face of an adverse intrauterine environment, leading to a greater risk of prematurity and fetal death,” explains the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, she adds, childhood adversity is known to increase the risk of depression and anxiety during pregnancy, which can lead to increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cortisol in the intrauterine environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “It appears that the placenta of female fetuses adapts to protect them, slowing down the growth rate without restricting intrauterine growth [&lt;em&gt;i.e., the size of the baby is within the expected range at the end of pregnancy&lt;/em&gt;] and allowing for a higher survival rate,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important issue is that the placenta of male fetuses tends to be more susceptible to fluctuations in substances and metabolites present in the maternal bloodstream compared to female placentas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a result, in these cases of trauma, it can become more permeable, causing the male fetus to be more exposed to inflammatory factors resulting from high levels of stress, such as cortisol and interleukins, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work now published is the first to identify intergenerational trauma as a trigger for physical changes at such an early age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s already known that adverse events in the mother’s childhood can trigger psychological and developmental problems, but our study is pioneering in showing that they can affect physical problems, such as weight gain, as early as the first two months of life,” says Jackowski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the research team, which includes Vinicius O. Santana and FAPESP postdoctoral fellow Aline C. Ramos, will follow the weight development of the children of mothers who suffered adversity in childhood until they are 24 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to follow them for longer because we want to investigate the impact of the introduction of food, which usually occurs at 6 months of age,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the researchers explain, the research suggests that metabolic changes can be modified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a matter of determinism. We need to monitor how the metabolism and inflammatory factors behave in these babies over a longer period of time to understand how to modulate this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to know that all of this is modifiable, and we’re now going to look at how we can intervene,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#056d77606c6b607771456364756076752b6777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Heloisa Reinert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://fapesp.br" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FAPESP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Heloisa Reinert – FAPESP&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-87078-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sex-specific association between maternal childhood adversities and offspring’s weight gain in a Brazilian cohort&lt;/a&gt;” by Andrea Parolin Jackowski et al. &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-specific association between maternal childhood adversities and offspring’s weight gain in a Brazilian cohort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are linked to negative health and developmental outcomes in offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, whether maternal ACEs influence infant weight gain in the first months of life, and if this effect differs by infant sex, remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study included 352 full-term newborns from low-risk pregnancies and their mothers in low-income settings in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropometric data (weight, length, head circumference) and other information (feeding type, offspring sex, family income) were collected at delivery (W0), discharge (W1), and up to 8 weeks postpartum (W2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACEs were assessed using the CDC-Kaiser Questionnaire, and weight gain was calculated as the difference between W2 and W1, divided by the number of days between measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association between maternal ACEs and offspring weight gain was positive only in male offspring (unstandardized coefficient (male) = 1.82, SE = 0.438, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001); for each 1-point increase in the ACEs score (e.g., from 0 to 1), weight gain increased by 1.8 g/day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that maternal ACEs are associated with increased weight gain in male infants during the first two months of life, potentially increasing the risk of future obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is required to investigate the underlying biological mechanisms and their neurodevelopmental implications.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 12:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE52OHJJdnNhanpubnRYeTI3M3FmaXhQdFZ6RHRTSGlsUUx5aENzTE9peHVJX2JENnVLVVNzVW40N29uUWtQVTNrQU1SaC1fSWRCLWktLVh5Zl9rRE4xQ2tJb1VkTUFtVmZ4SzBQMFZldG1ZQQ</guid></item><item><title>免疫恢复力被确定为健康衰老和长寿的关键-神经科学新闻 | Immune Resilience Identified as Key to Healthy Aging and Longevity - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE5Udkloamc1U0dxQk1zd1pXRHdYX2JYelY1ODlDMlFEWHYzd1RXSFZHdzkzdUcweFBqRFR5bFowQ0xON0hHa185OVk0Q1NvSWxaeEdySWs1RkhCMGNjSC1EOUZXbFhVamJwY1d3Z3lwVDJpRUVRMHRjaQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that immune resilience, a person’s ability to maintain a robust, youthful immune system, plays a critical role in promoting long-term health and extending life. By analyzing data from over 17,000 individuals, researchers found that immune resilience, particularly involving the TCF7 gene, protects against chronic inflammation, immunosenescence, and cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals in midlife with high immune resilience had a 69% lower mortality rate and a biological age advantage of up to 15 years.

After age 70, mortality rates converge between resilient and non-resilient groups, reflecting biological limits on longevity extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TNFα-blockers restore salutogenesis pathways, indicating IR delays aging-related processes rather than altering aging rates. By reframing aging as a salutogenic-pathogenic balance, we establish &lt;em&gt;TCF7&lt;/em&gt;-centered IR as central to healthy longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeted midlife interventions to enhance IR offer actionable strategies to maximize healthspan before biological constraints limit benefits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 12:13:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE5Udkloamc1U0dxQk1zd1pXRHdYX2JYelY1ODlDMlFEWHYzd1RXSFZHdzkzdUcweFBqRFR5bFowQ0xON0hHa185OVk0Q1NvSWxaeEdySWs1RkhCMGNjSC1EOUZXbFhVamJwY1d3Z3lwVDJpRUVRMHRjaQ</guid></item><item><title>医生就时尚饮食向女性发出紧急警告，这可能会破坏成为母亲的机会-每日邮报 | Doctor's urgent warning to women over trendy diet that could wreck chances of motherhood - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A top medic has urged women to consider risks to their hormonal health of one of the UK's most popular dieting trends, as it could leave them unable to conceive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an Instagram post that has been watched 1.5million times, Dr Karan &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-988202b0-20fc-11f0-830d-9742bde33fe5"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; colorectal surgeon Dr Karan Rajan has warned of the dangers of the carnivore diet - which involves eating lots of meat and little carbohydrates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While harms such as bowel problems and high cholesterol have previously been highlighted, Dr Rajan has flagged a little-known risk to the female sex hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you're a woman thinking about going carnivore, there is one crucial thing you need to know first,' he told his 2 million followers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A lack of fibre - a key element of the diet - can lead to 'hormonal imbalances that wreak havoc on everything from your cycle, to your skin, to even your metabolism,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'For most people, fibre isn't a suggestion, it's a biological necessity for hormonal balance, gut health and acting as the oil that greases the creaky human body.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;This is especially true for women, the leading surgeon explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excess oestrogen in the body binds to fibre, which help it to be removed from the body, preventing upset to the delicate balance of sex hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But without adequate fibre, '&lt;span&gt;oestrogen can be reabsorbed by your intestines which can lead to hormonal imbalances', Dr Rajan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to irregular periods and difficulty getting pregnant, hormonal acne, and even weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Georgia Heins, who has 1.5million followers on Instagram, shared her experience of the diet, which 'destroyed' her hormones' and left her with the debilitating symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said in a social media clip: 'All I wanted was abs, so I followed a carnivore diet for eight weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I lost fat, saw abs like never before but also lost my period, developed PCOS and felt more lifeless than my house plants and they’ve been dead for months. Then came the acne.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common condition that affects a woman's ability to regularly release an egg for fertilisation. This can result in difficulty getting pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@georgiaheins/video/7477251974262557974" data-video-id="7477251974262557974" data-embed-from="oembed"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a title="@georgiaheins" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@georgiaheins?refer=embed"&gt;@georgiaheins&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;PCOS isn’t a TikTok trend. It’s losing your period, wrecking your skin, and fighting your body every day. I know - because I didn’t have any symptoms… until I went carnivore. Now, I’m not saying carnivore is bad, I’m not against it at all. Some people thrive on it and have only seen positive effects. But for me? It destroyed my hormones. I lost my period. Developed PCOS. Broke out worse than ever. And my energy? Non-existent. Truth is, women’s hormones are EVERYTHING. And extreme diets can mess with them more than you think. And the worst part? PCOS doesn’t have a cure. You don’t fix it with a detox tea, cutting carbs, or some influencer’s magic supplement. You manage it - with the right food, training, and lifestyle that actually supports your hormones. PCOS isn’t a trend. It’s not an excuse. It’s not something you self-diagnose on TikTok. It’s real. 💙&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a title="♬ original sound - Georgia Heins" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7477251991270361878?refer=embed"&gt;♬ original sound - Georgia Heins&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Georgia Heins said she didn't have any symptoms of PCOS until she went on the carnivore diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rajan explained that these symptoms can be caused by a lack of fibre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some people might even feel fine on a carnivore diet, but I'd argue they are in the minority', he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent data shows that some 200,000 people in the UK look for information about the carnivore diet online every month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many, including celebrities like Joe Rogan, have championed the eating plan for its fat-burning abilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The high-protein, low-carb diet works by putting the body into a state of ketosis - forcing it to burn fat, rather than carbohydrate, for energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this too can have devastating consequences for a woman's reproductive system, experts have warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lisa Goldstein, a leading nutritionist who specialises in reproductive health, said: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you don't eat enough - especially too few carbs - your brain can switch off ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medically known as hypothalamic amenorrhea, this is the body's way of avoiding pregnancy when energy reserves are low, she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can be caused by being on a calorie-restrictive diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Unlike men, women's reproductive systems require a minimum threshold of calories, carbs and body fat to function', she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Carnivore diets have also been linked to increased risk of bowel cancer, heart disease, stroke and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 11:33:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxNTzJDUGctZjNJOUUyQU1jMTVGeFhidDZsUXBLalBDYkd4REhNbXpTX21jUlFMdVJKbk80djZPSDlRMkVMUzFhMVNWQ3lWWV9RMlVoWVp3S09oU0U3SF9NLU45Qkk3Q2VZYWh3TGl5ZW11S01NZWQwM2V3S3k3Z0VlMURnUjVnVDh2STI0RlJiTUZxZzBfSWFvWWZ6WXE4R01JcHZYRXR1Tjg2MnVhNjJ2RWMzQUJsb2xRYjhGSkxCeVlKQdIBxwFBVV95cUxPV2xLSU9HU1dGNjYwY0YwYkUwSmRORFNFRkMtakVJY2szTDBIM0NUUjFKVXA3Unl3QzJScExCYUJvN1VtajVZSkVDNndjRzVkekU3SEZwSmVMVTNUX2pFcW1mVzNWenRXSmp2dVRLMGdaTzRwaDFSMklOcGt0QTJBOXZmVFlvbUtzZ25QSGhxaHVLTDRKd1ZhdEktTUo3Vk92TzVKVWM0RGZRU3k0S2U1b2tvb0RCRnlrVERJS01VX3Z6WnF0T1FF</guid></item><item><title>我放弃了Ozempic ，接受了健康而不是追求瘦身的感觉- NPR | I quit Ozempic and embraced feeling healthy over striving for thinness - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQX1cydFdxcjcwM1p4MnoyTTFWUERRdTJUTTMwc0hVaHAwbDFFUVJSazFROXF5YWI5VEpQS0V1N0VOVTc4WGhaRUFxWTFmdW1UMDc4U3FWUnJVb0xMR2xFYUxlUWhUbFRKRkF0WnZrMUl2TEt5em82NkZYTFNWX183RHEyQ1A0emhWNjNhWA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;
      
   &lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2022, I decided to try taking Ozempic to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the time, I was an early adopter. The media frenzy about GLP1 agonists hadn't yet started. Even my own doctor was surprised at my request.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I haven't really prescribed them for weight loss much," she told me. "Have you tried Noom? Or meals from HelloFresh?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But I'm a primary care doctor, and I'd been following the scientific literature that showed GLP1 agonists could now be used specifically for weight loss. I wanted to try them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the end, I was also an early quitter: I stopped taking the drug within months of starting it. Ozempic made me nauseated, gave me heartburn, disrupted my sleep. It wasn't worth it.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;I was not alone, it turns out, in finding it difficult to stick with the Ozempic. New research shows the vast majority of people who try GLP-1 agonists for weight loss end up stopping them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while many people benefit from these medications, I think doctors can learn from the fact that so many people give up on them, too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When I started thinking about giving Ozempic a try, I had given birth the year before. Like most women, I had gained weight in pregnancy. Also like most women, I thought I had to lose it all to "get healthy" again.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;My doctor's initial advice wasn't terrible – eating vegetables and regular exercise are indeed good for you — but I had heard it before. I had doled out the same recommendations to my own patients a million times, without much success.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the end, my doctor prescribed the Ozempic. When I gave myself my first injection, I was optimistic it would help me feel healthier.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Since then, I've started writing publicly about &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/04/1202723479/ozempic-body-positive-medicine-weight-stigma" target="_blank"&gt;being a size-inclusive physician&lt;/a&gt; who doesn't push my patients to lose weight. But at the time, I hadn't yet fully embraced a weight-neutral approach to caring for my patients — and caring for myself. After all, I had spent years of medical training absorbing the message that the only way to be healthy was to get down to a body mass index of 25 or below.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But my experience with Ozempic made me realize I had confused two distinct issues: Being healthy is not always the same thing as being thin.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When I tried Ozempic, I had been struggling to get back into exercise after childbirth. With a baby at home disrupting my sleep, I felt sluggish all the time. I thought the medication might help me get more energized.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Instead, I started feeling almost immediately terrible. The heartburn was the first side effect I noticed, then the nausea. At a friend's wedding that summer, I toasted the couple with a glass of champagne, then spent the entire reception vomiting in a bathroom stall. I felt too sick to exercise. It was hard to sleep because of the abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I felt, in a word, unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I wasn't exactly systematic when I stopped taking it. I definitely didn't talk to my doctor about it. (Classic doctor behavior – we're the worst patients.) I just made excuses about skipping a week, and then another.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And I'm not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;My experience was not unique, new research shows. The majority of people who start GLP1 agonists end up stopping them, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829779" target="_blank"&gt;according to research published earlier this year in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The study authors found that nearly 65% of study subjects who were taking the medications explicitly for weight loss, rather than diabetes control, ended up going off them within a year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It wasn't clear why individual patients stopped the drugs, but researchers found some common reasons. Patients who experienced significant side effects were more likely to quit the medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Patients with lower income levels were also more likely to quit, presumably because they couldn't afford them. (&lt;a href="https://whyy.org/articles/independence-blue-cross-restrict-coverage-ozempic-weight-loss/" target="_blank"&gt;A growing number of insurers&lt;/a&gt; are no longer covering the medications, because they're so expensive, which shifts the costs directly on to patients.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People who lost a significant amount of weight were another group who quit at a higher rate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Or maybe, like me, some of those quitters felt healthier when they weren't taking the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When I stopped the Ozempic, I slowly found myself feeling better. I started exercising again, taking my son in the jogging stroller and hiking with my family on the weekends. My sleep was less disrupted by an upset stomach. I allowed myself to enjoy food.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I didn't lose weight, but my blood pressure and glucose levels remained normal. I felt more vibrant and alive. My mental health was better. Was it possible that I could be healthy &lt;em&gt;without &lt;/em&gt;a BMI of 25?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lots of my fellow doctors don't think so. "Greater efforts are needed to increase access and adherence," the &lt;em&gt;JAMA &lt;/em&gt;researchers wrote in their article about GLP-1 discontinuation rates, the assumption being that the goal of doctors everywhere should be to get patients to take the medications — and stick to them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I'm not anti-Ozempic; far from it. I prescribe GLP-1s for many of my patients, and lots of them show improvement on metrics like blood glucose, hypertension, and kidney function. Many of my patients say the drugs help them lead much healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But a narrow focus on weight — which, so often, our medical training still teaches — misses the point that there's more to being well than a number on the scale. For me, I felt healthier at a higher weight because &lt;em&gt;stopping &lt;/em&gt;Ozempic helped me exercise regularly, sleep better, and feel less pain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some of my patients tell me similar stories. One woman told me that having a peaceful relationship with food is more important to her than a few pounds of weight loss. Another patient told me that "being skinny isn't worth feeling sick every day."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I worry that in the age of Ozempic, we doctors have returned to a myopic obsession with weight as the definition of health. Instead of focusing on objective measures like kidney function or liver inflammation, doctors instead hone in on BMI, a metric that the American Medical Association has denounced as &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/ama-use-bmi-alone-imperfect-clinical-measure" target="_blank"&gt;not rigorous enough &lt;/a&gt;to evaluate an individual patient's health. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Just look at the hand-wringing &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819256" target="_blank"&gt;in another recent paper&lt;/a&gt; that showed high rates of people quitting GLP1s: "Discontinuation could have policy and medication coverage implications, especially if the weight reduction is not sustained after medications are discontinued," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This comes even as &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-adopts-new-policy-clarifying-role-bmi-measure-medicine" target="_blank"&gt;major medical organizations&lt;/a&gt; are putting less and less emphasis on BMI and as &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/59/5/339" target="_blank"&gt;new research emerges&lt;/a&gt; that shows cardiovascular fitness may be more important than body weight as a predictor of disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As I try to help my patients navigate decisions about these medications, I keep returning to the core value of bodily autonomy. Health is multidimensional and deeply personal. My patients decide what it means to be well — with or without a GLP-1 drug.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mara Gordon is a family physician in Camden, N.J., and a contributor to NPR.

Mosquitoes can't pick up the virus from infected people, because it never reaches a high enough concentration in the blood. For this reason, humans are considered "dead-end" hosts of the La Crosse virus. (In the environment, mosquitoes pick up the virus from small mammals, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/la-crosse-encephalitis/cause-and-spread/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/la-crosse-encephalitis/cause-and-spread/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;such as squirrels and chipmunks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;The La Crosse virus can enter the human brain and attack neurons, causing severe inflammation as it does so. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: KATERYNA KON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;Around 96% of people exposed to La Crosse virus do not develop any symptoms. The small percentage who do may initially experience a fever, headache, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms can emerge &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/vector-borne-diseases/mosquito-borne-diseases/mosquito-borne-diseases-of-concern/la-crosse-encephalitis.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/vector-borne-diseases/mosquito-borne-diseases/mosquito-borne-diseases-of-concern/la-crosse-encephalitis.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;within three to 10 days&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of being bitten by an infected mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, especially children under 16, these symptoms can then progress to more severe disease. For instance, the virus may cause brain &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, known as encephalitis. Around 75% of the La Crosse cases that involve encephalitis occur in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fatality rate from La Crosse encephalitis is less than 1%. However, between 5% and 15% of patients who recover from this condition can go on to experience recurring seizures after the initial infection has passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatments:&lt;/strong&gt; There is no cure for La Crosse virus disease, nor a vaccine that can help prevent infection.

								&lt;input type="hidden" id="article_url" value="2025/04/24/a-torrent-of-infectious-diseases-is-erupting-from-melting-ice-we-shouldnt-freak-out-just-yet/"&gt;
																	
																
								&lt;p&gt;You may feel that we all have enough to worry about, and thus have no need for the spectre of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/10/30/zombies-in-nature-halloween-science/" target="_blank"&gt;zombie-like reanimated bacteria&lt;/a&gt; or viruses in thawing permafrost that set off a story straight out of a sci-fi flick. Unfortunately, it's a looming reality thanks to climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, scientists tell us that while it's high time we thought carefully about how we are going to manage the vast numbers of microbes being released along with equally vast quantities of melting ice and thawing permafrost as a result of global heating, there is no need to panic nor to sensationalize the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Salon spoke with microbiologist Luis Andrés Yarzábal, an associate professor at the Universidad Católica de Cuenca in Ecuador, he was indeed careful to avoid sensationalizing the problem. But he noted that we've been aware since the '80s of dramatic quantities of microbes found in even the most pristine of Antarctic ice sheets or on top of mountains, such as the Andean glaciers, and in permafrost. The host of life on ice includes bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, even microscopic animals like nematodes, some dead and some alive in suspended animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yarzábal actually started studying the microbiology of the Andean glaciers, beginning in Venezuela 17 years ago, because he and his team were interested in the biotechnological potential of cold-loving, or psychrophile, microorganisms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They can be used, for instance, for agricultural purposes, to improve agriculture in cold regions, in mountainous regions." But the country's glaciers melted, and as they did, it revealed huge numbers of pathogens in the melting ice. Some of these disease-causing bugs may be so old, human immune systems are totally naïve to them, which means unleashing them could infect millions, maybe even trigger another pandemic. The odds of such an event may be remote — we don't actually know how likely this all is — but we do know the likelihood isn't zero and it will increase as the world's ice retreats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Venezuela is now the first country in the modern world to have lost all its glaciers, and there were many, many pathogens," Yarzábal said. Some are very similar to modern human pathogens. From bioprospecting beneficial microbes, he was now forced to consider less cheery possibilities. After all, Venezuela's lost glaciers were far from the only ones releasing water that has been frozen for tens or hundreds of thousands of years. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08545-z" target="_blank"&gt;Newly published research in Nature suggests that&lt;/a&gt; between 2000 and 2023, the world's glaciers lost some 275  gigatonnes, give or take, in mass annually, with the rate of melting increasing substantially more recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disrupting the ecological equilibrium always has the potential to cause hazards to human health directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The rate at which we lost ice during these 23 years is approximately the amount of water contained in four Olympic pools, per second. So that's a lot of microbes that will disperse around the ecosystems, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems," said Yarzábal, who &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352004313_Climate_change_melting_cryosphere_and_frozen_pathogens_Should_we_worry" target="_blank"&gt;published a 2021 review with two colleagues exploring&lt;/a&gt; existing literature regarding the consequences of such a large store of microbes being steadily released back into the environment. And that's just glaciers. There are still the thawing permafrost and melting ice sheets to take into account. All of these, however unpolluted, contain their own microbial worlds. Worlds with between ten and 100 million microbes per milliliter of ice, depending on the kind of ice, Yarzábal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are talking [altogether] about an amount of microorganisms which has been estimated between 10^25 and 10^28 microorganisms enclosed, entrapped in ice prisons ... So it's a huge amount of microorganisms ... Consider that there are 10^23 stars in the universe," Yarzábal told Salon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, he said, while many of these captive microbes are dead, plenty of them are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In this group of viable microorganisms, there are some ancient ancestral pathogens, which can also reactivate ... and they can disseminate in different ecosystems and they can, of course, infect animals, plants and other microbes," Yarzábal said. Any of these could pose a problem, whether it's because we're talking about a virus that is deadly for humans, or a bacteria that infects livestock, or a type of fungus, say, that can blight plants. Disrupting the ecological equilibrium always has the potential to cause hazards to human health directly, or to risk altering or damaging the environment we depend upon or merely appreciate for its intrinsic value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This is a fact," said Yarzábal. "So we can see it as a threat, and we can anticipate this problem by studying these pathogens or these microbes, by studying the ecology of glaciers and permafrost. It's a fact, so we must be prepared for what can happen."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Already we've had a warning of what could happen: in 2016, Siberia had &lt;span&gt;an extremely hot summer. The permafrost melted, exposing in the process the frozen carcasses of reindeer who had died an estimated 150 years before thanks to an epidemic of anthrax. While the animals were dead, some of the bacteria in them had remained alive, and when curious living reindeer came into contact with the remains of their frozen ancestors, they became infected with the spore-forming bacteria, &lt;em&gt;Bacillus anthracis&lt;/em&gt;. As Yarzábal told Salon, almost 2,500 animals died and many hundreds of people (who, in this area, are in close contact with reindeer, relying on them as a source of protein for food and commerce) became infected, with at least one small human child dying as a result.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="Permafrost under the layer of soil" class="inserted_image" data-image_id="15056106" id="featured_image_img" src="https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/600/https://media2.salon.com/2025/02/permafrost_under_the_layer_of_soil_2196693440.jpg"&gt;&lt;strong class="article_img_desc insert_image"&gt;Permafrost under the layer of soil (Getty Images/Stasz D Sirotkin)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;While Yarzábal is at work in the Southern hemisphere, in the far North, Dr. &lt;span&gt;Emilie Andersen-Ranberg, senior veterinarian at the Department for Veterinary Clinical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen, has been studying Arctic pathogens that are zoonotic, meaning they cause illnesses that can spread between animals and humans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not all zoonotic pathogens in the Arctic are frozen, mind you, and not all frozen pathogens in the Arctic are zoonotic. But about three quarters of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; human infectious diseases are zoonotic, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808746/#:~:text=Although%20about%2060%25%20of%20novel,40%25%20have%20other%20origins2." target="_blank"&gt;including the majority of novel epidemics and pandemics in recent years&lt;/a&gt;, and there's overlap with the issue of thawing permafrost. In &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969724070268?via%3Dihub&amp;amp;__cf_chl_tk=JOFT_HErB.9yw0pWk.DTtI5Sf1yVWIWXfqdpLZQn.dE-1744945773-1.0.1.1-NUJH6yIoBmeBgX8RkqnPSbEazvn3SqtT3ylZR4HHw0c" target="_blank"&gt;a paper published in December&lt;/a&gt;, Andersen-Ranberg and a host of co-authors describe zoonotic viruses, bacteria and parasites of concern in the Arctic, arguing that "&lt;/span&gt;the Arctic represents a changing world where pollution, loss of biodiversity and habitat, and maritime activity are likely driving forward occurrence of infectious diseases", with thawing permafrost being one factor among many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How concerned should we really be about thawing zoonotic infections? In an email interview, Andersen-Ranberg told Salon that's not exactly clear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is not necessarily grounds to fear that the viruses in the frozen environment are more pathogenic&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We simply don’t exactly know. There is, however, a clear theoretical risk since glaciers and permafrost are melting and they store millennia old microbes and some of these organisms have been found to revive and re-function after thawing," she said. "For example, a wide array of both RNA and DNA viruses have been detected in thawing permafrost and have been able to re-activate, [such as] RNA viruses that are highly similar to viruses that today infect mammals. On the other hand, we are constantly exposed to potentially pathogenic viruses from various natural sources, and there is not necessarily grounds to fear that the viruses in the frozen environment are more pathogenic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She did note, however, that thawing permafrost could re-introduce ancient pathogenic viruses that are now extinct, or where today's strains have evolved to have such a different genetic makeup that our (or other mammals') immune systems are less able to detect and fight off the ancient strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such pathogens would be unknown to our immune systems, as smallpox was to the immune systems of the Indigenous people who &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2013/05/04/a_lost_plague_remembering_canadas_smallpox_epidemic_partner/" target="_blank"&gt;encountered it as a result of European colonizers&lt;/a&gt; who brought the virus to the Americas, Australasia and elsewhere, leading to mass deaths from succeeding waves of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not just the resurgence of ancient diseases, but the fact that pathogens can and will trade genetic information if they come into contact with one another, a process known as viral recombination. Bacteria are also "promiscuous," easily exchanging genetic material. This could allow them to acquire genes from frozen pathogens that confer &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/07/12/climate-change-could-return-us-to-the-pre-antibiotic-era/" target="_blank"&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt; or greater virulence. As it's common for hosts like humans or other animals to harbor more than one infection at once, there can be plenty of opportunities for gene transfer to occur. Therefore, infectious agents released from melting ice "represents an even greater pool of genetic viral diversity to be introduced in already circulating viral populations," Andersen-Ranberg explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This for example means more potential ways to avoid the immune system of the host, or an increased ability to infect a variety of hosts," Andersen-Ranberg added. "Moreover, this melt-induced introduction of potential pathogens occurs simultaneously with other great changes to disease dynamics worldwide currently occurring due to climate change and changing human activities.

&lt;p&gt;So what can or should we be doing about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I don't know," Yarzábal acknowledged soberly. That is, beyond what he already recommended — we must do far more to anticipate potential disease outbreaks or reoccurrences and to understand the specific pathogens we're likely to encounter. The microbiologist is not sure what other action we might take, practically-speaking, as vast areas of ice and permafrost unleash the microorganisms they've been hanging onto all these years. Unless we reduce emissions enough to keep some of those frozen pathogens in ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Aerial view above the glaciers melting into the permafrost of Jostedalsbreen National Park" class="inserted_image" data-image_id="15050676" id="featured_image_img" src="https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/600/https://media2.salon.com/2024/06/glacial_melt_rivers_lakes_jostedalsbreen_national_park_1784183054.jpg"&gt;&lt;strong class="article_img_desc insert_image"&gt;Aerial view above the glaciers melting into the permafrost of Jostedalsbreen National Park (Getty Images/MICHAEL WORKMAN)&lt;/strong&gt;Beyond that, this is a genie that can't be put back in its bottle, only monitored and managed as it plays its tricks. But that monitoring and containment of potential disease outbreaks will be absolutely critical to protect us. In 2019, the European Academies Science Advisory Council &lt;a href="https://easac.eu/fileadmin/PDF_s/reports_statements/Climate_Change_and_Health/EASAC_CCH_Main_Report_WEB_2August.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;issued a report&lt;/a&gt; that noted that pathogen release of infectious disease from thawing permafrost was one among various ways climate change could affect human health in Europe. And that same year, EASAC along with the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and InterAcademy Partnership, a global network of science, engineering and medicine societies, brought researchers and public health officials together from North America, the European Union and Russia to assess the current state of knowledge and gaps in knowledge relating to the risks similarly posed by infectious agents in thawing Arctic permafrost and ice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we really need much more scientific investigation to understand the degree of threat such pathogens may pose to human, animal and ecosystem health, Yarzábal said. Meanwhile, the Arctic Council, which brings together Arctic countries and Indigenous Arctic communities to share knowledge and discuss policy affecting the region, &lt;a href="https://cphpost.dk/2024-07-01/news/politics/denmark-will-chair-the-arctic-council-in-2025-what-is-it-up-against/" target="_blank"&gt;has been weakened in recent years by&lt;/a&gt; political divisions, and different nations' territorial ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"To me, there is a mind-blowing gap between the knowledge and worries of scientists and the opinions and aims of decision makers, i.e. an incongruent relationship between knowledge and political realities," Andersen-Ranberg told Salon. "I find this most noteworthy, because there is such relatively little emphasis on and monitoring of zoonoses as well as emerging/reemerging disease in the Arctic — an area subjected to the greatest degree of climate change in the world which currently drastically changes disease dynamics."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's produced by a specific strain of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, distinct from the strains associated with infections like diarrhoea. This finding offers a new avenue for understanding and potentially addressing the concerning trend of bowel cancer in younger demographics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers, including from the UK and backed by &lt;a href="/topic/cancer-research-uk"&gt;Cancer Research UK&lt;/a&gt;, found that exposure to colibactin in early &lt;a href="/topic/childhood"&gt;childhood&lt;/a&gt; imprints a genetic signature on the DNA of bowel cells, which may then &lt;a href="/topic/increase"&gt;increase&lt;/a&gt; the risk of developing bowel cancer before the age of 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2"

biggest rise, averaging a 3.6% increase every year in the decade up to 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data provided by Cancer Research UK up to 2019 further suggests that bowel cancer has seen a 52% increase in incidence rates for adults aged 25 to 49 since the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div

aged 25-49 in the UK every year and around 44,100 new cases among all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work has been ongoing to discover why more younger people are developing bowel cancer, with experts believing poor diet, more ultra-processed foods, obesity and a lack of exercise are playing a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in the latest study, led by the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and published in the journal Nature, researchers have uncovered another possible culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts examined 981 colorectal (bowel) cancer genomes from patients with both early and late-onset disease in 11 different countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found colibactin can leave behind specific patterns of DNA mutations that are 3.3 times more common in early-onset bowel cancer cases (in the study this was adults under 40) than in those diagnosed after the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mutation patterns were also particularly common in countries with a higher rate of early-onset bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1kgrxrh-0 IuFeK"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-1kgrxrh-3 bCcmfs"&gt;Symptoms of bowel cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="sc-1kgrxrh-4 gFApdk"&gt;According to The NHS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1kgrxrh-5 iJEtqr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of bowel cancer may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;changes in your poo, such as having softer poo, diarrhoea or constipation that is not usual for you &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;needing to poo more or less often than usual for you &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;blood in your poo, which may look red or black &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;bleeding from your bottom &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;often feeling like you need to poo, even if you've just been to the toilet &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;tummy pain &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a lump in your tummy &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;bloating &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;losing weight without trying &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;feeling very tired for no reason &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowel cancer can cause anaemia (when you have fewer red blood cells than usual), which can make you feel very tired, short of breath and have headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author, Ludmil Alexandrov, a professor at UCSD, said: “These mutation patterns are a kind of historical record in the genome, and they point to early-life exposure to colibactin as a driving force behind early-onset disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study first author Marcos Diaz-Gay, a former postdoctoral researcher, said: “When we started this project, we weren’t planning to focus on early-onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our original goal was to examine global patterns of colorectal cancer to understand why some countries have much higher rates than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But as we dug into the data, one of the most interesting and striking findings was how frequently colibactin-related mutations appeared in the early-onset cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that colibactin-related mutations account for around 15% of what are known as APC driver mutations – some of the earliest genetic alterations that directly promote cancer development – in bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone acquires one of these driver mutations by the time they’re 10 years old, they could be decades ahead of schedule for developing colorectal cancer, getting it at age 40 instead of 60,” Professor Alexandrov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is part of Cancer Grand Challenges team Mutographs, funded by Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now developing early detection tests that analyse stool samples for colibactin-related mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director of Cancer Grand Challenges, Dr David Scott, said: “Globally and in the UK, we’re witnessing an alarming increase in some types of cancer in people under the age of 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is unlikely that there will be one clear driver but Cancer Grand Challenges scientists are racing to solve this puzzle, and our Mutographs team has uncovered a surprising clue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many early-onset colorectal cancer patients appear to have been exposed to a toxin, called colibactin, produced by some strains of the bacteria E. coli in early life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s unclear how the exposure originates, but we suspect that a combination of factors – including diet – may intersect during a crucial phase in the development of the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study adds an important piece to the puzzle of early-onset cancers, but it isn’t conclusive, and more research will be needed to establish a definitive link between colibactin and an increased risk of early-onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other Cancer Grand Challenges teams, like Optimisticc and Prospect, are looking deeper into the microbiome and other environmental factors to uncover what’s behind the global rise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr

class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-69eaed10-207d-11f0-b31c-6f6c22fda53e"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, Irvine created lab-grown immune cells that can track down toxic brain buildup and clear it away, restoring memory and brain function in mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They did this by turning&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14583499/dire-wolf-species-deextinction-animals-revived.html"&gt; stem cells — which can become any cell in the body —&lt;/a&gt; into brain immune cells called microglia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The edited cells were able to clear the junk without harming healthy tissue, leading to reduced inflammation and a dramatic improvement in brain performance in mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The treatment could mark the start of a whole &lt;a target="_self" class=""

class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 7 million Americans are living with &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-801f6f70-207d-11f0-b31c-6f6c22fda53e"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; today, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Current treatments can only slow symptoms — not reverse them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Human trials are still several years off, but the early results have scientists buzzing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the therapy works in people like it did in mice, it could rewrite the future of brain health, the team said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers developed this new therapy by turning stem cells into immune cells called microglia (pictured) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results suggest that the researchers have overcome one of the biggest hurdles to treating degenerative brain diseases: getting medicine past the blood-brain barrier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This protective layer of cells lines the inner surfaces of the blood vessels inside the brain and functions as a sort of gateway, keeping harmful substances out and keep helpful ones in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Traditional cell-based treatments have failed to bypass this barrier, but the microglia don't have to because they are already present inside the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We've developed a programmable, living delivery system that gets around that problem by residing in the brain itself and responding only when and where it's needed,' said co-author and professor of neurobiology Mathew Blurton-Jones in a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.uci.edu/2025/04/21/engineered-microglia-show-promise-for-treating-alzheimers-other-brain-diseases/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typical microglia both help and hurt the progression of Alzheimer's disease. When plaque begins to build up in the brain, they spring into action, releasing enzymes to break it down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But over time, they begin to run amok, triggering inflammation and damaging neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blurton-Jones and his colleagues found a way to create microglia that treat brain damage without making it worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, they grew human microglia from stem cells, then used CRISPR gene editing — a technique that allows scientists to make precise changes to a cell's DNA — to reprogram the way they function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The modified microglia reduced brain plaques (pictured in orange) without damaging neurons and synapses (pictured in green)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plaques disrupt normal brain function by interfering with cell signaling, thus driving cognitive decline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The modified microglia secrete neprilysin, an enzyme that breaks down brain plaque, only when they are actually near a plaque. This prevents them from accidentally  harming critical, healthy parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plaques disrupt normal brain function by interfering with cell signaling, thus driving cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because the therapeutic protein was only produced in response to amyloid plaques, this approach was highly targeted yet broadly effective,' said lead-author Jean Paul Chadarevian, a postdoctoral researcher in the Blurton-Jones' lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This work opens the door to a completely new class of brain therapies,' said Robert Spitale, co-author and professor of pharmaceutical sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Instead of using synthetic drugs or viral vectors, we're enlisting the brain's immune cells as precision delivery vehicles.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This new therapy could give hope to Alzheimer's patients and their families, but it will have to go through multiple rounds of rigorous testing before it can be used to treat humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers noted that there is still a lot of work to be done to translate their microglial-based therapy into human trials, including demonstrating long-term safety and charting a path toward scalable manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But that latter hurdle could be addressed by producing microglia from the patient's own stem cells, which would also reduce the risk of the immune system rejecting them, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This has been done to treat other types of diseases, such as blood cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, it can take about three to five years for a treatment that's successful in mice to go to human trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Apple’s weather app, too, showed that the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/air-quality-index.html" title=""&gt;Air Quality Index&lt;/a&gt; had climbed into the 400s, a reading so hazardous that people are encouraged to stay indoors. (The Air Quality Index, which ranges from 0 to 500, is a measure of the density of five pollutants in the air: &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.epa.gov/ground-level-ozone-pollution/ground-level-ozone-basics#effects" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;ground-level ozone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;particulates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.epa.gov/co-pollution" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.epa.gov/no2-pollution" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;nitrogen dioxide&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.epa.gov/so2-pollution" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;sulfur dioxide&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;To put that in perspective, that’s as high as the levels reached in 2023 when smoke from wildfires in Canada blanketed much of the East Coast and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/nyregion/nyc-wildfire-smoke-scenes.html" title=""&gt;turned the sky in New York City orange&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;At those levels, people are advised to stay indoors, and Madeline Blair, 24, did just that. She checked her Apple weather app when she woke up and, seeing unhealthy air quality levels, skipped her morning walk.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ST. LOUIS — Missouri's first measles case was confirmed last week. A child tested positive in Taney County after international travel. There have been no cases reported in Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately we don't have any treatment for measles," reports SSM Health Cardinal Glennon Pediatric Infectious Disease Physician Dr. Zacharoula Oikonomopoulou, "Its attack rate is close to 90% and this is more than flu and COVID-19."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Oikonomopoulou says most people don't realize they or someone in their household has measles, "It's going to present initially with cough that is usually dry, runny nose and watery red eyes." &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial symptoms of measles are generic. Dr. Oikonomopoulou says the tell-tale rash develops within three to five days, "(a) rash that is going to start from your head all the way to the bottom, accompanied by a very high fever up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sneaky start of measles is a likely contributor to its recent spread in the U.S. "It is important to know that you are contagious four days before to four days after the development of that rash," explains Dr. Oikonomopoulou. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, three children have died in the United States. "Before these deaths were reported in 2025 and we have two confirmed deaths right now and one that likely was linked to measles, the most recent death was back in 2015," reports Dr. Oikonomopoulou.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Oikonomopoulou says measles is preventable, "The most effective way is to be vaccinated with two doses. If you don't know your vaccination status I would urge you to check your records or talk to your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

(WPDE) — &lt;/span&gt;About a dozen neighbors who live on Doe Trail in Dillon County believe the material on the road is making them sick with major breathing problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"This stuff is hazardous  to us. We breathe this stuff. And everybody in the community. In this area. Chronic breathing problems. Everybody is sick to death. We can’t keep breathing this. If we continue to keep breathing this stuff. We all gonna be dead back here," said Erika Nelson. "It feels like it’s sticking to your lungs. And you can’t breathe. So, we just go in the house until he comes down. It’s a coincidence that everybody’s got this. I can’t say that this is causing it or not. Because I’m not in the medical field. But, it’s mighty strange, since they put that on the road, everybody starting to have health problems with breathing and stuff," said JoJo Hunt.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neighbors said the material on the road was a cheaper alternative to paving it, but they feel as if they're paying a price when it comes to their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do take two breathing twice a day. And I do try to stay out of this dust. But, when you drive on this road, the dust flies up. In your house. You can’t even leave your doors open. I went to open my refrigerator to clean it up and I had dust, this here dust,  inside the refrigerator. It be all over your floors. And we need something done," said Deb Dula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can be laying down at night . And in the middle of the night, you've got to get up. And run outside to get air. Because you can't breathe in your own house," said Anthony Parsley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erika Nelson said she's started a petition to have the material removed altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODAY: &lt;a href="https://wpde.com/news/local/construction-site-robeson-county-arrests-theft-stolen-goods-fairmont" target="_blank" title="https://wpde.com/news/local/construction-site-robeson-county-arrests-theft-stolen-goods-fairmont" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Construction site theft leads to meth arrest in Robeson Co.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that nearly everyone she's talked with who has signed the petition has complained that the dust from the material has impacted their breathing and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm a witness because I do it every night. Coughing up mucus and stuff. And coughing real bad. Sometimes I’ll be thinking I may have to go to the hospital. Because I can’t hardly breathe at night. Got to sleep on my stomach to get to breathing right. Ride down this road and see all the dust clouds that come up in the air. It’s not good for our breathing. And for our health. Dust, it gets all in your house. All in your vehicle. All under your tires. Your car be purely white. White, like snow," said Nelson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunt said he spent more than $300 to have the material tested at a state-certified laboratory in Florence, and that company sent the sample off for further testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunt shared the results of the laboratory of the results with ABC 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results from the sample taken from Doe Trail show a "mixture of composed primarily of calcium carbonate in the form of calcite and limestone and silicon dioxide in the form of quartz."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also said other minerals, composed of calcium sulfate and aluminum oxide, were also detected in small amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a laboratory report, the minerals detected in the powder is consistent with those typically found in powdered cement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dillon County Administrator Tim Harper said they put down a Marine-grade limestone-based course on Doe Trail in October of 2020 because it was a cheaper option than  paving it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harper said  it's been approved by the S.C. Department of Transportation (SCDOT) and they've placed it on 42 roads in the county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added they've received complaints from neighbors on Doe Trail and in response, they're working with the Dillon County Transportation Committee (CTC) and checking with other counties to see what they've done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harper added they'll be scheduled in May to apply a calcium chloride solution to the road to help cut down on all the dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He shared information with ABC 15 from a website on calcium chloride to help with dust control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information says calcium chloride is one of the most "effective dust control and dust suppression agents in the industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neighbors are hoping that it will work because they said they can hardly walk in their yard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Hunt said he's not taking any chances and may not be around to see if the solution works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bad enough that I’m fixing to put this place up for sale and get out of here,” said Hunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WPDE</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:19:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxOb0hKeDRvVGFuVE9IVXQ3dkkzLTZuLThLcEF2OVlNTjlfZzJudjVlSjRlSlYzcjZWSjBWQmJvUnNlbU9VVmprNVNuUTV5UURyMVM2RFNYSVd2R0xRRG15emxjcElrTkV4OWkxRzlSOG1sYi1VcGdPdGM0RzJRMjh0U25POExZWHJXVU9kNkJrRTdOM3FRNU1HOGgxcWJpRFZvUGlUeDNZSnROd1N4ZFREQkxNLWoxMG9HaldYTDc2Uy1rbUN6Rl9vcmZwOEJ2U3A5dUZhTQ</guid></item><item><title>世卫组织、联合国儿童基金会、全球疫苗和免疫联盟-世界卫生组织（世卫组织）警告，疫苗可预防疾病暴发的增加威胁到多年的进展 | Increases in vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks threaten years of progress, warn WHO, UNICEF, Gavi - World Health Organization (WHO)</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2gFBVV95cUxPUlA4OFJCNTc3TUdHTnlydzBIaWJJLVI4YnlyT2tGZUotWV96c0VvODZZT0hUOGROYzA0R0pwUGRDaXp0aWVGbWl5azNYRHdVZ0dHSXlrbjlBVGQ4NVBDR1NmQWxIdi05QVZhT19jV3RHWUpqemt4RV83Mk1CTmtWSmgzOEZJXzBhc25pSGsyTy1ZbmRyTTRtZVcyVWI1dHF5NTFoVXVOZFZac1A3eEhKR0tTYlJYTGdDOFFfU3pUNmZxdDlQazdWeEFxcDlzTlN0czFILUhGRmxSZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunization efforts are under growing threat as misinformation, population growth, humanitarian crises and funding cuts jeopardize progress and leave millions of children, adolescents and adults at risk, warn WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi during World Immunization Week, 24–30 April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, meningitis and yellow fever are rising globally, and diseases like diphtheria, that have long been held at bay or virtually disappeared in many countries, are at risk of re-emerging. In response, the agencies are calling for urgent and sustained political attention and investment to strengthen immunization programmes and protect significant progress achieved in reducing child mortality over the past 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines have saved more than 150 million lives over the past five decades,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Funding cuts to global health have put these hard-won gains in jeopardy. Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases are increasing around the world, putting lives at risk and exposing countries to increased costs in treating diseases and responding to outbreaks. Countries with limited resources must invest in the highest-impact interventions – and that includes vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rising outbreaks and strained health systems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is making an especially dangerous comeback. The number of cases has been increasing year on year since 2021, tracking the reductions in immunization coverage that occurred during and since the COVID-19 pandemic in many communities. Measles cases reached an estimated 10.3 million in 2023, a 20% increase compared to 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agencies warn that this upward trend likely continued into 2024 and 2025, as outbreaks have intensified around the world. In the past 12 months, 138 countries have reported measles cases, with 61 experiencing large or disruptive outbreaks – the highest number observed in any 12-month period since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meningitis cases in Africa also rose sharply in 2024, and the upward trend has continued into 2025. In the first three months of this year alone, more than 5500 suspected cases and nearly 300 deaths were reported in 22 countries. This follows approximately 26 000 cases and almost 1400 deaths across 24 countries last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellow fever cases in the African region are also climbing, with 124 confirmed cases reported in 12 countries in 2024. This comes after dramatic declines in the disease over the past decade, thanks to global vaccine stockpiles and use of yellow fever vaccine in routine immunization programmes. In the WHO Region of the Americas, yellow fever outbreaks have been confirmed since the beginning of this year, with a total of 131 cases in 4 countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These outbreaks come amidst global funding cuts. A recent &lt;a href="/publications/m/item/the-impact-of-suspensions-and-reductions-in-health-official-development-assistance-on-health-systems"&gt;WHO rapid stock take&lt;/a&gt; with 108 country offices of WHO – mostly in low- and lower-middle-income countries – shows that nearly half of those countries are facing moderate to severe disruptions to vaccination campaigns, routine immunization and access to supplies due to reduced donor funding. Disease surveillance, including for vaccine-preventable diseases, is also impacted in more than half of the countries surveyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the number of children missing routine vaccinations has been increasing in recent years, even as countries make efforts to catch up children missed during the pandemic. In 2023, an estimated 14.5 million children missed all of their routine vaccine doses – up from 13.9 million in 2022 and 12.9 million in 2019. Over half of these children live in countries facing conflict, fragility, or instability, where access to basic health services is often disrupted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The global funding crisis is severely limiting our ability to vaccinate over 15 million vulnerable children in fragile and conflict-affected countries against measles,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “Immunization services, disease surveillance, and the outbreak response in nearly 50 countries are already being disrupted – with setbacks at a similar level to what we saw during COVID-19. We cannot afford to lose ground in the fight against preventable diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continued investment in the ‘Big Catch-Up initiative’, launched in 2023 to reach children who missed vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, and other routine immunization programmes will be critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How immunization addresses these challenges&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joint efforts by WHO, UNICEF, Gavi and partners have helped countries expand access to vaccines and strengthen immunization systems through primary health care, even in the face of mounting challenges. Every year, vaccines save nearly 4.2 million lives against 14 diseases – with nearly half of these lives saved in the African Region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination campaigns have led to the elimination of meningitis A in Africa’s meningitis belt, while a new vaccine that protects against five strains of meningitis holds promise for broader protection, with efforts underway to expand its use for outbreak response and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress has also been made in reducing yellow fever cases and deaths through increasing routine immunization coverage and emergency vaccine stockpiles, but recent outbreaks in Africa and in the Region of the Americas highlight the risks in areas with no reported cases in the past, low routine vaccination coverage and gaps in preventive campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the past two years have seen substantial progress in other areas of immunization. In the African Region, which has the highest cervical cancer burden in the world, HPV vaccine coverage nearly doubled between 2020 and 2023 from 21% to 40%, reflecting a concerted global effort towards &lt;a href="/initiatives/cervical-cancer-elimination-initiative"&gt;eliminating cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The progress in immunization also includes increases in global coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, particularly in the South-East Asia Region, alongside introductions in Chad and Somalia, countries with high disease burden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another milestone is the sub-national introduction of malaria vaccines in nearly 20 African countries, laying the foundation to save half a million additional lives by 2035 as more countries adopt the vaccines and scale-up accelerates as part of the tools to fight malaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Call to action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNICEF, WHO, and Gavi urgently call for parents, the public, and politicians to strengthen support for immunization. The agencies emphasize the need for sustained investment in vaccines and immunization programmes and urge countries to honour their commitments to the Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of integrated primary health-care systems, vaccination can protect against diseases and connect families to other essential care, such as antenatal care, nutrition or malaria screening. Immunization is a ‘best buy’ in health with a return on investment of $54 for every dollar invested and provides a foundation for future prosperity and health security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Increasing outbreaks of highly infectious diseases are a concern for the whole world. The good news is we can fight back, and Gavi’s next strategic period has a clear plan to bolster our defences by expanding investments in global vaccine stockpiles and rolling out targeted preventive vaccination in countries most impacted by meningitis, yellow fever and measles,” said Dr Sania Nishtar, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “These vital activities, however, will be at risk if Gavi is not fully funded for the next five years and we call on our donors to support our mission in the interests of keeping everyone, everywhere, safer from preventable diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gavi’s upcoming high-level pledging summit taking place on 25 June 2025 seeks to raise at least US$ 9 billion from our donors to fund our ambitious strategy to protect 500 million children, saving at least 8 million lives from 2026–2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#####&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes to editor:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download multimedia content here: &lt;a href="https://weshare.unicef.org/Package/2AM4086M4S1G" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;https://weshare.unicef.org/Package/2AM4086M4S1G&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About WHO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dedicated to the health and well-being of all people and guided by science, the World Health Organization leads and champions global efforts to give everyone, everywhere, an equal chance at a safe and healthy life. We are the UN agency for health. We connect nations, partners and people on the front lines in 150+ locations – leading the world’s response to health emergencies, preventing disease, addressing the root causes of health issues and expanding access to medicines and health care. Our mission is to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/home" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;www.who.int&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About UNICEF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;UNICEF works in some of the world's toughest places, to reach the world's most disadvantaged children. Across more than 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, to build a better world for everyone.

Since its inception in 2000, Gavi has helped to immunize a whole generation – over 1.1 billion children – and prevented more than 18.8 million future deaths, helping to halve child mortality in 78 lower income countries. Gavi also plays a key role in improving global health security by supporting health systems as well as funding global stockpiles for Ebola, cholera, meningococcal and yellow fever vaccines. After two decades of progress, Gavi is now focused on protecting the next generation, above all the zero-dose children who have not received even a single vaccine shot. The Vaccine Alliance employs innovative finance and the latest technology – from drones to biometrics – to save lives, prevent outbreaks before they can spread and help countries on the road to self-sufficiency.

Eating out, going to social events and travelling abroad are all fraught with anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As many as one in 200 adults and one in 50 children have a nut allergy, charities say. Some children grow out of their allergies, but many don't - and they continue into adulthood, often getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;An allergic reaction occurs when the body reacts to the protein in peanuts, thinking it's a threat, which triggers a sudden release of chemicals. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/food-allergy/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Symptoms can range from the mild to very serious&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Chris's allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Each reaction since has been worse than the one before, which means he's become accustomed to living every day "on high alert hoping nothing bad happens". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Activities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Despite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London that would change her son's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Despite being "really nervous", Chris agreed to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;From milligrams to whole nuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;In the trial, patients were started on tiny amounts of peanut powder to slowly build up their tolerance&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Under the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt.

So it provides them with some protection against that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"They've taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It's only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostly &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-64987074" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;in children&lt;/a&gt; whose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away," says Prof Till.

It has given them freedom to travel, reduced their anxiety when eating out and removed their fear of food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;How to develop this into a practical treatment on the NHS is more of a challenge. First, larger trials are needed to prove it can work for more people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And researchers are looking at whether putting drops of peanut in solution under the tongue could be a safer way of achieving the same end result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Chris now eats four peanuts every morning with his breakfast granola to keep his allergy at bay – as recommended by his doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He's grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the trial and hopes many others with serious peanut allergies can also benefit from the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While he admits he still hates the flavour of peanuts, he says knowing he can now eat something that once sent his body into "nuclear meltdown" has changed his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's a wonderful feeling," Chris says.

                                        Your child may fear the monster under their bed. They'd be smarter to fear the air around it, or so suggests a &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.5c00051"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/15/health/child-mattress-bedding-toxins-wellness/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; reports researchers who analyzed the air in the bedrooms of 25 kids between the ages of 6 months and 4 years found "worrisome" levels of more than two dozen phthalates, flame retardants, and UV filters—particularly near the bed. To determine why, they launched a &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.5c03560"&gt;companion study&lt;/a&gt; in which they evaluated 16 new lower-cost children's mattresses to determine whether they were off-gassing the chemicals. The did indeed find them to be a source of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). The &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/21/children-mattresses-toxic-chemicals-research"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; explains that semi-volatile means "they can lift off objects and seep into the air over time."
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        They then tested and confirmed an additional hypothesis: that children's body heat and weight, which is a realistic scenario, would increase emissions and hence exposures." That's "a factor that current safety standards don't consider," said Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, who was not part of the study. The researchers also noted that children's exposure to SVOCs and other environmental contaminants exceeds that of adults due to "their 10-times higher inhalation rate, 3-times larger skin surface area per body weight compared to adults, and their unique behaviors such as frequent hand-to-mouth contact and mouthing objects."

                                        "We were really shocked to find what was in the mattresses," co-author Miriam Diamond of the University of Toronto tells the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, which notes one mattress's weight was 3% flame retardant. Phthalates and flame retardants are types chemicals whose compounds have been linked to everything from cancer and hormonal disruption to lower IQs. Phthalates are generally used as plasticizers to facilitate bending and get added to plastic mattress covers, but Diamond said researchers were surprised to find them in non-plastic covers as well.

                                        As for what concerned parents can do, the chief scientific officer at the Food Packaging Forum explains her choices to CNN: "We opted for large brands that I knew had at least some chemicals policies, and tried to get natural materials—latex, cotton, merino—or buy second hand, because I figured that most chemicals that would gas out will already have gassed out."

          &lt;p&gt;No matter how bad things might seem, at least you haven't accidentally eaten fox poop and developed an insidious tapeworm infection that masquerades as a cancerous liver tumor while it slowly destroys your organs and eventually kills you—or, you &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; haven't done that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, according to &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/5/24-1608_article#suggestedcitation"&gt;a newly published study in Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;, even if you have somehow feasted on fox feces and acquired this nightmare parasite, it's looking less likely that doctors will need to hack out chunks of your organs to try to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the good news from the new study. The bad news is that, while this infection is fairly rare, it appears to be increasing. And, if you do get it, you might have a shorter lifespan than the uninfected and may be sicker in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meet the fox tapeworm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study is a retrospective one, in which a group of doctors in Switzerland examined medical records of 334 patients who developed the disease alveolar echinococcosis (AE) over a 50-year span (1973–2022). AE is an understudied, life-threatening infection caused by the fox tapeworm, &lt;em&gt;Echinococcus multilocularis&lt;/em&gt;. The parasite is not common, but can be found throughout the Northern Hemisphere, particularly regions of China and Russia, and countries in continental Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/echinococcosis/index.html"&gt;In the parasite's intended lifecycle&lt;/a&gt;, adult intestinal worms release eggs into the feces of their primary host—foxes, or sometimes coyotes, dogs, or other canids. The eggs then get ingested by an intermediate host, such as voles. There, eggs develop into a spherical embryo with six hooks that pierce through the intestinal wall to migrate to the animal's organs, primarily the liver. Once nestled into an organ, the parasites develop into multi-chambered, thin-walled cysts—a proliferative life stage that lasts indefinitely. As more cysts develop, the mass&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/echinococcosis/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt; looks and acts like cancer&lt;/a&gt;, forming necrotic cavities and sometimes metastasizing to other organs, such as the lungs and brain. The parasite remains in these cancerous-like masses, waiting for a fox to eat the cyst-riddled organs of its host. Back in a fox, the worms attach to the intestines and grow into adults.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Parents on Wednesday were notified of a whooping cough case at a Wake County school.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to the Wake County Public School System, Leesville Road High School sent a letter to parents stating the county had confirmed a case of pertussis, known as whooping cough, among one of its students.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Whooping cough is a respiratory infection caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. It is characterized by intense coughing fits that can end with a “whooping” sound when someone exhales.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms can include a runny nose, low fever, coughing that gets worse over time an apnea.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/whooping-cough-wake-county-school-march-2025/"&gt;the county detected whooping cough in a student at Oberlin Middle School&lt;/a&gt;. The Department of Health and Human Services said there were 106 cases of whooping cough in the first three months of 2025, which they say is a 106% increase from the same time period in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state added that they are seeing whooping cough infections across all age groups, with the highest frequency among school-aged children and the highest rate among infants. While anyone can catch whooping cough, it can be dangerous among babies and children.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state also said only 49% of the cases have been up to date on their vaccinations, which doctors is the best but not perfect way to prevent whooping cough infections.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Doctors also say it’s best to treat whooping cough with antibiotics as soon as possible so it won’t become more serious and prevent the spread of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The CDC provided the following suggestions for managing the illness at home while you’re child is recovering:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take antibiotics exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your home free from things that cause coughing like:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dust.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chemical fumes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use a clean, cool mist humidifier to loosen mucus and soothe the cough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat small meals every few hours to help prevent vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get plenty of fluids, including water, juices, and fruits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/drive.google.com/file/d/1kA-EBWKlOQ1RuARHzUiXyNrXnWI7up3Q/view?usp=drive_link__;!!M5erwxGTI6mlTHJSECWB8LY!HtDs-QvGX-K_0ZOJz1GnBjXBZ-k1VsOcHxBxnQu0jYLJOIs1Xj--BQmu5RaCtU3RzXsNkuWqMMY$"&gt;Wake County Health Services also sent a letter to families&lt;/a&gt; for any further questions on whooping cough. In the letter Leesville Road High School sent to parents, the school said it is taking every measure to ensure the health and safety of its students.&lt;/p&gt;

There were 514,000 new cases of dementia among Americans in 2020, but that will rise to 730,000 in 2030 and 1.03million in 2060.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers from Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital in Anyang, South Korea, reviewed health insurance data from 2million people between 40 and 60 years old. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They analyzed records from doctors appointments that included waist circumference, blood pressure, blood sugar and triglyceride and cholesterol levels. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of those included in the study, published in the journal Neurology, 25 percent had metabolic syndrome. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over a follow-up period of eight years, nearly 9,000 people - 0.45 percent - developed some form of dementia before the age of 65. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Data revealed women with metabolic syndrome were at a higher risk of early-onset dementia - 34 percent - compared to men - 15 percent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, people in their 40s were more at risk than people in their 50s. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Currently nearly 8million Americans currently have some form of dementia and there are around 500,000 new cases diagnosed per year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alzheimer's is the most common form - with 7million diagnoses - but as the aging population of the US continues to grow, so will diagnoses. By 2050, the number of Alzheimer's patients is projected to rise to nearly 13 million.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Estimates for the growth previously projected the number of Alzheimer's patients to rise to nearly 13million by 2050 (illustrated above), but NYU's new research has far higher predictions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the main cause of the dementia is still debated, scientists believe the disease is likely to be the result of an abnormal build-up of proteins - amyloid and tau - in and around brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Alzheimer's patients, amyloid proteins are not effectively cleared from the body and eventually form plaques in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, tau proteins detach from neurons and form tangles, causing neurons to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When neurons die, messages can't be delivered as effectively throughout the brain, which scientists believe is what causes the thinking difficulties in dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genetics also play a strong role in the risk of Alzheimer's and in 2022 researchers identified 31 new genes that appear to affect processes that play a role in the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for dementia - only medications and therapies to control symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To ward off metabolic syndrome, the researchers said people should follow a healthy diet, exercise regularly, maintain a healthy weight, quit smoking and reduce stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while this study has begun to look at the relationship between metabolic syndrome and early dementia, study author Dr Minwoo Lee said more needs to be done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Future research that follows people over longer periods of time and uses brain scans to look for biomarkers of dementia is needed to confirm and expand upon our findings.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 20:07:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPalJnYTRISm9sWmI5WklRZnoxbG5fRHJHZ0NDWkdScWEtc2hPTUN1aTQzSDZ4V3RUVWw2X1lIREVvdDVTcVRfS3JGQ1k1UjFfMVV0X09lWWJZbTVGU1pDejIybC1zVW55YjF1Uy02QUg3aTQwaWxVcV9mMUs2MkpzVTN6WjJSWFdZMURSRzhQSmtJQUZtQ3V5cWhSaGFCNmvSAaQBQVVfeXFMTThFZzdZeUhZbDdxbDhnV01pZFdUVjhvT2ZiSXF6YzdlNGcwTmxsYmFsODRjbGg1MHJITWRsMTZaZEpRbW8xTk02UGdtVVBQQnpUbEE5N1hUZXFTOEZTMWJXd1QtenNkTzFaMXRQbXlwVEFXc3NFX3huaTRnbU9UVnJwZmFRc2pNTE94bzF0YVNuWnN4bVlNOGxwVEltUFRud0JYYmQ</guid></item><item><title>融化的北极冰可能释放古老的致命疾病，科学家警告-SciTechDaily | Melting Arctic Ice May Unleash Ancient Deadly Diseases, Scientists Warn -

Researchers analyzed the markers of metabolic syndrome and who developed young-onset dementia between 2009 and the end of 2020, according to the study published Wednesday in &lt;a href="https://press.aan.com/e3t/Ctc/UE+113/d5xxPS04/VWhNl35WRnpcW4DJn9n3rHR9vW6phD5r5vvpw0N6B8NrC5kvg0W8wM7ks6lZ3p5W1gM7Z994z87_W6TT11R2yX22XVhrQlN3px4zdW61Yr8N829MVJW3Nsqd962kw_KN4QGx59Cc91GN5YHPwS8cSd0N5xGy1lF99wfN6nqn-43KmQzW8hcP3x5PD95zW2_jZPb2Vl6VPW4zD0NT8-LRT1W3cmPpl3hYvPjW5w6J1w8SfpzDW1C2zl588C85-W9dGl1F63jDN9VH1pQV8dL4YXW16ZylQ6662FnW5RcShV8Lv68lW7C9D4n3bN-6XW6kNJlX3yk03xW2HVgXm45cPVcW5C0Z869bVlHqW1SB-Qw1V8ZKwW4PvCgw1CJH9fW8-RXGb5pdgvBV6d6Rc4xRxHYW3Ktt5s49bXqyW7vd4NL86Rt1JW372VcR5B2TdLW648FwF1b7YvlW369nvn5F873XW3vKBP897QkCtW10JJf23-zJ8MVyGnYR6J8WNxW7dN4qn31g69KVCG4T-6kRBdCW4Df9Rs1my97LW4TQ2_b5YVBMqVzcnJx7HlccXW5BWSCT2xLQCpN8MSsgtvJR9bW29s1C05tB2j2W39YBn711tZ4lf8dQjxj04" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the journal Neurology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the journal Neurology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Each component — such as elevated blood pressure, high blood sugar, obesity, abnormal cholesterol levels — is individually linked to higher dementia risk,” said Lee, assistant professor in the department of neurology at Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The finding suggests an increased risk for much of the US population, as about 1 in 3 adults in the United States have metabolic syndrome, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Dementia is among our most feared diseases, and developing dementia at an early age is even more worrisome,” said Dr. Richard Isaacson, a preventive neurologist and director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida. He was not involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“People of all ages –– from the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and beyond –– should be empowered to make brain-healthy choices early on,” Isaacson said. “I think this study gives us more evidence to suggest that these brain-healthy choices may lead to better brain outcomes over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Causation vs. correlation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It is important to note that the study was observational, which means that researchers can’t say that metabolic syndrome caused dementia, only that there was a correlation between the two, Isaacson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I don’t really think that vascular risk factors and metabolic syndrome causes Alzheimer’s disease, but I think it can fast-forward someone towards it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More research will need to be done to determine whether treating metabolic syndrome actually delays the onset of dementia or reduces the number of cases, Isaacson said. Researchers will also need to look into more populations to see if the results from South Korea can be broadly applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But the latest study does give hope that there are actions people can take to combat young-onset dementia, he said. “Some people say young onset-dementia, you can’t do anything about that –– it’s preordained, but I don’t agree with that. These lifestyle factors are nontrivial,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Lee believes people can influence their odds. “My advice is to proactively manage metabolic health by maintaining a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and routine medical check-ups,” he said. “Addressing metabolic syndrome early can substantially reduce the risk of dementia later in life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;The connection between vascular and brain health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The conditions that make up metabolic syndrome may not seem immediately connected to dementia risk, but there are a few ways that vascular health can impact cognitive decline, Isaacson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Metabolic syndrome can lead to inflammation, and “when someone has inflammation in the body and in the brain, it can fast-forward aging,” Isaacson said. “And when you have inflammation in the brain, things don’t work as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Your blood vessels working efficiently is also important to cognitive health to keep enough oxygen flowing to the brain, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And finally, he noted that metabolic syndrome may affect the brain’s ability to metabolize energy, which may lead to cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The different conditions that make up metabolic syndrome tend to happen together because they have similar causes and impact one another, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When a person is physically inactive and has an unhealthy diet … and someone is not sleeping and just kind of burning the candle at both ends … poor activity, low exercise: These are the medical or clinical manifestations of that sort of thing,” Isaacson said. “That’s why these risk factors often flock together — because they really are interrelated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;People can take steps to get healthy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because both genetic and lifestyle factors contribute to dementia cases, some people can do everything their doctor suggests and still get dementia, Isaacson said. But making healthy lifestyle changes and addressing metabolic syndrome may still prevent or delay dementia in many people, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Treatment for metabolic syndrome, which can also increase the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, starts with lifestyle changes, said Dr. Pam Taub, a preventive cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of California San Diego.

            How you manage a cluster of health conditions known as metabolic syndrome could have a big impact on whether you develop &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/05/health/healthy-living-dementia-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; at a young age, according to a new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo00083b6ocie0shlg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To be diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/metabolic-syndrome" target="_blank"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a person must have three of the following conditions: a large waistline, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood triglycerides, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, also known as HDL or “good” cholesterol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo00093b6oi3rx2jlz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People who had metabolic syndrome, or a combination of those components, were 24% more likely to develop dementia at a young age, the data showed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000a3b6ouxlz9kty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The key takeaway (of the study) is that metabolic syndrome significantly increases the risk of developing young-onset dementia,” which is dementia before age 65, said principal study investigator Dr. Minwoo Lee, in an email. “Our findings highlight the importance of managing metabolic health early to potentially prevent dementia and maintain brain health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000b3b6o8pssphcw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study analyzed data of nearly 2 million people from the Korean National Health Insurance Service who underwent health checkups. Researchers analyzed the markers of metabolic syndrome and who developed young-onset dementia between 2009 and the end of 2020, according to the study published Wednesday in &lt;a href="https://press.aan.com/e3t/Ctc/UE+113/d5xxPS04/VWhNl35WRnpcW4DJn9n3rHR9vW6phD5r5vvpw0N6B8NrC5kvg0W8wM7ks6lZ3p5W1gM7Z994z87_W6TT11R2yX22XVhrQlN3px4zdW61Yr8N829MVJW3Nsqd962kw_KN4QGx59Cc91GN5YHPwS8cSd0N5xGy1lF99wfN6nqn-43KmQzW8hcP3x5PD95zW2_jZPb2Vl6VPW4zD0NT8-LRT1W3cmPpl3hYvPjW5w6J1w8SfpzDW1C2zl588C85-W9dGl1F63jDN9VH1pQV8dL4YXW16ZylQ6662FnW5RcShV8Lv68lW7C9D4n3bN-6XW6kNJlX3yk03xW2HVgXm45cPVcW5C0Z869bVlHqW1SB-Qw1V8ZKwW4PvCgw1CJH9fW8-RXGb5pdgvBV6d6Rc4xRxHYW3Ktt5s49bXqyW7vd4NL86Rt1JW372VcR5B2TdLW648FwF1b7YvlW369nvn5F873XW3vKBP897QkCtW10JJf23-zJ8MVyGnYR6J8WNxW7dN4qn31g69KVCG4T-6kRBdCW4Df9Rs1my97LW4TQ2_b5YVBMqVzcnJx7HlccXW5BWSCT2xLQCpN8MSsgtvJR9bW29s1C05tB2j2W39YBn711tZ4lf8dQjxj04" target="_blank"&gt;the journal Neurology&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000c3b6oba3uwef5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Each component — such as elevated blood pressure, high blood sugar, obesity, abnormal cholesterol levels — is individually linked to higher dementia risk,” said Lee, assistant professor in the department of neurology at Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital in South Korea.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000d3b6o3j3rb4oo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The finding suggests an increased risk for much of the US population, as about 1 in 3 adults in the United States have metabolic syndrome, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000e3b6o2adgmwz6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Dementia is among our most feared diseases, and developing dementia at an early age is even more worrisome,” said Dr. Richard Isaacson, a preventive neurologist and director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida. He was not involved in the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000f3b6o89m1pek5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People of all ages –– from the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and beyond –– should be empowered to make brain-healthy choices early on,” Isaacson said.  “I think this study gives us more evidence to suggest that these brain-healthy choices may lead to better brain outcomes over time.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000g3b6op8h4f7mf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is important to note that the study was observational, which means that researchers can’t say that metabolic syndrome caused dementia, only that there was a correlation between the two, Isaacson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000h3b6om5fgxv3s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t really think that vascular risk factors and metabolic syndrome causes Alzheimer’s disease, but I think it can fast-forward someone towards it,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000i3b6ooqlvtqcy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More research will need to be done to determine whether treating metabolic syndrome actually delays the onset of dementia or reduces the number of cases, Isaacson said. Researchers will also need to look into more populations to see if the results from South Korea can be broadly applied.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000j3b6ojhdjzv3g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the latest study does give hope that there are actions people can take to combat young-onset dementia, he said. “Some people say young onset-dementia, you can’t do anything about that –– it’s preordained, but I don’t agree with that. These lifestyle factors are nontrivial,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000k3b6oonz53eyd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lee believes people can influence their odds. “My advice is to proactively manage metabolic health by maintaining a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and routine medical check-ups,” he said. “Addressing metabolic syndrome early can substantially reduce the risk of dementia later in life.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

        The connection between vascular and brain health
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000l3b6o0kkzur7e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The conditions that make up metabolic syndrome may not seem immediately connected to dementia risk, but there are a few ways that vascular health can impact cognitive decline, Isaacson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000m3b6o77yqfqzy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Metabolic syndrome can lead to inflammation, and “when someone has inflammation in the body and in the brain, it can fast-forward aging,” Isaacson said. “And when you have inflammation in the brain, things don’t work as well.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000n3b6ope1tcmfe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Your blood vessels working efficiently is also important to cognitive health to keep enough oxygen flowing to the brain, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000o3b6o7ybj8blq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And finally, he noted that metabolic syndrome may affect the brain’s ability to metabolize energy, which may lead to cognitive impairment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000p3b6oe9gg88vm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The different conditions that make up metabolic syndrome tend to happen together because they have similar causes and impact one another, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000q3b6otxfhm991@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When a person is physically inactive and has an unhealthy diet … and someone is not sleeping and just kind of burning the candle at both ends … poor activity, low exercise: These are the medical or clinical manifestations of that sort of thing,” Isaacson said. “That’s why these risk factors often flock together — because they really are interrelated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000r3b6oub6ls64m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because both genetic and lifestyle factors contribute&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to dementia cases, some people can do everything their doctor suggests and still get dementia, Isaacson said. But making healthy lifestyle changes and addressing metabolic syndrome may still prevent or delay dementia in many people, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000s3b6od03oyjqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Treatment for metabolic syndrome, which can also increase the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, starts with lifestyle changes, said Dr. Pam Taub, a preventive cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of California San Diego. She was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000t3b6odvvmam5u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In general, the lifestyle recommendations that we recommend are really having a balanced &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/01/health/mediterranean-diet-recipes-wellness/index.html"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, a diet that is balanced in terms of proteins, carbohydrates, and fiber, and also limiting the amount of calorie intake,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000u3b6obfdxbagx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some of Taub’s research into metabolic syndrome shows that time-restricted eating can help manage the conditions, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000v3b6o7ixesjvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maintaining regular physical activity is key, though the amount and the proportion of strength, cardio and flexibility training may be specific to you and discussed with your doctor, she said. Getting enough sleep and handling stress are also essential in managing almost every chronic condition, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000w3b6of0lzz2ro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Of course, we can’t control the stress that’s thrown at us, but it’s how we modulate our response that is important,” Taub said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000x3b6o2oy79lx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But lifestyle changes alone may not solve the problem completely, she said. Your doctor may recommend medications to help with blood pressure, blood sugar, insulin resistance, lipid lowering and weight management.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000y3b6o5cf0pr8b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really not one or the other,” Taub said. “You have to synergize both lifestyle and pharmacology.”

By combining brain imaging with clinical data, researchers developed machine learning models that accurately predicted treatment outcomes across two large trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding brain-based biomarkers significantly improved prediction accuracy over traditional factors like age or symptom severity. This marks a major step toward personalized, faster, and more effective treatment for depression—reducing the frustration of trial-and-error prescribing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain-Based Prediction:&lt;/strong&gt; Connectivity in a key brain region improves antidepressant outcome forecasts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Trial Success:&lt;/strong&gt; Models trained in one study accurately predicted outcomes in another.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward Personalization:&lt;/strong&gt; The findings pave the way for tailored depression treatments based on brain scans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;CAMH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding the right antidepressant treatment can be a frustrating, time-consuming process — one that often requires individuals to endure weeks of ineffective medication before trying something new. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study offers hope for a more personalized approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109053"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They found that adding a brain connectivity marker to traditional clinical data (such as age, sex and baseline depression severity) significantly improved prediction performance across both studies. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, the study reveals promising progress toward predicting how patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) will respond to antidepressant medications using brain imaging and clinical data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research demonstrated that brain connectivity patterns — specifically in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex — could significantly improve predictions of treatment response across two large, independent clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In spite of the availability of several antidepressant treatments, including medications and psychotherapy, many individuals with depression have difficulties finding the treatment that works best for them,” said Diego Pizzagalli, PhD, director of the Noel Drury, M.D. Institute for Translational Depression Discoveries at UC Irvine and Distinguished Professor at the Charlie Dunlop School of Biological Sciences and the School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a result, for many, treatment follows a trial-and-error approach. Discovering brain-based markers predicting positive antidepressant response promises to allow a more personalized treatment and thereby speed up reduction of symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using machine learning models trained on clinical and neuroimaging data from more than 350 participants in two international trials — EMBARC in the U.S. and CANBIND-1 in Canada — the researchers evaluated whether their algorithms could reliably predict who would respond to common antidepressants like sertraline and escitalopram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that adding a brain connectivity marker to traditional clinical data (such as age, sex and baseline depression severity) significantly improved prediction performance across both studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We identified a brain connectivity marker that was predictive of response to common antidepressants across two large-scale clinical trials in the U.S. and Canada,” explained Peter Zhukovsky, a former postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Pizzagalli’s laboratory and now Scientist in the Brain Health Imaging Centre at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The predictive performance of our algorithm was improved by the addition of the brain connectivity feature to clinical and demographic markers, reaching moderate levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings are promising for the search for biomarkers predicting depression response. We hope these efforts will help connect patients with treatments that are most likely to work for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also tackled the often-overlooked challenge of generalizability — whether a prediction model developed in one trial will hold up in a completely separate population. That’s where this research stands out. Models trained on one trial performed surprisingly well when tested on another, highlighting the potential for broader real-world use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Data harmonization and building a large-scale database with different treatments is challenging,” noted Zhukovsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, we’re hopeful that cross-trial analyses such as the one we conducted in this project will advance precision medicine goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s implications are far-reaching. By developing biomarkers that are not limited to one treatment setting or population, researchers are laying the groundwork for clinical tools that could eventually match patients with effective treatments earlier, potentially reducing suffering and speeding recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We investigated biomarkers predicting antidepressant treatment response,” Zhukovsky added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, many other options are available for treating depression and if we can identify markers for specific treatments, then the resulting decision support tools could be tested in biomarker-guided clinical studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mental health disorders continue to rise globally, the need for faster, data-driven treatment approaches is more urgent than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s findings underscore the promise of brain-based diagnostics to transform how depression is treated. But they also stress that more research is needed — larger trials, new treatment comparisons and real-world implementation studies — to bring these insights from the lab to the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This line of work will be one of the key priorities within the recently launched Noel Drury, M.D. Institute for Translational Depression Discoveries at UC Irvine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was made possible through a multi-institutional collaboration among researchers from McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School; the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; the New York State Psychiatric Institute; Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons; Stony Brook University; the University of Toronto; and the Centre for Depression and Suicide Studies at Unity Health Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EMBARC study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health (U01MH092221 and U01MH092250).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CAN-BIND-1 trial was conducted in partnership with, and received financial support from, the Ontario Brain Institute and the Brain-CODE platform, with partial funding from the government of Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and psychopharmacology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9be1faf8b5f8faf7ffecfef7f7dbf8faf6f3b5f8fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zachary Caldwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://camh.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CAMH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Zachary Caldwell – CAMH&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.1310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Generalizability of Treatment Outcome Prediction Across Antidepressant Treatment Trials in Depression&lt;/a&gt;” by Diego Pizzagalli et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generalizability of Treatment Outcome Prediction Across Antidepressant Treatment Trials in Depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although several predictive models for response to antidepressant treatment have emerged on the basis of individual clinical trials, it is unclear whether such models generalize to different clinical and geographical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess whether neuroimaging and clinical features predict response to sertraline and escitalopram in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) across 2 multisite studies using machine learning and to predict change in depression severity in 2 independent studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This prognostic study included structural and functional resting-state magnetic resonance imaging and clinical and demographic data from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) randomized clinical trial (RCT), which administered sertraline (in stage 1 and stage 2) and placebo, and the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CANBIND-1) RCT, which administered escitalopram. EMBARC recruited participants with MDD (aged 18-65 years) at 4 academic sites across the US between August 2011 and December 2015. CANBIND-1 recruited participants with MDD from 6 outpatient centers across Canada between August 2013 and December 2016. Data were analyzed from October 2023 to May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prediction performance for treatment response was assessed using balanced classification accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). In secondary analyses, prediction performance was assessed using observed vs predicted correlations between change in depression severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 363 adult patients (225 from EMBARC and 138 from CANBIND-1; mean [SD] age, 36.6 [13.1] years; 235 women [64.7%]), the best-performing models using pretreatment clinical features and functional connectivity of the dorsal anterior cingulate had moderate cross-trial generalizability for antidepressant treatment (trained on CANBIND-1 and tested on EMBARC, AUC = 0.62 for stage 1 and AUC = 0.67 for stage 2; trained on EMBARC stage 1 and tested on CANBIND-1, AUC = 0.66). The addition of neuroimaging features improved the prediction performance of antidepressant response compared with clinical features only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of early-treatment (week 2) instead of pretreatment depression severity scores resulted in the best generalization performance, comparable to within-trial performance. Multivariate regressions showed substantial cross-trial generalizability in change in depression severity (predicted vs observed &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; ranging from 0.31 to 0.39).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this prognostic study of depression outcomes, models predicting response to antidepressants show substantial generalizability across different RCTs of adult MDD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 19:38:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFByVzd3UG1QYkY0TGE1ejBHVllGTEJBaUpTX2JrbThsTGp3Q0tjM3UxUmNuUFZqcEpBT3hHMzhJd1pBcGQxUmlNd3UwdjI1OGk0Z3gtdThmbUxnRmpJb25rTFdvdmhZT2tqOVJBQlZn</guid></item><item><title>寄生虫会增加宫颈癌的风险，研究发现- Live Science | Parasitic worm raises risk of cervical cancer, study finds - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxPZ0dMaldIenM2eUQtc0tENEZqNUxITWV5azl6RmkzR1VpWUJfclh3WU53SzRES1FHQnFJZDQ5V2dXWG5Ub1JWREp6Vk9fVzZEamhYajBpbE5sREUtaGk1aG0xSjVsZFNXRHJBampBc3NLOTdVdUYyLVVwLXJlcDNncjYzUzZTOTliOS0yM2NMWmFJNDl5bEFRelNRQU52OEtt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;

To investigate how the worm might affect the cervix, researchers analyzed tissue samples from 39 women in Tanzania — 20 with active infections and 19 without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the infected participants received the standard treatment, a drug called praziquantel. Tissue samples were collected before this treatment and then again four to 12 months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed the tissues' gene activity, pinpointing several genes that behaved differently in infected women than in uninfected women; they also identified genes that changed their activity after the antiparasitic treatment. Four of the altered genes are known to play roles in cancer, typically by driving abnormal cell growth and tumors when their activity is turned up too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After treatment, genes involved in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and tissue repair, along with genes associated with the breakdown of the cervix's protective barriers, became more active. These changes were tied to more blood-vessel growth and less cell death, as well as to the activation of some processes seen in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in the genes that help maintain the cervix's protective barrier are "especially concerning," lead study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://globalhealth.weill.cornell.edu/fellowship/global-health-fellows" target="_blank" data-url="https://globalhealth.weill.cornell.edu/fellowship/global-health-fellows" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Anna Mertelsmann&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at University Hospital Zurich and Weill Cornell Medicine who specializes in infectious diseases and molecular oncology, said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1079324" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1079324" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "Without these, women may become more vulnerable to HPV infection and persistence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, these changes in the cervix could open the door to cancer-causing viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-the-worm-raises-cervical-cancer-risk-3"&gt;How the worm raises cervical cancer risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, when the parasite's eggs become lodged in cervical tissue, they provoke a strong inflammatory response, Mertelsmann told Live Science in an email. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-oxidative-stress" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-oxidative-stress"&gt;&lt;u&gt;This inflammation produces reactive molecules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that could damage DNA in cells in the surface of the cervix, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same mechanism is believed to lead to bladder cancer, which can occur when &lt;em&gt;S. haematobium &lt;/em&gt;eggs enter the bladder, Downs said. An estimated 40% to 70% of women and girls infected with the parasite likely have eggs lodged in the genital tract, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the carcinogenic effects of the eggs, the infection triggers repeated cycles of injury and healing that can lead to abnormal tissue growth, Mertelsmann said in an email. Simultaneously, changes in the cervix's protective barrier may impair the body's ability to detect and eliminate precancerous cells before they progress to cancer, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that praziquantel may carry risks for cancer, as it was associated with genetic changes linked to the disease. "At least shortly after treatment, the elimination of the &lt;em&gt;S. haematobium&lt;/em&gt; might at least transiently increase the risk for oncogenesis," or cancer growth, Mertelsmann told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, while the data point to these cancer-related genetic changes, "we don't know if &lt;em&gt;S. haematobium&lt;/em&gt; infection or the treatment causes or contributes to cervical cancer," she emphasized. Longer, larger studies are needed to unpack exactly how the genetic changes might impact cancer risk, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, if left untreated, &lt;em&gt;S. haematobium&lt;/em&gt; infection &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/schistosomiasis/symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/schistosomiasis/symptoms/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;can damage organs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including the lungs, intestines and spleen, so forgoing treatment would come with its own risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insights from this study could have significant implications for cancer prevention in regions where schistosomiasis is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-an-endemic-disease" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-an-endemic-disease"&gt;&lt;u&gt;endemic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Women diagnosed with &lt;em&gt;S. haematobium &lt;/em&gt;should be closely monitored for early signs of cervical tissue abnormalities," Mertelsmann said in the statement. Additional therapies, such as anti-inflammatory or immune-modulating drugs, may also help to counteract the harmful effects seen after treatment, she suggested. "Moreover, widespread HPV vaccination could play a crucial role in reducing cervical cancer risk for women affected by schistosomiasis," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the researchers are following a larger group of 180 women over a year to confirm these early results. Future studies will explore whether women with a history of schistosomiasis are more likely to develop cervical cancer due to long-term HPV infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-bQKnrmL75b7ET6oUSoWbM4-rQ0gjvUzuoFzg2PlRgqkBjzKgzqkbT5q" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-bQKnrmL75b7ET6oUSoWbM4-rQ0gjvUzuoFzg2PlRgqkBjzKgzqkbT5q slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;According to an April 23 &lt;a href="https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Public-Health-Environment/News/2025/Second-2025-Measles-Case" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment (DDPHE), a second 2025 case of measles has been confirmed in the Mile High City, this case involving an adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The press release described measles as a "highly contagious" disease, with cases often severe but preventable. The most effective way of preventing measles is through vaccination, which the majority of Americans receive – about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/measles.htm" target="_blank"&gt;91 percent of children born in 2016 were vaccinated by age two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.denver7.com/news/front-range/denver/denvers-second-measles-case-of-the-year-found-in-adult-relative-of-unvaccinated-infant" target="_blank"&gt;Denver7&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent Denver case involves a relative of an infant who was taken to Mexico while still too young to be vaccinated, bringing measles back to Colorado upon their return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as how contagious measles is, CPR reports that up to &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/04/01/colorado-below-herd-immunity-for-measles/" target="_blank"&gt;nine of every ten people&lt;/a&gt; exposed to the virus behind the disease without vaccination can be infected. Meanwhile, DDPHE reports that two doses of the MMR vaccine offer long-last protection that's &lt;a href="https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Public-Health-Environment/News/2025/Second-2025-Measles-Case" target="_blank"&gt;97 percent effective&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DDPHE press release on the matter encouraged vaccination, but also noted that there is no risk of measles to the general public regarding this new case, given that most of the public has been vaccinated for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles primarily affects the respiratory system, resulting in symptoms of fever, a cough, and a runny nose, often followed by the red rash that the disease is known for. While many people recover, it can lead to death. CPR &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/04/01/colorado-below-herd-immunity-for-measles/" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that an estimated 48,000 people were hospitalized with measles and 400 to 500 people died each year prior to when the vaccine was introduced. To help put those numbers into perspective, as of April 17 of this year, a total of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;800 cases had been confirmed&lt;/a&gt; in 2025 nationwide. Between 2020 and 2024, a single case of measles was confirmed in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High blood pressure, or hypertension, occurs when your blood presses relentlessly against your artery walls. As this pressure rises, your heart is forced to work harder than usual to pump blood through your body. Over time, this extra workload can damage blood vessels and heighten the risk of serious complications like heart attack and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Although many of these pills and powders contain naturally derived ingredients, not all are as heart-friendly and innocent as they may seem. To help protect your ticker, we reached out to a cardiologist and a cardiovascular dietitian to find out which supplements you should avoid if you have high blood pressure.

For instance, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that prolonged bitter orange use may raise systolic blood pressure (the top reading) by 6 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (the bottom reading) by 4 mmHg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This supplement may also raise the likelihood of serious complications like heart attack and stroke. Like many of the supplements on this list, bitter orange is frequently combined with other ingredients. So, label reading is critical.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-licorice-root"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Licorice Root &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Known for its distinctively sweet flavor and soothing properties, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7877890/health-benefits-of-licorice-root/#:~:text=If%20you%20decide%20to%20give,can%20lead%20to%20serious%20complications." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;licorice root&lt;/a&gt; has traditionally been used as an herbal remedy to ease digestive issues, fight viruses and soothe sore throats.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, “if you have high blood pressure, it’s best to avoid licorice supplements or products containing licorice as a secondary ingredient,” says &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiovascular dietitian and owner of Entirely Nourished. This is because licorice contains glycyrrhizic acid, a compound that can cause the body to retain sodium, potentially increasing blood pressure. One study found that even low doses of licorice root containing as little as 100 milligrams of glycyrrhizic acid may significantly raise blood pressure when consumed regularly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, licorice root has been shown to decrease potassium levels. That can lead to muscle weakness and irregular heart rhythms, putting further strain on the heart.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While some licorice root supplements claim to be free of glycyrrhizic acid, keep in mind that supplements aren’t regulated in the same way as foods. That means you may not always be getting what the label says. For instance, the above study found that the glycyrrhizic acid content of the supplement tested was actually 50% higher than the amount listed on the supplement label.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-caffeine-containing-supplements"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Caffeine-Containing Supplements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Caffeine isn’t just in your morning coffee or afternoon tea. It’s also a common ingredient in many supplements that claim to boost energy, improve alertness and enhance physical performance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, this popular stimulant can cause a temporary spike in blood pressure, making it a risky choice for those with hypertension, says Routhenstein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For instance, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that caffeine supplements raised systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2 mmHg. While this slight increase in blood pressure might seem harmless, even a small bump of around 2 mmHg can impact heart health in high-risk individuals. If you’re wondering how much is safe, we all metabolize caffeine differently, so the answer is different for everyone. Even small amounts of caffeine may spike blood pressure in some people. And the more you consume, the more those numbers climb. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to looking for caffeine on your supplement’s label, you’ll also want to keep an eye out for guarana. This caffeine-rich ingredient, often found in energy supplements and drinks, also raises heart rate and blood pressure, says Batiste.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-yohimbine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Yohimbine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yohimbine, a compound found in the bark of the yohimbe tree, is frequently found in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/herbal-teas-to-avoid-high-blood-pressure-8691951" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supplements and teas &lt;/a&gt;marketed for weight loss, athletic performance, improved sexual health and—ironically—high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Not so fast, says Batiste. “Yohimbine is a stimulant that can dangerously raise blood pressure and heart rate,” he warns. Routhenstein agrees, explaining that it increases blood pressure by raising the levels of a hormone and messenger called norepinephrine. And as norepinephrine levels rise, blood vessels begin to narrow, impairing blood flow and leading to higher blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-ephedra"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Ephedra &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ephedra is an herbal dietary supplement that has been used for centuries as a natural remedy for colds, headaches, coughs and fever, particularly in China and India. Fast-forward to the 21st century when it became a sought-after ingredient in dietary supplements promoted for weight loss, physical performance and enhanced energy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it is far from risk-free. “This herb contains ephedrine alkaloids, strong stimulant compounds linked to high blood pressure, heart attacks, strokes and even sudden death,” says Batiste. “It can also interfere with blood pressure and heart medications, making them less effective.” Due to these serious side effects, ephedra has been banned by the Food and Drug Administration for use in supplements. Although it’s banned in dietary supplements, its active ingredient, ephedrine, can be found in some allergy and asthma medications&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Therefore, you should always consult your health care provider before taking anything with ephedra listed in the ingredients.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keeping your blood pressure in check isn’t just about avoiding certain supplements. A healthy lifestyle can have a significant impact on your numbers. For instance, avoiding cigarettes and limiting alcohol are proven ways to reduce your risk of hypertension. These expert-approved tips can also help:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow the DASH Diet: &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289964/7-day-dash-diet-menu/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; (short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) has a long, solid track record for lowering blood pressure. It emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, fish, lean meats and low-fat dairy products, yet is low in trans and saturated fats and added sugars.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Regularly: &lt;/strong&gt;For better blood pressure, the American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity each week. They also suggest muscle-strengthening exercises like weight lifting at least two days per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, sleep impacts your blood pressure, too! Strive for seven to nine hours of restful sleep each night. If you snort, snore or momentarily stop breathing during the night, you may have &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7908018/sleep-apnea-can-make-heart-disease-worse-a-new-study-proves/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;, a hidden cause of high blood pressure. If that sounds familiar, speak with your doctor, who can help you find effective treatment..&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Stress: &lt;/strong&gt;Everyone is stressed out sometimes. But when stress becomes the norm, it can raise your blood pressure. Meditation, deep breathing, practicing gratitude, adopting hobbies you enjoy and connecting with friends and loved ones can all help restore calm in your life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Store shelves are filled with supplements claiming to improve your health. While some supplements may offer certain health benefits, others can raise blood pressure or negatively interact with blood pressure-lowering medications. Cardiologists and dietitians agree there are specific supplements you shouldn’t take if you have high blood pressure, especially bitter orange, licorice root, caffeine, yohimbine and ephedra. Because supplements can contain multiple ingredients, it’s especially important to take the time to read the ingredient list. If you’re considering taking these or any other supplements, talk to your health care provider to make sure that they’re safe and effective for your unique health needs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;rare sixth-century sword&lt;/strong&gt; has been uncovered in an Anglo-Saxon burial site near Canterbury, England. This remarkable find offers new insights into early medieval life and could reshape our understanding of Anglo-Saxon society and weaponry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sword, which was found in excellent condition, boasts a &lt;strong&gt;silver-and-gilt hilt &lt;/strong&gt;adorned with &lt;strong&gt;intricate decorative patterns&lt;/strong&gt;, making it an exceptional example of high-status weaponry from the early medieval period. Its blade bears an embossed runic script. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, parts of the sword’s scabbard—crafted from leather and wood and lined with beaver fur—have remarkably survived centuries of wear and decay. Duncan Sayer, the lead archaeologist on the project, emphasized the uniqueness of the sword, stating that it “rivals the swords from Dover and Sutton Hoo.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alice Roberts, professor and presenter of &lt;em&gt;Digging for Britain,&lt;/em&gt; also noted the discovery’s importance, calling it “&lt;strong&gt;an astonishing sword&lt;/strong&gt;” amid an extraordinary Anglo-Saxon cemetery filled with weaponry and &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/11/archaeologists-unearth-1874-message-in-a-bottle-from-a-viking-grave-a-150-year-old-secret-revealed/"&gt;finely furnished graves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Anglo-Saxon Cemetery: An Unprecedented Find&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discovery was made in a previously unexplored Anglo-Saxon cemetery located in Kent, a region rich with historical significance. Archaeologists have so far excavated twelve graves, with estimates suggesting that&lt;strong&gt; around 200 more remain buried at the site&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These graves date back to the fifth and sixth centuries, a period in Anglo-Saxon history that remains largely enigmatic due to the limited written records from the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&lt;strong&gt; cemetery&lt;/strong&gt; has yielded numerous other artifacts, including iron spear-points, &lt;strong&gt;seaxes (Anglo-Saxon knives)&lt;/strong&gt;, and an array of decorative items, all of which offer a wealth of information about the burial practices and material culture of the Anglo-Saxons. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe that the cemetery is the final resting place of individuals who were part of the elite class. The &lt;strong&gt;exact location of the cemetery&lt;/strong&gt; has been kept secret, as excavations are ongoing. Duncan Sayer explained that revealing the site’s location could jeopardize further research and preservation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Sword’s Symbolism: A Royal Connection?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the fascinating features of the sword is the presence of a ring attached to its pommel, which archaeologists believe might symbolize an oath or a bond with a high-status figure, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/3000-year-old-secret-tutankhamun-tomb/" data-type="post" data-id="83600"&gt;possibly a king.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This detail opens a window into the social and political structures of the Anglo-Saxon elite. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The presence of such symbols and the&lt;strong&gt; sword’s high craftsmanship&lt;/strong&gt; suggest that the individual buried with this weapon was a person of considerable importance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Window Into Anglo-Saxon Life&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Historians and archaeologists alike have long struggled with the lack of written records from this period, often referred to as the “&lt;strong&gt;Dark Ages&lt;/strong&gt;.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the ongoing excavation at this site, combined with the sword’s survival. Once fully researched and conserved, the sword will be displayed at the &lt;a href="https://kentdowns.org.uk/activities/folkestone-museum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Folkestone Museum in Kent&lt;/a&gt;, where visitors will have the opportunity to witness a tangible connection to this fascinating period of history.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“ Now it’s absolutely definite that there has to have been a &lt;strong&gt;very significant influx&lt;/strong&gt;, especially in the east coast taking place over generations. They’re not coming from one place, but multiple places. This cemetery is right at the cutting-edge of that work,” explained Sayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

Researchers found that when 15-month-olds heard a new word in a familiar context—like “kumquat” during a conversation about fruit—they later identified the unseen object correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ability to form a mental “gist” of meaning without direct visual cues marks an early milestone in abstract learning and language development. The findings highlight that babies are not just passive listeners—they actively construct knowledge from the language they hear, even about things they can’t see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Word Inference:&lt;/strong&gt; 15-month-old infants can infer meanings of unseen words using context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Representation:&lt;/strong&gt; Infants form a “gist” of new words, even without visual cues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developmental Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; The study reveals how language fuels abstract learning in infancy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human language allows us to learn new words for things we’ve never witnessed directly. We do this seamlessly, for example, in conversations, using clues from the overall context to infer a new word’s meaning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how early does this ability become available? And what makes it possible to create a new mental representation of an object or event that we cannot see directly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109045"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a baby and fruits." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Although they had never seen any object paired with that novel word, 15-month-olds nevertheless used the context clues to identify which object was most likely the one to which the novel word referred. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study by developmental scientists at Northwestern University and Harvard University offers the first evidence that infants as young as 15 months can identify an object they have learned about from listening to language — even if the object remains hidden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine an infant playing with blocks on the floor while listening to parents talk about kumquats in a conversation about more familiar fruits like apples and bananas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Might the infant form an initial representation, or gist, about what kumquat means — something edible, likely a fruit? Can they then use this initial gist later when the infant first sees a novel fruit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the questions the researchers sought to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people believe that success in word learning requires that the infant ‘map’ a new word to an object that is physically present (e.g., “Look at the kumquat!”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But in the natural course of a day, it is very common for us — and for infants — to hear words when the objects to which they refer to are not available to our immediate perception,” said senior author Sandra Waxman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re asking whether infants, too, can use the conversational contexts in which a word occurs to begin to learn their meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waxman is the Louis W. Menk Professor of Psychology, director of the Infant and Child Development Center and an Institute for Policy Research Fellow at Northwestern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s co-author is Elena Luchkina, formerly a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern, and now a research scientist at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers engaged 134 infants, 67 each at 12 months and 15 months in a three-part task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the researchers presented infants with words they understand, paired with an image of the object to which it referred (e.g., apple, banana, grapes). Next, infants heard a new word while the image of a novel object (e.g., a kumquat) was hidden from their view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, two novel objects appeared (e.g., a kumquat and a whisk) and infants were asked, e.g., “where is the kumquat?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen-month-olds, but not 12-month-olds, looked longer at the novel fruit (e.g. kumquat) than the novel artifact (e.g., whisk).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although they had never seen any object paired with that novel word, 15-month-olds nevertheless used the context clues to identify which object was most likely the one to which the novel word referred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study shows that even babies who are just beginning to say their first words learn from the language they hear, even if the objects or events being discussed are not present,” Waxman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Babies take in what they hear, and even if no object is present, they form a mental representation, or ‘gist’ of the new word’s meaning, one that is strong enough for them to use later when its referent object does appear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waxman suggested that at 12 months, infants may not yet know enough of the familiar words they heard in the context to begin to form a representation or gist of the new word’s meaning (e.g., that it is likely another fruit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gleaning the meaning of kumquat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By introducing infants to novel words in the absence of any visible object, the researchers devised a powerful test of how much infants can learn about the meaning of a novel word based on language input alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides new insight for the developmental origins of the human capacity to learn about things that are not perceptually present. It also begins to address how, and how early, the human mind can create mental representations of objects and events never witnessed directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new work also highlights the power of language in infants’ daily lives. In listening to conversations and in book-reading, infants often hear words that they don’t yet understand, and that they cannot ‘map’ immediately to an object or event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this study show that by 15 months, infants spontaneously use the linguistic context in which a new word occurs to build a gist of its meaning that will support subsequent learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we hear new words, like “kumquat” in conversation when there are no kumquats around, we don’t waste the opportunity to home in its meaning,” Waxman said. “We now know this is also true about tiny babies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this language and learning research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c8bbbcadb8a0a9a6a1ade6a3bda4a3ad88a6a7babca0bfadbbbcadbaa6e6adacbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stephanie Kulke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://northwestern.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Stephanie Kulke – Northwestern University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321775" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;By 15 months, infants begin to learn new words for objects, even those they’ve never seen&lt;/a&gt;” by Sandra Waxman et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By 15 months, infants begin to learn new words for objects, even those they’ve never seen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human language permits us to call to mind representations of objects, events, and ideas that we cannot witness directly, enabling us to learn about the world far beyond our immediate surroundings. When and how does this capacity emerge?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this question, we evaluated infants at 12 and 15 months, asking whether they establish a representation of a novel noun’s meaning in the absence of any visible referents, and use this representation to identify a candidate referent when it later becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During training, infants (67 12-month-olds; 67 15-month-olds) were primed with words and images of objects from a particular semantic neighborhood (e.g., fruits) and were also introduced to a novel noun (e.g., “a modi”), used to name a hidden object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During test, infants heard that noun again, this time with two unfamiliar objects present—one from the primed neighborhood (e.g., a dragon fruit) and the other from an unrelated semantic neighborhood (e.g., an ottoman).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If infants can represent something about the meaning of the novel noun in the absence of a visible referent and then use such a representation when a candidate referent appears, then at test, they should prefer the object from the primed semantic neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 15 months, infants succeeded. In contrast, 12-month-olds did not succeed on this task even after a full week of vocabulary training designed to boost the effect of priming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible then that 12-month-olds’ representations of novel nouns’ meaning are not yet sufficiently rich (if any at all) to guide their choice of referent when one does appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings suggest that the capacity to establish a representation of a novel noun’s meaning in the absence of any visible referent and use this representation later to identify a candidate referent object emerges between 12 and 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 18:55:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9iazVLVkRRQ1JlR3JsamZlSE93eTlqellSbm0zVzY4VUxHRzdKR0ZLSHlsSHVYTjdQSFk0bXZGZEo2M2dJOHBMUVVpazA3d0FnS0F0WXhPdmc5OFFya29TWXpYUmZHX29WNE04UFdxMHRHSUZ5bFA0</guid></item><item><title>新型抗生素是30年来首次治疗不断复发的尿路感染-好消息网络 | New Kind of Antibiotic Is First in 30 Years to Treat UTIs That Keep Coming Back - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxOT1UwTWlXNE1GSFJlYmFxbzVKQ2J4b2JQRVVBZDRuOWE5VkNFQXhyc0lpMGNxdWtEU0ZxZnQxaDlEZXlUendDQ3FGcmpRaE5EQ19tNkVQODIwaV82MEtvVURUdG5nYTd4d3d5a2pWQnJDaWNXSXhMVlJhdUVoV3g3LUt2bHZUVGhCYlpSNkNfbWV3b2stQnIwZXdmQXlXRmJmeHBISnR1bVFGdVNRLUZRTGpn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the millions of American women and girls who will get a UTI at some point in the next few years, they may be able to treat it with the first new medication approved for the purpose in 3 decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new class of targeted, oral antibiotic for urinary tract infections is designed to bypass developing antibiotic resistance in UTIs and eliminate recurrence of UTIs in women who experience them frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to CNN, the drug, gepotidacin, will be sold under the brand name Blujepa and is expected to be available in the second half of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blujepa is the first new oral antibiotic to treat UTIs to gain approval in more than 20 years, but it’s been almost 30 since the critical bacteria-fighting function of such a treatment has been redesigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are proud to have developed Blujepa, the first in a new class of oral antibiotics for [uncomplicated UTIs] in nearly three decades, and to bring another option to patients given recurrent infections and rising rates of resistance to existing treatments,” read a statement from GSK, which developed the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gepotidacin works by targeting two enzymes that bacteria need to copy themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half of all women will experience a UTI at some point in their lives. One third of these women will have a UTI that returns multiple times. Women contract these infections at a higher rate than men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UTIs are the cause of roughly 8 million emergency room visits and 100,000 hospitalizations in the US each year, GSK said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was funded in part by grants from the US government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3,000 women and girls took part in the clinical trials which led to the drug’s approval, with the results demonstrating increased efficacy compared to nitrofurantoin, the most commonly-prescribed antibiotic for UTIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side effects including diarrhea and nausea were reported in 16% and 9% of the females respectively, much of which was described as “mild.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many Americans prefer to treat such infections homeopathically, there are times when infections are more aggressive, or when homeopathic options are not available—for example, if one is traveling. In these cases, a more effective backup is a welcomed option.&lt;/p&gt;

These insects infect people with the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, microbes that are complicated to study, difficult to detect when they cause illness, and challenging to treat so they don’t linger in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding that bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, requires basic research before creating diagnostics or vaccines, slow progress that is frustrating for people affected by the chronic fatigue and brain fog of long-term Lyme disease or the joint pain of Lyme arthritis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s just fundamentally different from basically all other disease-causing agents,” Brandon Jutras, an associate professor in microbiology-immunology in the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University, told STAT. He is the senior author of two new research papers published Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In both studies, the scientists used mouse models to explore unique chemical components that persist in the roughly 15% of people who don’t recover from Lyme infections and go on to develop a syndrome similar to other infection-associated illnesses, including long Covid. &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr2955" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; tracked antigens among the bacterial remnants that travel to the liver, and the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr9091" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;other study&lt;/a&gt; screened more than 500 approved antibiotics to find one that may be safer and more effective at a lower dose than standard-of-care doxycycline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, they may offer better recognition and potentially lead to alternative treatment choices for the nearly 1,200 people in the United States who develop Lyme disease every day. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The first paper studied a mouse model of Lyme disease to trace where part of the bacteria’s cell wall travels. As the bacteria grow, they spit out peptidoglycan, a component of the cell wall that acts like a large molecular bag. These remnants can still cause infection if injected into healthy mice. When it accumulates in the liver and persists for weeks, it can be a continuous source of antigens, which the immune system sees and attacks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In previous research, the authors discovered that people with post-infectious Lyme arthritis also had that bacterial peptidoglycan cell wall floating in the synovial fluid of their inflamed joints. And consistent with other facts about this bacteria, their peptidoglycans are chemically different, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We found that the unusual chemical features of the Borrelia burgdorferi peptidoglycan is what makes it able to persist,” Jutras said. “It looks like the liver is acting as a sink for these unusual pieces of peptidoglycan.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And back to those ticks: The scientists can’t say for certain, but they suspect a sugar carried by ticks may penetrate the cell walls shed by the bacteria in ways that trap them in the liver, keeping the immune system on high alert. Those antigens from the discarded cell walls that remain may trigger post-treatment Lyme disease, which has similarities to long Covid and other infection-associated illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The peptidoglycan fragments appeared in the mouse livers even after less severe Lyme illness, but to a lesser degree. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amy Proal, a microbiologist who is chief scientific officer at the nonprofit PolyBio Research Foundation and scientific director of the Cohen Center for Recovery from Complex Chronic Illness at Mount Sinai, told STAT studies need to go beyond the persistent antigens in the peptidoglycan cell walls and to search for the bacteria themselves. She was not involved in Wednesday’s Science Translation Medicine studies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we find persistent antigen in patients with long Covid, we interpret our findings differently than this team. I think that’s a key thing to consider,” she said. “It is helpful, I guess, to know that peptidoglycan can persist a little bit longer than we thought or something. But to be most comprehensive and fully understand what can happen in people who get Borrelia and get chronic symptoms, there’d have to be some work after this to actually look for Borrelia, including in the tissue of the patients who have symptoms after Lyme disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Proal said it’s possible the antigens are being actively produced by bacteria lingering in hidden reservoirs, as is the case with the SARS-CoV-2 virus in long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response, Jutras said purified peptidoglycan, alone, persists in mice, asserting that this work suggests that Lyme can persist without the bacteria still present, because of the peptidoglycan’s unusual features.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Peptidoglycan can be detected in human patients after oral and/or IV antibiotics. We have previously attempted to detect bacterial DNA from B. burgdorferi in the exact same patient samples tested in manuscript and were unable to do so,” he told STAT in an email. “Now, it is possible that Borrelia is still present in these human patients, but at levels that are undetectable even by quantitative PCR. That said, virtually undetectable levels of B. burgdorferi (DNA), if present, cannot explain the considerable concentrations of peptidoglycan we have measured in these samples.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second paper addressed drawbacks in standard antibiotic treatment for Lyme infections. Doxycycline is the go-to medication, but it can’t be given to children under age 8. Because it is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, it harms helpful members of the human microbiome while killing the bacteria that cause Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientists used a sophisticated screening process tied to Borrelia’s properties to yield piperacillin as the best choice, a member of the penicillin family that could be used at a lower dose and with fewer off-target effects. The study’s rationale was that an approved antibiotic might already be out there, just not yet found for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With respect to pipericillin and the antibiotic therapy, we already know that it’s safe in humans, but what we don’t know is whether it works to treat Lyme disease in humans,” Jutras said. “The obvious next step is a human clinical trial, but those are very expensive and they require federal support.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Piperacillin hasn’t drawn much interest from the private sector because it’s a generic antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think the field is making incredible strides in all facets of treatment, diagnosis, and in prevention. It’s desperately needed, given the rapid and continual expansion and increase in the number of cases and geographically speaking, where those cases are occurring,” he said. “So further supporting the research and the field in general, I think, is paramount and something that is very much in question these days.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Swapping my afternoon snack with them instead of a large apple or banana (which have, on average, more carbohydrates) allowed me to maintain more stable blood sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which measures the level of glucose between the layers of my skin. This showed the impact blueberries had on my general blood sugars—mainly, eating around a cup led to fewer spikes, and more even numbers than some higher-carb snacks. As a type 1 diabetic, I do need to administer insulin (I opt for an insulin pump) when I eat anything with carbohydrates (note: carbs, not just sugars).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although I’m not one for &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63592662/ultraprocessed-foods-list/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ultra-processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, I do enjoy some low-cal, low-carb options from time to time.

Pincus notes that blueberries may help improve insulin sensitivity to assist with maintaining healthy blood sugar levels, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7442370/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; back this up too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Blueberry nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2346411/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:United States Department of Agriculture;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;United States Department of Agriculture&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (USDA), 100 grams of blueberries, or 3.5-ounces (around 1/2 cup), contains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Can you eat too many blueberries?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Like just about anything in life, eating too many blueberries may cause some side effects. “Blueberries contain fiber, which most people do not consume enough of; however, too much for someone not used to a high fiber diet could result in gas, bloating, or discomfort,” Pincus notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She says that blueberries contain &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/calcium-oxalate-stones" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:oxalates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;oxalates&lt;/a&gt; (naturally occurring plant compounds that binds minerals), which are not a concern for most people. “However, those with a history of or predisposition for kidney stones may not want to overdo it.” Finally, she points out that though great in moderation, blueberries contain natural sugars, so eating too many may impact blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How to eat more blueberries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Seamlessly add more to your routine by making one of these delicious, healthy recipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; Eating blueberries every day left me with more stable blood sugars after consuming them, but that’s pretty much the main benefit I saw in my brief experiment. I do continue to eat them weekly, and have done so for years, so perhaps it’s been a gradual change that is too incremental for me to notice. Regardless, blueberries are one of my favorite foods, and I’ll continue to enjoy them as a part of a nutritious eating plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 18:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQTU9Ibk5McXBmMk1CVDBodk4wSUUwdlZaNkFWWHBkclhDOF9scWNWSWxmQWNrLUFzejJCa1VQU3N2RDg5cjBJbmREcUhhRllLbi02LV9BN1FmTFFybC1FeTMyVGRlRVlRVG5tSXBOeHBHRUh6eWk0TFhGRXFNUVVtcmp1dlBFVTFt</guid></item><item><title>佐治亚州第二只确认患有慢性消瘦病的鹿- AccessWDUN | Second deer in Georgia confirmed to have Chronic Wasting Disease - AccessWDUN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxOZkVXdm9kRGh3MzF5SjU3Q0hTY0o5b1p2a3JiazF1X2hzY2lWUmFVRERsaDVsN3U4dHJUQUlGaG9oRElvRV84Yk5RNGZDTHItSlQ1UUdaaGtZNVU5R0UzTXhNQXNJakdzS3NJT1ZlN1VJV2FVa3dGYV9yUlJma2RiYzN1U3pfcnJyVFc1cHFsRWkxbXk2RG5GUXQ1aFpZU04xSk5aX3NuYXgzWE1jdm1V?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second case of Chronic Wasting Disease was detected in a deer in Social Circle, Ga. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Georgia Department of Natural Resources Wildlife Division said Wednesday that the four-year-old male deer was taken in Berrien County approximately 400 yards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://accesswdun.com/article/2025/1/1282712/chronic-wasting-disease-spotted-in-deer-in-georgia-for-first-time"&gt; from the first CWD-positive deer harvest location&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. The first case was confirmed in January from a deer found on a property near the Berrien-Lanier county line in South Georgia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CWD is a neurological disease that is caused by misfolded proteins called prions, according to the DNR. Currently there is no treatment or preventative vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our staff continues to work in collaboration with landowners and hunters in the CWD Management Area to sample for the disease. These collaborative efforts will help us manage CWD and ensure Georgia maintains healthy deer herds,”  DNR Commissioner Walter Rabon said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no known transmission of CWD to humans. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hunters harvesting a deer, elk, or moose from an area where CWD is known to be present have their animal tested for CWD prior to consuming the meat and do not consume the meat if the animal tests positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Mice trained to associate visual cues with cold temperatures began to increase their metabolism when shown those cues—even at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This response was linked to specific memory-encoding neurons, or “engrams,” in the hippocampus that drive thermogenesis via brown fat activation. The findings could have major implications for treating disorders like obesity and cancer, where metabolism and thermoregulation play key roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold Memories Exist:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice formed lasting memories of cold that altered their metabolism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engrams Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Activating or silencing cold-specific hippocampal engrams changed metabolic responses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Insights into cold memory could inform treatments for obesity and cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;TCD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New multidisciplinary research led by Prof. Tomás Ryan from Trinity College Dublin shows that the brain forms memories of cold experiences and uses them to control our metabolism. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This newly published study is the first to show that cold memories form in the brain, and map out how they subsequently drive thermoregulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109037"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman in the snow." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;But to identity these engrams they first had to test whether cold memories could form in the first place. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery may have important applications in therapies designed to treat a range of disorders – from obesity to cancer – in which thermoregulation and metabolism (or a lack of control in this area) plays a role, as well as opening the door to more fundamental research, which could help us better understand how memories impact our behaviour and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1897, the physiologist Ivan Pavlov first described classical conditioning, where animals and humans form associations between different aspects of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He showed that dogs could be trained to salivate in hopeful anticipation of food, when an associated bell was rung. Classical or Pavlovian conditioning has since become a core staple of neuroscience and psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term memories are stored in the brain as ensembles of inter-connected cells, termed engrams. Increasingly, modern neuroscience is beginning to identify engrams that encode for bodily representations, such as experiences of infection; inflammation; food consumption; and pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind this work hypothesised that the brain may form engrams for temperature representations, and that these would serve to help an organism survive in changing temperatures. But to identity these engrams they first had to test whether cold memories could form in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While memories are generally measured as changes in animal behaviour, the Ryan Lab collaborated with Prof. Lydia Lynch (then at Trinity College Dublin, now at Princeton University).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They focused on metabolism as a first-order readout of cold experience, because mammals are known to increase their metabolism to create heat in the body when the environment is cold, via a process of adaptive thermogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lead author of the article published today in the leading international journal, &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, Dr Andrea Muñoz Zamora, successfully trained mice to associate a cold experience of 4 °C with novel visual cues that were only present in designated cold contexts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After a few days, mice were presented with the visual cues in the same context, but at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the team discovered that the animals would upregulate their metabolism to induce predictive thermogenesis when they were “expecting” the environment to be cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having established that mice could form memories of cold experiences, the team then delved into how this was happening in the brain. Using activity-dependent gene labelling, the scientists were able to genetically hitchhike onto the engram cells coding for the cold memory in a brain region known as the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, when these cold engram cells were artificially stimulated (using a technique called optogenetics), the mice increased their metabolism in order to generate heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in a converse experiment, to double-check the central finding, when cold engram cells were inhibited the mice were unable to express cold memories in response to the conditioned visual cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Muñoz Zamora&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; said: “We discovered that when mice are exposed to a cold temperature they form memories that allow them to up-regulate their body’s metabolism when they anticipate cold experiences in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Lynch added: “A large part of this learned control of body temperature seems to be due to increased activity of brown adipose tissue – or brown fat – which can be controlled by innervations originating in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our brain must learn from the bodily experiences of cold, but then feeds back to control how our fat cells respond to cold.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Aaron Douglas, who was joint lead author on the study, said: “Numerous clinical disorders, ranging from obesity to forms of cancer, may be treated by manipulating thermoregulation through brown adipose tissue. In the future, it will be important to test whether the manipulation of cold memories in humans could provide novel avenues for altering metabolism for therapeutic purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research opens many new doors for further discovery research, as well as the development of treatments. Understanding how representations of cold experiences affect broader brain functions such as emotion, decision-making, and social behaviour will provide insights into the embodied nature of the mind, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sophisticated aspects of our minds evolved from more basic, visceral, bodily representations,” said Prof. Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how these components of our brain affect our behaviour in general is crucial to understanding our emotions and our use of memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This integrative piece of work offers a quintessential example of inter-disciplinary science. Neuroscience requires collaboration and it was the synergy with Prof. Lynch that allowed the unusual combination of memory engram work with metabolism research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory and metabolism research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b6d2d3d7d8d3c2def6c2d5d298dfd3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Thomas Deane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tcd.ie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TCD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Thomas Deane – TCD&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08902-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cold memories control whole-body thermoregulatory responses&lt;/a&gt;” by Lydia Lynch et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold memories control whole-body thermoregulatory responses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental thermal challenges trigger the brain to coordinate both autonomic and behavioural responses to maintain optimal body temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unknown how temperature information is precisely stored and retrieved in the brain and how it is converted into a physiological response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we investigated whether memories could control whole-body metabolism by training mice to remember a thermal challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were conditioned to associate a context with a specific temperature by combining thermoregulatory Pavlovian conditioning with engram-labelling technology, optogenetics and chemogenetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report that if mice are returned to an environment in which they previously experienced a 4 °C cold challenge, they increase their metabolic rates regardless of the actual environmental temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we show that mice have increased hypothalamic activity when they are exposed to the cold, and that a specific network emerges between the hippocampus and the hypothalamus during the recall of a cold memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both natural retrieval and artificial reactivation of cold-sensitive memory engrams in the hippocampus mimic the physiological responses that are seen during a cold challenge. These ensembles are necessary for cold-memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings show that retrieval of a cold memory causes whole-body autonomic and behavioural responses that enable mice to maintain thermal homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 17:45:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE4wdDZqU2g5S1c4Nk5LQ1VEc2JkRGJqT2RWMVFvM01MdWN0TGJjZllFcVlMd2ppVXJHZlp1M1dleHVieXFIZlM3Q0ZDcnJvVzJNYTMtU1IzV1R3bVI1cGpaSG1fdUdWU2FPUmJ0U2ZuN0dhWGxpMFE</guid></item><item><title>这种饮料可以对抗衰老，促进减肥，并提高能量， doc说： “这是我一直在寻找的神奇子弹” -纽约邮报 | This drink can fight aging, promote weight loss, and boost energy, says doc: ‘It’s the magic bullet I was looking for’ - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPbjg3QlNvSWZ6ZWxwSmNLbE5QYmpvc1FXNzk0YkNoR2N6UXp1bmwyZXRNcTlVYzA5dUpLaEJ6NVpJX2dzMUVYa05BU2JLaUc5YkV4UzBYeDlWQURVWHhsQjQ1cWozUlVmWWp0VzZjdzBpQVFYN0UwRjdXbkZuMW9SaVpVNTl6bC1kQTJYY1JHSXdQQ3Z0em1fSG9seER2bnM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;Proper hydration is crucial — but what if your glass of water could do more than quench your thirst?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a turbocharged drink gaining popularity in the US that proponents say can boost your energy, fight signs of aging and even ward off signs of disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is going to change the world,” &lt;a href="https://www.perriconemd.com/?affil=awin&amp;amp;utm_content=Skimlinks&amp;amp;utm_term=Sub+Networks&amp;amp;utm_source=AWin_78888&amp;amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=AffiliateWin&amp;amp;sv_campaign_id=78888&amp;amp;sv_tax1=affiliate&amp;amp;sv_tax2=&amp;amp;sv_tax3=Skimlinks&amp;amp;sv_tax4=nypost.com&amp;amp;sv_affiliate_id=78888&amp;amp;awc=21122_1745425645_74398e18cd85fc36a8be2ba7660ec167" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Nicholas Perricone&lt;/a&gt;, a renowned nutritionist and dermatologist, told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Perricone’s second book “The Beauty Molecule” was released April 15. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images for the New You Awards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his new book, “&lt;a href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBeauty-Molecule-Introducing-Neuroceuticals-Breakthrough%2Fdp%2F1250286794%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F04%2F15%2Fhealth%2Fboost-production-of-the-beauty-molecule-with-this-diet%2F%26asc_source%3Dwww.google.com%26ascsubtag%3Dsrctok-a9337dbc51f28ec9%26btn_ref%3Dsrctok-a9337dbc51f28ec9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Beauty Molecule: Introducing Neuroceuticals, the Breakthrough for Ageless Beauty&lt;/a&gt;,” Perricone breaks down the science behind the beverage and shares insider tips to maximize every sip.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Looking East for the “magic bullet”&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, Perricone set out on a mission to find what he called the “magic bullet” — an anti-inflammatory that’s nontoxic, affordable, easy to use and widely accessible.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;In Asia, inhaling hydrogen gas for better health and vitality had long been a common practice. But when research out of Japan showed that drinking hydrogen-infused water can boost energy, Perricone’s curiosity was piqued — though he remained skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hydrogen is a nonpolar molecule. It’s not going to interact with the body,” Perricone remembers thinking at the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To get to the bottom of it, Perricone traveled to Tokyo to meet with scientists studying hydrogen. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They explained that, when applied to living cells, hydrogen has a potent antioxidant and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/01/health/blueberries-walnuts-dark-chocolate-reduce-joint-inflammation-doctor/"&gt;anti-inflammatory &lt;/a&gt;effect. It also boosts cellular energy while targeting and neutralizing dangerous free radicals in the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Perricone recommends drinking two cans of hydrogen water per day.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;izzetugutmen – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The toxic hydroxyl radical causes significant damage to cell structures and contributes to their functional decline; in other words, aging,” Perricone wrote in his new book.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back in the US, Perricone, with the help of colleague Dr. Peter Pugliese, began testing the effects of hydrogen water on energy. Their focus was on &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/03/lifestyle/nad-supplement-craze-sweeps-hollywood-but-does-it-work/"&gt;NAD+&lt;/a&gt; and NADH, two forms of the same molecule that plays a key role in cellular energy as well as the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It’s the one of the only molecules in the skin that fluoresces, meaning it emits light or radiation when exposed to certain conditions, such as an LED light.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test whether hydrogen water could boost NADH, Perricone and his team conducted a study in which half the participants drank hydrogen water and the other half had a placebo. Afterward, they were placed under an LED light to track changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perricone expected it to take hours to see any results, but within just two minutes, the first participants’ NADH levels spiked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I sure as hell knew it wasn’t just water,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By the end of the study, participants had a 12.5% average increase in NADH, with the elevated levels lasting for hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This study proved to me that hydrogen can and does increase cellular energy,” Perricone wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can get this country drinking hydrogen water on a regular basis, we could lower our health care costs by a third.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dr. Nicholas Perricone&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A multimillion-dollar bet&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past eight years, Perricone has poured millions into developing his own hydrogen water — using the same technology and methods already popular in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s the magic bullet I was looking for,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not only is hydrogen water simple, inexpensive and nontoxic, but Perricone said it can help normalize metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As we age, one of the biggest killers is the loss of metabolic control, which is seen in an increase in blood sugar, despite an increase in insulin,” Perricone wrote. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hydrogen has been shown to help normalize metabolism.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;olga – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This condition, called &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/30/health/metabolic-syndrome-patients-may-benefit-from-intermittent-fasting-study/"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, causes &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/14/health/this-105-calorie-snack-can-help-lower-your-blood-pressure/"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, elevated blood sugar levels, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/27/health/study-reveals-surprising-brain-boosting-benefit-of-belly-fat/"&gt;belly fat&lt;/a&gt; and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels. It’s linked to a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/20/health/exercising-during-this-3-hour-window-lowers-heart-disease-risk/"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/25/health/avoiding-bright-light-at-night-may-prevent-type-2-diabetes-study/"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/26/health/strokes-may-be-more-devastating-to-smart-people-heres-how/"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/17/health/study-digital-tech-use-lowers-risk-of-brain-decline-by-42/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Perricone believes that hydrogen water could be key in reversing the rise of metabolic syndrome across the country. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He pointed to a study by &lt;a href="https://molecularhydrogeninstitute.org/tyler-lebaron-phd/"&gt;Dr. Tyler LeBaron&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the Molecular Hydrogen Institute, which followed 60 people in India diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Half drank hydrogen water, while the other half drank plain water — with no changes to diet or exercise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After 24 weeks, the results were staggering. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One hundred percent of those drinking hydrogen water no longer had metabolic syndrome, and they also lost an average of seven pounds,” Perricone said, noting that the placebo group showed no improvements. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we can get this country drinking hydrogen water on a regular basis, we could lower our health care costs by a third,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his book, Perricone lists several other benefits associated with hydrogen water, including reducing skin aging, boosting gut health, enhancing nutrient absorption, removing toxins, speeding recovery from workouts and improving muscle tone and joint mobility. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He even says it can combat the toxic effects of alcohol, alleviating &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/health/dietitian-reveals-4-best-foods-for-hangovers-and-4-to-avoid/"&gt;hangovers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/16/health/how-to-sleep-better-while-traveling-from-jet-lag-hacks-to-amenities/"&gt;fight jet lag&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Maximizing the benefits of hydrogen water &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several brans sell hydrogen water, while Perricone has &lt;a href="https://perriconehydrogenwater.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;launched his own line&lt;/a&gt;, priced at $69.00 for a 24-pack of 12 oz cans. It’s proven a quick hit and has already sold out — though they promise to restock soon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Perricone has spent eight years developing his own brand of hydrogen water.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Perricone Hydrogen Water Company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But before you crack open a cold can, there are a few things you should know.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You have to drink it out of the can; you can’t pour it into a glass or sip it through a straw because you’ll lose the hydrogen,” Perricone said. “You also have to drink it within 10 minutes of opening.” &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Perricone recommends drinking hydrogen water twice a day, the same as the participants in the metabolic syndrome study. But he drinks more himself — typically three to four cans per day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It gets rid of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/31/surprising-ways-you-can-blitz-brain-fog-and-sharpen-your-mind/"&gt;brain fog&lt;/a&gt; in the morning very quickly,” he said. “I like to have it midday before a workout and toward the end of the day because I often have a lot of work to do and want to have a nice clear brain.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perricone also believes hydrogen water can be especially helpful for people who play sports, particularly children and teens. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If there’s a quick movement of the head, like in soccer, for example, micro-inflammation is created every time they work out,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I would love to see everybody who works out like this or plays sports to have a can of hydrogen water before or after to stop this low-grade inflammation, because it’s cumulative and can damage the body over time. We want this to start in kindergarten.” &lt;/p&gt;

In a new study, individuals with symptomatic carotid plaque had plastic levels up to 51 times higher than those without plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the presence of plastic didn’t correlate with sudden inflammation, it did alter gene activity in immune cells involved in stabilizing arterial plaque. These findings raise concern about the long-term impact of plastic exposure on cardiovascular health and stroke risk, though more research is needed to determine causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plastic in Plaque:&lt;/strong&gt; Carotid artery plaque in stroke patients contained 51× more micronanoplastics than in healthy arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; High plastic levels changed immune gene activity in plaque-stabilizing cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Plastic buildup in arteries could become a novel risk factor for stroke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AHA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with plaque in the blood vessels of their neck have a higher amount of tiny plastic particles in those vessels compared to people with healthy arteries. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increase was significantly higher in people who had experienced a stroke, mini-stroke or temporary loss of vision due to clogged blood vessels, according to preliminary research presented at the American Heart Association’s Vascular Discovery 2025 Scientific Sessions: From Genes to Medicine, April 22–25 in Baltimore&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109033"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Researchers say there is currently no effective way to prevent exposure to micronanoplastics. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micronanoplastics are tiny pieces of plastic created in industrial processes or from larger plastic objects as they degrade in the ocean or the soil. Micronanoplastics are not uniform in size and are a mixture of micro and nano plastic sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While microplastics are sometimes visible at less than 5 millimeters in size (5 millimeters is the size of a pencil’s eraser), nanoplastics are microscopic (invisible to the naked eye), less than 1,000 nanometers across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes them more easily dispersed and able to penetrate cells and tissues in living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers suggest that terminology should gradually transition to nanoplastics because that is more precisely what is being studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These types of plastics are commonly found in the environment, especially in ocean garbage patches. Over many years, these plastics break down, mix into the soil and water, and can build up in the food chain,” said lead study author Ross Clark, M.D., M.B.A., R.P.V.I., a vascular surgeon-scientist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people think that micro and nanoplastics mainly come from using plastic utensils, cutting boards, packaging, water bottles and other plastic items. However, the main source is the food and water we eat and drink.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, researchers in Italy reported finding micronanoplastics in plaque from some people without symptoms who underwent surgery to remove carotid artery plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms caused by carotid plaque buildup may include stroke, mini-stroke or temporary blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Followed for almost three years after surgery, people with micronanoplastics in their carotid plaque were significantly more likely to die or to have a non-fatal heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study, which included fewer than 50 participants, was built on the previous research conducted in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers compared the levels of micronanoplastics found in the carotid arteries of three groups: people with healthy arteries; those with plaque but no symptoms; and those experiencing symptoms due to plaque buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also compared plaques with low and high plastic levels to assess the effects of micronanoplastics on markers of inflammation, the gene activity of immune cells called macrophages and stem cells that help stabilize plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis found that the concentration of micronanoplastics in carotid arteries was:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;16 times higher (895 micrograms/gram vs. 57 micrograms/gram) in plaque among people without symptoms compared to the levels found in artery walls of deceased tissue donors of similar age with no plaque; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;51 times higher (2,888 micrograms/gram vs. 57 micrograms/gram) in plaque from people who had experienced stroke, mini-stroke or temporary loss of vision due to blockage of blood flow to the retina, in comparison to samples from age-matched, deceased tissue donors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing high-plastic and low-plastic plaque levels, the analysis found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;no link between the amount of micronanoplastics and signs of sudden inflammation; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;differences in gene activity in plaque-stabilizing cells and less activity in anti-inflammatory genes of plaque macrophage immune cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings indicate that the biological effects of micronanoplastics on fatty deposits are more complex and nuanced than simply causing sudden inflammation,” Clark said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their next phase of work, they will focus on better understanding the immunological effects of micronanoplastics in clogged arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very important to study what these materials do to our bodies. However, we should be cautious about the early results of this study. We won’t fully understand the biological effects for many years to come,” Clark said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has several limitations. It cannot prove that micronanoplastics in plaque were the cause of symptoms of carotid artery disease; micronanoplastics might be a sign of another health issue that caused these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers did not have access to data detailing the sex or race/ethnicity of the tissue donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, used to measure plastic in biological samples may have limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technique allows measurements to include nanoplastics and larger microplastic particles and uses high temperatures to break down plastics into smaller organic molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, parts of the biological samples may also break down into similar molecules. For instance, fatty acids found in artery-clogging plaque could break down into compounds appearing similar to polyethylene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are constantly improving our method to reduce the amounts of lipids in the samples to lessen their impact on the results. Lipids have a very similar spectral signature on gas chromatography as some plastic polymers (in particular polyethylene).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can be challenging to distinguish between the lipids and the polyethylene in the results. That’s why removing the lipids is so important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe our methods are currently the best way to address this specific criticism. However, new discoveries might change how we understand this data in the future,” Clark said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a very interesting and troubling study. To date, we have not considered exposure to plastic micronanoparticles a modifiable risk factor for stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although it is important to understand the mechanism at play in the pathophysiology of symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis, this association presents a novel potential target for stroke prevention,” said Karen L. Furie, M.D., M.P.H., FAHA, volunteer vice chair of the American Heart Association Stroke Brain Health Science Subcommittee and professor and chair of neurology at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Furie was not involved in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study details, background and design:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers tested 48 samples of carotid arteries from 48 different adults collected in 2023-2024 at the University of New Mexico and the Office of the Medical Investigator (a state agency and part of the Department of Pathology at the University of New Mexico).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About one-third of the samples were from people aged 60 to 90 who had surgery to remove plaque from their carotid arteries. These people had symptoms including stroke, mini-stroke or temporary blindness (called amaurosis fugax).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About one-third of the samples came from people of similar age with no symptoms. They were having surgery to remove plaque buildup in their carotid arteries because a blockage was found during screening or a physical exam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The last one-third of the samples came from tissue donors. These age-matched donors had died of any cause and did not have carotid artery blockage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The researchers also compared plaques with low vs. high amounts of micronanoplastics on inflammation-related measures. All samples were analyzed to measure inflammation by looking at levels of inflammatory molecules TNF-α and IL-6. The levels were compared to the amount of plastics to find any connections. For the RNA sequencing studies, researchers examined samples with the highest and lowest concentrations of plastics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#deb5bfacbbb0f0bfadaab2bb9eb6bbbfacaaf0b1acb9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Karen Astle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://heart.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AHA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Karen Astle – AHA&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image:&lt;/strong&gt;

found people who eat more than about 19 bites (or four servings) of chicken per week are more likely to die than those who eat less than 100 grams weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the study appears to have found a concerning link between eating too much chicken - generally considered healthier than red meat because it's lower in saturated fat and cholesterol - and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14512125/sign-stage-four-bowel-cancer-diagnosis-dont-ignore-it.html"&gt;gastrointestinal cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings suggest those eating more than 300 grams weekly had double the risk of an early death from digestive system cancers - the risk was even higher for men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear why consuming just 19 bites of chicken may increase &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-47843ec0-205a-11f0-b59f-e3686b99f796"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study suggests eating just 19 bites of chicken per week could increase your risk of dying by nearly 30 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To investigate a potential link between chicken and early death, researchers from the National Institute of Gastroenterology in Italy collected data on the diets of 4,869 adults, then tracked their health for 19 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each participant provided information about their demographic background, general health status, lifestyle habits and medical history through interviews with the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also recorded their weight, height and blood pressure, and asked them to complete a research-backed questionnaire about their eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The survey included questions about how much red meat, poultry and total meat the participants ate, and this data was sorted into four intake levels per protein type. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the course of the observation period, the researchers kept track of who died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the 1,028 participants who died, white meat accounted for roughly 41 percent of their weekly meat intake, and 29 percent of that was poultry. The remaining 59 percent was red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used statistical analysis to look for a link between poultry consumption and mortality, eliminating the role of other factors such as age, sex and health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/8/1370"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, suggested eating more than 300 grams of chicken per week was associated with a 27 percent increased mortality risk from any cause compared to eating less than 100 grams per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Research by &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://thinkbeef.ca/beef-and-fat/"&gt;Health Canada&lt;/a&gt; shows the different fat concentrations in chicken versus beef, suggesting that chicken may not always be the leaner choice after all &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The findings suggest that those eating more than 300 grams weekly had more than double the risk of early death from digestive system cancers — and for men, the risk was even higher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What's more, the researchers found the risk increased as the portion consumed increased, and was higher compared to eating the same portion of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it doesn't appear to affect everyone the same way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'Our results showed that men have a higher risk than women of dying from [gastrointestinal cancer] for the same proportion of poultry consumed,' the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, men who consumed more than 300 grams of poultry per week were 2.6 times more likely to die from digestive cancer than those who ate less than 100 grams. For the general study population, the risk was only 2.27 times greater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers aren't sure why men are at higher risk, as there is 'no known biological mechanism to explain the observed sex differences,' they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study's findings suggest men who eat more than 300 grams of chicken per week are more likely to die early than woman who eat the same amount &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But differences in sex hormones may play a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study points to previous research in mice that suggests estrogen, a hormone closely associated with female reproductive systems, may influence the ability to metabolize nutrients as well as the risk of developing certain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers note, however, that 'further investigation is needed to support this hypothesis,' and that general dietary differences between men and woman could also play a role, as they suggest women tend to prefer smaller portions and healthier foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the study's alarming findings, there was some evidence to support the idea that poultry is generally healthier than red meat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Higher consumption of red meat was observed among participants who died from non-digestive cancers. Red meat made up 64 percent of weekly meat intake for those that died of these diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study authors noted the research had several limitations, including that the questionnaire used did not ask about different cuts of meat, processed poultry consumption or how the poultry was prepared, which may influence health outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also did not collect data on participants' exercise habits, which plays a critical role in overall health and prevention of early death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also important to note observational studies like this one cannot establish a direct relationship - these findings only point to a possible link between poultry consumption and early death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, the study adds more data to a conflicting body of research on this topic. While some previous studies have identified a similar link, others have found the opposite or no link at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Red meat, however, has been linked to many poor health outcomes, including heart disease, cancer and Type 2 diabetes - thus, chicken has long been touted as the healthier meat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this study raises new questions about that claim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More research is needed to determine exactly how eating poultry affects health - it's an important question as chicken consumption continues to rise in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 16:27:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNOVRCTWJTbTlKa1RreDZfcXlQTHhiYkhqbWZUdTN2djc5Y0M5UGlRWnVwd0VtMGQxSTJyODdhUmRqeEJwc0hubGljMXo1UWVrTkd1NEhKUmswSXRMdjd0dkdjZlJHa1lBVGtNa3F6dXJheEwyeVV5WXdPcmlmcURLTERuQlRGazVZOFZ6Y0ZHaEZEOXUwOUdJOFpqTWZncUFaN3lyVW5LS3N2UGtwWHFweDFCVGN4NVNJLS1HdkFFM3ZRVUhGZmVQNw</guid></item><item><title>研究发现常见的安眠药可以帮助预防阿尔茨海默病- WKRC | Study finds common sleeping pill could help prevent Alzheimer's disease - WKRC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3gJBVV95cUxQd3cyQXUzWDY3UmtSX0hjWTN3dkxKRGs4Sk9VQ3NUMnh1Zk5NYmcyeWRORW9yOWFvNWdTYjZuZUtXSUFwSlpHR3RtU3dHR1hJRkoybk1zbE9RYURzcm5jeWhxOGpxM0xiMTIzbjZRT05yaDhfelc0MFhzejFER3pvLTBxOHF1NUNhV3NSdDNjSDc3SmhzY2RVTlp4RWozcHdQb2JnNENqMlBEVE1IREF4WW1tLXBIR3NMaEVqMy1qQnhGZEVtdnBQQzJISnN4MGJkTTVlY2N2ZnhZTFdxQTVYSzBaSUFtSHJEVFJTY242cUVNUU5weDBOVkYydHBZdGtoU3FiQkQyNkc1SzZPNmN6dUFuRWhKODlDTE1JM3c1amdrUm5sRkdTeUtrblJqVkl4QkladmpOT0txUEg0Wk1GRktFZUtneEl5Q1ZYeVZDS25ybUJyMmxWeXRZaWRyUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_storyColumn__EZ7G" id="js-Story-Content-0"&gt;&lt;p class="StoryTags-module_tagWrapperLine__Jfav"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI (WKRC) - A commonly prescribed sleeping pill could be a powerful tool in preventing Alzheimer's disease, according to recently published research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26641" target="_blank" title="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26641" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt;, published in&lt;em&gt; Annals of Neurology&lt;/em&gt;, was born from the long-standing scientific belief that poor sleep increases a person's risk of Alzheimer's. This belief came from the fact that sleep clears out wasteful proteins like amyloid-beta and tau, which Alzheimer's patients often have a high build up of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examined suvorexant, a sleeping pill regularly prescribed for insomnia, and observed its effects on clearing those waste proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers enlisted 38 middle-aged adults and split them into two groups, one with the sleeping pill and one with a placebo. The authors observed a 10 to 20 percent decrease in the waste proteins in those who took the sleeping pill over those who didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the results certainly indicate that the medicine could in some way prevent Alzheimer's, the researchers noted that the results were very short-lived and that regularly taking the medication came with a slew of other side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the build up of waste proteins is just one theory about the source of Alzheimer's with many scientists in the medical field still disagreeing about its root cause. Nonetheless, many neurologists still believe that a lack of restful sleep is a key factor in developing Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 16:07:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3gJBVV95cUxQd3cyQXUzWDY3UmtSX0hjWTN3dkxKRGs4Sk9VQ3NUMnh1Zk5NYmcyeWRORW9yOWFvNWdTYjZuZUtXSUFwSlpHR3RtU3dHR1hJRkoybk1zbE9RYURzcm5jeWhxOGpxM0xiMTIzbjZRT05yaDhfelc0MFhzejFER3pvLTBxOHF1NUNhV3NSdDNjSDc3SmhzY2RVTlp4RWozcHdQb2JnNENqMlBEVE1IREF4WW1tLXBIR3NMaEVqMy1qQnhGZEVtdnBQQzJISnN4MGJkTTVlY2N2ZnhZTFdxQTVYSzBaSUFtSHJEVFJTY242cUVNUU5weDBOVkYydHBZdGtoU3FiQkQyNkc1SzZPNmN6dUFuRWhKODlDTE1JM3c1amdrUm5sRkdTeUtrblJqVkl4QkladmpOT0txUEg0Wk1GRktFZUtneEl5Q1ZYeVZDS25ybUJyMmxWeXRZaWRyUQ</guid></item><item><title>迷幻药可能重置大脑免疫链接，驱动恐惧和焦虑-神经科学新闻 | Psychedelics May Reset Brain-Immune Link Driving Fear and Anxiety - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTFBKUXFFb2tzYlNoX2FPT2FUa19TeEVLRFRkN0NhdlFfZlRvSGtFcVE0WDJOT3p1aU1RaFd1eVN1N1ZhRkhUQjNDdFkwSW1tZzh4SFRzNFBzTmhhZGdYZFRMRnFjNDNsa0Q0RGZFeTRCd3ZDazJ4bzN4ZVlTN1lSZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that chronic stress activates immune cells that travel to the brain, amplify inflammation, and heighten fear responses. Researchers found that psychedelics like MDMA and psilocybin disrupt this immune-brain crosstalk, reducing stress-related fear in mice and showing similar effects in human tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest psychedelics may help reset dysfunctional neuroimmune pathways involved in depression, anxiety, and inflammatory diseases. While not a cure-all, this research opens new therapeutic possibilities for targeting the root of emotional and immune dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear-Inflammation Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Stress triggers immune cells to migrate to the brain and activate fear pathways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychedelic Protection:&lt;/strong&gt; MDMA and psilocybin blocked immune-driven fear responses in preclinical models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Similar immune-brain signaling was found in human tissues and depression datasets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Brigham and Women’s Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass General Brigham researchers found that interactions between immune and brain cells drive fear responses, but treatment with psychedelics like MDMA and psilocybin may reverse these effects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that fear and the immune system are connected in previously unknown ways. Researchers at Mass General Brigham found that the immune system can influence stress and fear behaviors by changing how brain cells communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109025"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Prior research has shown immune signaling can drive the development of neuropsychiatric diseases such as major depressive disorder (MDD). Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators further showed that psychedelic treatments could target these neuroimmune interactions and reduce stress-induced fear in preclinical models and found similar results in human tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results are published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study underscores how psychedelics can do more than just change perception; they can help dial down inflammation and reset brain-immune interactions,” said corresponding author Michael Wheeler, PhD, of the Gene Lay Institute of Immunology and Inflammation as well as the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could reshape how we think about treatment for inflammatory disorders and conditions like anxiety and depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research has shown immune signaling can drive the development of neuropsychiatric diseases such as major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the ways that specific immune mechanisms can also affect behaviors due to chronic stress or MDD remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a mouse model of chronic stress, the researchers determined that increased crosstalk between cells in the amygdala, or the brain’s fear center, boosted fear behaviors, elevated inflammatory signaling, and activated fear-promoting amygdala neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, inflammatory immune cells called monocytes migrated from other parts of the body to the brain meninges during chronic stress. The research team demonstrated that artificially manipulating these cells impacted fear behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating stressed mice with psilocybin and MDMA prevented monocytes from accumulating in the brain and lowered fear behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators found similar signals of response to stress in human brain cells and in gene expression datasets from patients with MDD, suggesting that the same interactions between the immune system and the brain may play a role in neuropsychiatric disorders in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that further experiments are needed to understand exactly how psychedelics affect immune cells and brain communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next steps include examining the long-term effects of psychedelic treatment on patients with MDD or inflammatory diseases. Wheeler is currently collaborating with investigators from the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for the Neuroscience of Psychedelics on a clinical trial of patients with depression who are being treated with psychedelics and will examine their tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not saying that psychedelics are a cure-all for inflammatory diseases or any other health condition,” said Wheeler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But we do see evidence that psychedelics have some tissue-specific benefits and that learning more about them could open up entirely new possibilities for treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorship: &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to Wheeler, Mass General Brigham authors include Elizabeth N.

    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;ALSTEAD, N.H. — Brayden Ring’s family and friends say they’ll remember many endearing details about the 21-year-old who died suddenly last month — even down to his sock collection.&lt;/p&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;“He loved to wear socks and slides, and the socks were obnoxious and outrageous (and) the weirder the sock the better,” said Donalin Rock, Brayden’s mother. At Brayden’s 8th-grade graduation from Vilas Middle School, his principal even mentioned his socks, Rock recalled. Some had monkeys and bananas on them. Others had burgers and french fries.&lt;/p&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;“He liked to make fun of himself and he just laughed and just wore what he liked.” &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
      
	

   
     
   

     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;Born in Keene, N.H., and raised in Alstead, N.H., Ring was known for being a carefree and affable soccer goalie who liked listening to the Red Hot Chili Peppers and watching Star Wars. Ring died from pneumonia after getting the flu on March 6.&lt;/p&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;The speed at which his health declined came as a shock to Brayden’s family. In addition to playing hockey and soccer — both of which he competed in at Fall Mountain Regional High School — Rock said her son didn’t smoke or drink alcohol, and had no underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;Ring died during the strongest flu season in the United States since the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.&lt;/p&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;“Influenza varies from season to season for a variety of reasons, some of which we still don’t understand,” said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. This flu season, Schaffner said, hospitalizations were high, as the respiratory virus was “in every part of the country on the severe end of the spectrum.” &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
      
	

   
     
   

     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;While most flu deaths occur among older adults and people with underlying health issues, cases like Brayden’s can happen, according to Schaffner. Hospitalized flu patients, Schaffner said, “can otherwise be completely healthy. This is a testimony to the severity of this virus.” &lt;/p&gt;

    
     

     
       





      






    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;The CDC reports 580,000 hospitalizations from flu-related illnesses in the 2024-25 season, up from 470,000 flu-related hospitalizations in 2023-24. The CDC measures flu activity weekly, but considers the peak of flu season between December and February.&lt;/p&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;Seventy-one Granite Staters died of influenza-related illnesses during the 2024-25 flu season, the highest number of deaths since the state started tracking flu deaths 30 years ago, according to the N.H. Department of Health and Human Services. Hospitals throughout New Hampshire were frequently at or near capacity during the 2024-25 flu season, with Cheshire Medical Center reporting longer wait times due to respiratory illnesses, according to previous Sentinel reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;At the time of his death, Ring was beginning to consider his future. In 2022, he graduated from Fall Mountain Regional High School in Langdon, N.H., and last December he got an associate degree in sports management from N.H. Technical Institute in Concord, where he was on the soccer team. Ring was also working at Bellows Construction in Alstead, according to his family.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
      
	

   
     
   

     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;“He had a lot of things in mind that he wanted to do, he just wasn’t sure yet,” said his father, Stephen Ring. “The one thing I can say for sure is he knew he wanted to work with his hands. He wanted to work outside.” &lt;/p&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;He also had a sense of humor that “was second to none,” Stephen Ring said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    
  

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s not just a flex—it actually might be one of the simplest clues to how well you’re aging. Grip strength—the ability of your hands and forearms to grasp, hold, and carry—is emerging as a quiet, yet incredibly meaningful, predictor of longevity. The skill is linked to everything from bone health to your chances of falling, as well as how well you sleep, whether you’re depressed, and even how long you might live, according to a review in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6778477/#:~:text=Use%20of%20grip%20strength%20as,individuals%20and%20adults%20with%20pathology.---" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clinical Interventions in Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Clinical Interventions in Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Wild, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s sort of like a window into your body’s overall strength and function, Heather Milton, exercise physiologist at the NYU Langone Sports Performance Center, previously told &lt;em&gt;WH&lt;/em&gt;. Plus, it’s easy to measure on your own (more on how to do just that in a sec).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready to level up your grip strength—and upper-body power?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out the &lt;em&gt;WH+&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64409772/how-to-do-a-pull-up-strength-training-program-ultimate-pull-up-plan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ultimate Pull-Up Plan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ultimate Pull-Up Plan&lt;/a&gt;, a six-week strength training program that helps you build serious grip strength, one hang, row, and pull-up at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what’s the connection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grip strength is considered a proxy measure of overall muscle health—and muscle mass plays a critical role in everything from blood sugar regulation and cardiovascular health to mobility, balance, and even brain function. That’s why researchers increasingly see grip strength as a powerful “biomarker” of how well your body is aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stronger grip strength is associated with better outcomes in a &lt;em&gt;wide&lt;/em&gt; range of areas, including bone mineral density, cognitive function, mood, and even sleep quality, according to the study referenced earlier. The same study also linked grip strength to lower risks of developing chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease, and a reduced chance of hospitalization or long-term disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve known for a long time that maintaining muscle throughout life helps people stay healthier longer,” Milton said. “It’s really a quick way of measuring something that really represents your whole body’s muscular health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it’s not just about your hands—your grip is a reflection of how resilient and functional your body is overall. And because the muscles involved are relatively small, they tend to fatigue first, making grip a limiting factor in bigger strength movements. That’s part of what makes it such a useful signal: if your grip is struggling, there may be other strength deficits to pay attention to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s why it matters. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We lose muscle and strength with each decade after 40, but grip strength is an easy way to measure and track it,” Joanne Donoghue, PhD, director of clinical research, professor, and exercise physiologist at New York Institute of Technology medical school, previously told &lt;em&gt;WH. &lt;/em&gt;In fact, handgrip strength testing using a tool called a dynamometer is commonly used in clinical settings because it’s such a strong indicator of lean mass and physical function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, grip is often the limiting factor in strength-based moves. “If you want to deadlift heavy, but you can’t hold on to the bar, you won’t be able to pick it up,” Tina Tang, CPT, personal trainer, strength coach, and founder of Iron Strong Fitness, previously told &lt;em&gt;WH &lt;/em&gt;in an episode of the new &lt;em&gt;WH&lt;/em&gt; vodcast series, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64243271/pull-up-tips-for-beginners-ultimate-pull-up-plan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Strong Science;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Strong Science&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;“Same with pull-ups—being able to hang from the bar and hold your body weight is the first test,” Tang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Training grip strength not only helps improve your ability to lift and carry, but also supports progress in other exercises that require a solid grip—like pull-ups or rows,” Milton said. And the payoff isn’t just in the gym. Keeping your grip strong could help you stay active, capable, and independent as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dumbbells (3-30 Lb.)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure

amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try This: The Hanging Grip Strength Test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need fancy equipment to test your grip strength. A simple and revealing DIY option: See how long you can hang from a pull-up bar with control. Here’s how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with a &lt;strong&gt;dead hang&lt;/strong&gt;, letting your arms extend fully while keeping your shoulders engaged (think: pulled slightly down and back). Can you hold on for 10, 20, or even 30 seconds?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced variation: Try a &lt;strong&gt;flexed-arm hang&lt;/strong&gt;, where you hold your chin above the bar for as long as you can. (see image below)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Original Photo Credit: Justin Steele&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These kind of tests mimic real-life demands on your grip—like carrying groceries, picking up kids, or catching yourself in a fall. It also activates the same small but mighty forearm muscles that tend to fatigue first in pulling movements. And they’re seriously&lt;em&gt; tough, &lt;/em&gt;so don’t feel bad if you need some practice to even reach a five second hold.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to build your grip strength?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to dead hangs and flexed-arm holds, try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Farmer’s Carry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stand with feet hip-width and weights at outside of ankles. Hinge hips back and bend knees, keeping back flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engage core before reaching down to grab weights (again, the version above shows a variation where you're only using one weight, but if you're just starting out, you'll probably want to use two).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After gripping weights, begin to stand tall by driving heels into floor, maintaining a tight form. Once in full standing position, tighten armpits and pull shoulders back to activate muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, begin to take small steps forward, maintaining a strong grip and form. (If you're returning in opposite direction, set the weights down, turn around, and then grab the weights again)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resistance Band Pull-Apart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start standing with feet shoulder-width apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hold a resistance band taut between both hands and extend arms straight in front of the body in line with shoulders and palms facing floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engage core and pull fists outwards past shoulders. Slowly return to start. &lt;strong&gt;That's 1 rep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadlift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stand with your feet shoulder-distance apart, with a barbell, dumbbells, or kettlebell positioned in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hinge at your hips and lower down, with a slight bend in your knees, until you're far enough down to grab the bar (you can choose an overhand grip, underhand grip, or mixed grip). Keep your spine neutral by looking forward, not up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While grasping the bar, keep your shoulders back, then squeeze your glutes and your core as you stand up straight, tuck your pelvis, and lift the barbell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower back down to the ground. &lt;strong&gt;That's 1 rep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/care-services/sports-performance-center/sports-performance-center-team" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Heather Milton, CSCS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Heather Milton, CSCS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is an exercise physiologist at the NYU Langone Sports Performance Center. &lt;a href="https://site.nyit.edu/bio/jdonoghu" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Joanne Donoghue, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Joanne Donoghue, PhD&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is a director of clinical research, professor, and exercise physiologist at New York Institute of Technology medical school. &lt;a href="https://www.ironstrongfitness.net/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tina Tang, CPT,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tina Tang, CPT,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a personal trainer, strength coach, and founder of Iron Strong Fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 15:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE43RXBubkpBV2k3MlcyeGFXVHgxWTVveVBVMUtHT2NxZ29ZYThoQy1hN2p5MGZjY1V6R2Q5TWwxckNYX18wa1lBWXUxS0p2d1I4Q1VFOHZVbGhOdTNZejNNbmIyNy1tTklRaGFMaVNKNk0zaUst</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员表示， DFW报告了首例儿童麻疹病例- WFAA | First child measles case reported in DFW, health officials say - WFAA</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3wFBVV95cUxPdm1YNVZXelNsY1RfSEI5OHAzUU9MVFExaWpGc3ZnOG0wSXhRNEJhYzMtTFY2TzY2SnZqME9mT294TVRoYy1vdWJpdnBoNTV1bWk2RVBMNUo0aWJwaEkzekJ0alBQY3k1Wmwwc0NHRkpPdWRaRHhCUjQwcXJESUVxMDBkSnFGZVdJWUt1Y1UzWkxCQ3VVZmVTVjlaalBoSVhlRHk0RDFrbU9UTi0zMG9GT3p6N3hMRldZQmwwQUs4SEphUHp5UVhMd3NSaTRxWHltS2tDSTVHeXlnd203ZnhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;A student who attends Willow Springs Middle School in Lucas tested positive for measles, Collin County Health Services confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LUCAS, Texas — A Collin County middle schooler tested positive for &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;, the first known case in a child in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, Collin County Health Care Services confirmed Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials confirmed one case of measles involving a student who attends Willow Springs Middle School in Lucas, part of Lovejoy Independent School District. According to data from Texas Health and Human Services, 95% of seventh graders in Lovejoy ISD received an MMR vaccine in the 2023-2024 school year. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear if the student was vaccinated. Due to the patient's age, no additional information will be released, health officials said. It's also unclear if the case is linked to the warning Collin County health officials &lt;a href="/article/news/local/measles-plano-texas-stores-collin-county-walmart-exposure-cases/287-94b26b10-e7c7-439b-b08c-3cee0d8ac1f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;previously &lt;/a&gt;issued on April 18 about a person who tested positive for &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; and visited three stores, including a Walmart, in Plano while still infectious.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case announced Tuesday was the first known case of a child contracting the disease in the Metroplex.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two cases previously reported in Rockwall County both involved adults, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four cases of measles, including at least one child, were announced in March by the Paris-Lamar County Health District, which is located northeast of DFW.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services reported 624 cases of measles in the state of Texas on Wednesday morning. The number of cases, mostly from the January West Texas outbreak, increased by 27, the state department said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main measles outbreak has been in the South Plains region of West Texas. Most of the cases have been among unvaccinated children. Two children in Lubbock &lt;a href="/article/news/health/texas-measles-death-outbreak-lubbock/285-636380ac-1d18-4404-999d-b804f40137af" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;have died from the virus&lt;/a&gt;, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is infectious for four days before and four days after a rash appears, the release states. Measles spreads through infectious droplets and the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/vaccine-preventable-diseases/vaccine-preventable-disease-conditions/measles-rubeola" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;. It’s important to note that the measles virus can remain infectious in the air up to two hours after an infected person leaves.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
