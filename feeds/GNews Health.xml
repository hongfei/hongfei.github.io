&lt;p&gt;After more than 60 years of genetic guessing, scientists have finally cracked the code behind what makes orange cats so… orange. In &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.19.624036v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;two separate studies&lt;/a&gt; published on&lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.21.624608v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers have identified a specific &lt;strong&gt;DNA deletion&lt;/strong&gt; on the X chromosome that turns a regular cat into a fiery feline. The discovery sheds new light on how genetics drive fur color—and why orange cats are almost always male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Secret Sits In Silent DNA&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The culprit isn’t a mutation in a typical gene that codes for pigment. Instead, the answer lies in a &lt;strong&gt;non-coding region&lt;/strong&gt;—a stretch of &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/new-dna-study-reveals-neanderthals-survived-interbred-modern-humans/" data-type="post" data-id="73229"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; that doesn’t build proteins but controls how genes behave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that orange cats have a &lt;strong&gt;5,000-base-pair deletion&lt;/strong&gt; just before a gene called &lt;em&gt;Arhgap36&lt;/em&gt;. This deletion causes the gene to become overactive, especially in &lt;strong&gt;melanocytes&lt;/strong&gt;, the pigment-producing &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/11/after-death-a-new-life-takes-shape-scientists-astonishing-discovery-about-our-cells/"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; in skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/11/how-do-cats-actually-sleep/" data-type="post" data-id="72001"&gt;Cats&lt;/a&gt; with this deletion produce more &lt;em&gt;Arhgap36&lt;/em&gt; RNA—up to &lt;strong&gt;13 times more&lt;/strong&gt; than cats without it. That overactivity shifts their fur color from dark black-brown to the reddish-gold we associate with marmalade cats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How The X Chromosome Shapes A Cat’s Coat&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The orange gene sits on the &lt;strong&gt;X chromosome&lt;/strong&gt;, which helps explain one of the biggest quirks of orange cats: why most of them are male.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Male cats only have one X chromosome. If they inherit the version with the orange gene, they become fully orange. Female cats, on the other hand, have &lt;strong&gt;two X chromosomes&lt;/strong&gt;—one from each parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In female cats, one X chromosome randomly turns off in each cell. That leads to a &lt;strong&gt;patchwork of fur colors&lt;/strong&gt;, often creating tortoiseshell or calico coats. Only if a female inherits two copies of the orange gene will she&lt;strong&gt; turn out completely orange&lt;/strong&gt;—a rare event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s Really Behind Calicos And Tortoiseshells?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calicos&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;tortoiseshell cats&lt;/strong&gt; are genetic mosaics, and the orange gene plays a major role in that. But there’s another twist: a &lt;strong&gt;white-spotting gene&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tortoiseshell cats have intermingled patches of black and orange. Calicos have larger color blocks separated by white fur. That white comes from a gene that affects how pigment cells &lt;strong&gt;migrate and survive&lt;/strong&gt; as the kitten develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;So even when the orange gene is present, its visual effect depends on how these other pigment genes behave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are Orange Cats Really “Goofy”?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The internet loves to joke that orange cats are lovable but a little less sharp. And while orange tabbies have a reputation for being clingy, chaotic, or not-so-bright, there’s &lt;strong&gt;no science&lt;/strong&gt; to back that up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ARHGAP36" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arhgap36&lt;/em&gt; gene&lt;/a&gt; has known roles in development, but in cats, it seems to only activate in skin pigment cells—not the brain. That means orange fur isn’t linked to intelligence or behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Still, human perception plays a big role. Because orange cats are so visually distinct, we might be more likely to &lt;strong&gt;assign personalities&lt;/strong&gt; to them—whether or not those traits are real.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A New Chapter In Feline Genetics&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These new studies don’t just solve a long-standing mystery—they mark a &lt;strong&gt;turning point&lt;/strong&gt; in how scientists understand non-coding DNA. For decades, researchers focused mostly on protein-coding genes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, this discovery shows how even the &lt;strong&gt;“quiet” parts of the genome &lt;/strong&gt;can have big effects. And there may be more to uncover. Orange fur was just the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

This trend is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33660625/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;propelled&lt;/a&gt; by decreased stigma and increased legalization, with 24 states and the District of Columbia allowing &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/civil-and-criminal-justice/cannabis-overview" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recreational use&lt;/a&gt; (in the UK, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/11/wonder-drug-is-the-uk-ready-for-the-green-rush-of-medicinal-cannabis" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recreational use&lt;/a&gt; is still &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/penalties-drug-possession-dealing" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;illegal&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But there’s something else too.

The issue is that current science can’t prove most of the reasons why this group wants to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Despite the lack of evidence, “we do know people find it useful”, she says. “Older adults are the fastest-growing market, and there’s a reason for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;We spoke to experts about the benefits and risks of using cannabis as an older adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-cannabis" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is cannabis?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure id="68fc95e3-56c3-4541-8b04-08917662ad70" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Cannabis comes in a variety of forms.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Don Bartletti/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cannabis is a group of &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/treatment-types/complementary-and-integrative-medicine/marijuana-and-cancer/understanding-cannabis.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;plant varieties&lt;/a&gt;, or strains – notably &lt;em&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cannabis indica&lt;/em&gt;. Its main chemicals, called cannabinoids, are THC and CBD. THC has a psychoactive effect. CBD does not, but can create a feeling of relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;State laws typically require legal dispensaries to disclose the amounts of THC and CBD in products, explains &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/psych-neuro/angela-bryan" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Angela Bryan&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who studies the potential risks and benefits of cannabis use among older adults. These amounts are typically shown as a ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Regardless of whether someone wants to use cannabis recreationally or medicinally, the recommendation is to start low, go slow,” says Bryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="does-cannabis-affect-older-people-differently" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Does cannabis affect older people differently?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cannabinoids such as THC &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5877694/#:" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;bind&lt;/a&gt; to receptors in the body’s endocannabinoid system, leading to the drug’s effects. This system maintains homeostasis and regulates metabolism, but becomes less efficient with age, Bryan explains. As a result, cannabis is metabolized more slowly. That said, because people &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/nov/21/how-to-stay-healthy-in-your-50s-ageing" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;don’t age the same&lt;/a&gt;, there will be differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;If people experience relief, if they find a way to [use cannabis] that fits into their life and is safe, that is fantastic&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Angela Bryan, University of Colorado Boulder professor&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Additionally, THC can accumulate in fat. Because older adults tend to experience an increase in fat mass and a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/mar/03/health-tips-70s-longevity" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;decrease in muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;, THC effects are more pronounced, explains Moore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Older adults often take multiple medications, so they should consult a healthcare provider before using cannabis, says Moore. Some data suggests people may not adjust prescription doses when adding cannabis, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1282831/full" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increasing the risk&lt;/a&gt; of harmful side effects like impaired cognition or increased anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cannabis has become &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/legal-pot-is-more-potent-than-ever-and-still-largely-unregulated/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more potent&lt;/a&gt; over the years. Bryan advises starting with low THC before trying stronger options. Low THC may also reduce reactions like paranoia and anxiety, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-risks-of-cannabis-use-for-older-adults" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What are the risks of cannabis use for older adults?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Before using cannabis, discuss it with your doctor, says Moore. You can go over your medical history, including current and past medications, and why you want to try the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There is little clarity on which cannabis products are most effective for specific medical needs, says &lt;a href="https://hobi.med.ufl.edu/profile/kaufmann-christopher/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Christopher Kaufmann&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor at the University of Florida College of Medicine. He emphasizes the need for more research on cannabis use, specifically in older adults, who may face greater risks due to conditions like tachycardia and poor blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While there’s insufficient evidence for recommending cannabis, doctors can advise on potential benefits and risks. In older adults, common &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1064748120300828" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; like dizziness, drowsiness and confusion may increase &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/mar/31/falling-how-to-avoid-and-what-to-do" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fall risk&lt;/a&gt;, and cannabis could worsen cognitive impairment in those already affected, explains Dr Mark Lachs, chief of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If patients already use cannabis, Moore asks them to bring it to their next appointment to review whether the dosage and method of administration are appropriate. Because products can be mislabeled, she emphasizes the importance of purchasing from licensed dispensaries, where accuracy is more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Certain forms may suit specific needs better, says Bryan. For instance, smoked products offer faster relief than edibles, making them preferable for immediate pain. But if you have a history of lung disease, avoid vaping and smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A downside of edibles is that you can’t undo overconsumption. “People tend not to oversmoke,” Bryan says. “They feel the effect they want and stop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-23" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Three-quarters of participants found it “somewhat” or “extremely” helpful. While such use is common, scientific evidence supporting these health benefits is limited. Research is stronger on cannabis’s &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/cannabis-marijuana-and-cannabinoids-what-you-need-to-know" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;effectiveness&lt;/a&gt; for neuropathic pain, spasticity and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="dc3bf3f1-527a-446f-93b1-4941b1b46ba0" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":26,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Falling can be risky.

Bryan calls for more double-blind randomized controlled trials using legal cannabis products, though these are challenging to conduct because of the tightly regulated schedule I status of cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Self-reported benefits still matter, Bryan says, even if there’s a placebo effect. “If people experience relief, if they find a way to do it that fits into their life and is safe for them, then that is fantastic,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Moore thinks cannabis has “the potential to address some of the common issues we see with ageing”, but the barriers to studying it have impeded progress. Because short-term use of cannabis &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460321004068" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;may improve&lt;/a&gt; positive mood, this might explain why people find it helpful, regardless of whether cause and effect can be validated, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aarongreensteinmd.com/#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Aaron Greenstein&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified geriatric psychiatrist, says patients inquire about cannabis for sleep, pain and general wellbeing. But whether it’s helpful, and how much, can be very subjective, he says, and he’s observed that most of his patients who have hoped cannabis could help with wellbeing end up not sticking with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Part of the fascination with marijuana is that it is advertised as a quick fix,” he says. “But there’s a limit to how effective it can be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-cannabis-help-older-adults-sleep-better" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Can cannabis help older adults sleep better?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a 2020 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572650/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on people aged 21 to 70, Bryan and colleagues found that frequent use of edibles for sleep was linked to poorer sleep over time. She notes this pattern mirrors findings on other sleep aids: they work initially but lose effectiveness eventually. Sparing, as-needed use is generally more helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study also found participants, especially older adults, slept better with higher CBD intake. While products with more THC may offer short-term relief, those with high-dose CBD and low-dose THC were better for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A combination of occasional CBD use along with some behavioral changes is probably the best recommendation” for people experiencing persistent, disruptive sleep problems, says Bryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Moore has come across seniors who want to transition from hypnotic medications, like Ambien, to cannabis. But there’s a lack of data comparing the two, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When it comes to improving sleep, there are often more effective alternatives to cannabis and medications such as Ambien, says Lachs. These include options like gabapentin and melatonin, but he particularly recommends behavioral interventions like &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/sep/23/cbt-i-sleep-therapy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CBT-I&lt;/a&gt;, or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Ultimately, “the jury is still out on whether cannabis can be used to treat sleep”, says Kaufmann. “There definitely needs to be more studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNb3lONU81eTBzUzZMekRLRHNXOFVKME92V1paSjBuejhONFZuTVBZTm5UMURzNG0wVmJrRzJoNEJpM01IWExEZkZlSllPSXRVb0g4R0doYkhUbVppbG1taVQ1MGNBNnhyekVFV190RXdyMWVnYS1hNk1keWswbU9BWHpSSlpBemZTdktwYg</guid></item><item><title>国际空间站正处于“其存在的最危险时期” ，美国宇航局安全小组警告- Gizmodo | The ISS Is in the ‘Riskiest Period of Its Existence,’ NASA Safety Panel Warns - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPSGp3Q0M4cWJpY0VBWXlXWDBvUUxINHhxdU5idDAybzNnaFA0VzZPaDhld3V1QVlzM0F6VDR0anpDZEE2dVNwTmNobHQ4VU1DUHFvMFl0QldkSlNQY2RtZXRYdVBwMDZIdnVxYjdUeGlybzBMSnI1V2N0anVaeWhRNnlob0RxUFVJbHR2d0paZEw1U09ybnRIVko0Sm9JczlYMEItaUJBb1U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;The International Space Station (ISS) has been orbiting Earth since 1998, housing groups of astronauts in the microgravity environment around 250 miles above the surface of the planet. All of that time in space has taken a toll on its aging hardware, and the space station is due to retire within the next few years. Until then, however, safety experts are warning of long-running issues that threaten the safety of the ISS, and the crew on board.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a meeting of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) held on Thursday, members of a NASA safety panel stated that there are growing risks threatening the space station as it nears the end of its use, SpaceNews &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/nasa-safety-panel-warns-of-increasing-risks-to-iss-operations/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. “The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence,” Rich Williams, a member of the panel, said during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the top of the list of growing risks is a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-iss-is-leaking-air-and-nasa-and-russia-cant-agree-why-2000524781"&gt;leak where air has been escaping at an increasing rate&lt;/a&gt; from a tunnel that connects a docking port to a Russian module. In 2019, Russia’s space agency Roscosmos reported the detection of an air leak found in the vestibule (named PrK) that connects a docking port to the Russian Zvezda module, which the space agency had launched to low Earth orbit in July 2000. The rate of air that has been leaking from Russia’s Zvezda module had doubled from one pound of air per day in 2019 to a little over two pounds around a week before the launch of the Progress MS-26 cargo spacecraft in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Both NASA and Roscosmos have been monitoring the air leak since then, and officials from the two space agencies are scheduled to meet later this month to update mitigation efforts for the growing safety concern, according to Williams. A report issued in late 2024 &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/growing-air-leak-in-russian-segment-now-deemed-greatest-iss-risk-report-reveals-2000505190"&gt;elevated the air leak to the highest level of risk&lt;/a&gt; based on its likelihood and severity. In the meantime, the source of the leak remains unknown. The astronauts on board the ISS are prepared to close the hatch to the service module when access is not required in order to minimize the amount of air lost, as well as to isolate the leak itself from the rest of the space station.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another safety issue addressed during the meeting is the lack of a deorbit plan for the ISS in case of an emergency. NASA is in the process of solidifying &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/an-excruciatingly-detailed-breakdown-of-how-nasa-plans-1851545016"&gt;a plan to ditch the nearly one-million pound space station in 2030&lt;/a&gt;, sending it flying through Earth’s atmosphere to mostly burn up from the heat, with its remaining bits ending up at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean in a controlled reentry. But as of now, NASA has no emergency plan in place to deorbit the ISS, and that’s a big problem. If NASA is forced to destroy the space station ahead of its retirement, then it increases the risk of ISS debris falling on inhabited areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the [U.S. Deorbit Vehicle] is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude,” Williams said, according to SpaceNews. &lt;/span&gt;The panel highlighted other issues with the ISS, including having enough spare parts for life support systems on board and delays with cargo deliveries. Williams blamed these issues on “ISS budget shortfall.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“As programs near final phases, it is tempting to assume less resources will need to be available,” Williams said. “For the ISS, it is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle is safely reentered.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A small Oregon county has been struck by one of the rarest but scariest ailments known to exist. Health officials in Hood River County have reported an unusual cluster of people coming down with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three residents in the area have contracted CJD over the past eight months, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.hoodrivercounty.gov/index.asp?SEC=AF40862A-8B0E-4107-B2B4-956029C71941&amp;amp;DE=11E4744C-DDC6-4DBD-8F95-B86EFBB310E6"&gt;Hood River County Health Department&lt;/a&gt;, two of whom are already dead. Local and federal health officials are now investigating the cluster, but they have not identified a link between the cases to date.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/prions/about/index.html"&gt;CJD and similar brain diseases&lt;/a&gt; are caused by a misfolded version of the naturally occurring prion protein. When these rogue proteins come into contact with their harmless brethren, they convert them into more misfolded prions, acting almost like a zombie invasion. The accumulation of prions steadily destroys the brain, though it can take years or even decades for symptoms to appear. Once they do, however, death quickly follows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thankfully for humanity, prion ailments are rare (other prion-like diseases might be &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-molecular-devils-that-cause-the-most-fatal-diseases-ever-known-2000511979"&gt;more common&lt;/a&gt;). While CJD is the most common prion disease, only around 500 new cases of it are estimated to happen in the U.S. annually. This rarity makes three cases showing up so close together in the same relatively small county (roughly 24,000 people live in Hood River) all the weirder.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;CJD can broadly happen in three different ways. It can be passed down from mutations that make the emergence of prions inevitable. It can be transmitted, though usually only through rare scenarios such as close contact with infected brain tissue. Or it can simply occur sporadically for no clear reason.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most CJD cases fall in the last bucket. But over &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-happened-to-mad-cow-disease-history-prions-1851242160"&gt;thirty years ago&lt;/a&gt;, there was an outbreak of CJD caused by tainted cow meat (this specific form of CJD came to be known as variant CJD). As it turns out, the cows were infected with their own version of a prion disease—a condition formally called bovine spongiform encephalopathy, but more memorably known as mad cow disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mad cow/vCJD outbreak was contained by the mid-1990s, and only a few hundred people were ever sickened by prion-infected beef. But it showed that prion diseases can be more transmissible than we thought, and even today, scientists still worry about the possibility of similar events happening again. In North America, for instance, a prion disease has been steadily spreading among deer in recent years, though there is &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/prions-venison-deer-meat-brain-disease-mad-cow-guide-1851547274"&gt;no solid evidence yet&lt;/a&gt; that it poses a threat to people.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For that reason, anytime a cluster of CJD does appear, it tends to set off public health alarms. The bunching together of these cases in Hood River, Oregon—one confirmed, two suspected—might simply be pure, if unlucky, coincidence. But it remains important to rule out the scarier scenario. For now, there’s no immediate signs of something more being amiss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“At this time, there is no identifiable link between these three cases,” the Hood River County Health Department said in its latest statement on the cluster, released Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The health department is still monitoring the situation, in conjunction with the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But as they rightly note, the general risk of CJD to the public is very low.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When you exercise before bed, it could result in you getting a bad night of sleep (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And when you exert energy, your body temperature rises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Kaylor said that this can be a problem as a decline in core temperature is a critical signal to your body to initiate sleep.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If your body is still warm and alert from a late workout, it may take hours to return to a sleep-ready state,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you're thinking, 'Well, I'm exhausted after my workouts and fall asleep easily,' that actually doesn't necessarily mean you're getting good sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Kaylor explained that even if you fall asleep shortly after an evening workout, there are still lingering elevations of adrenaline and cortisol in your body that can reduce the quality of your sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These hormones are actively working to give you less time in deep and REM stages of your sleep - something essential for physical recovery, memory processing, and emotional resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said when this happens, your sleep becomes lighter, more fragmented and less restorative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it's not just your body that remains active - it's your brain as well as there's a lot more mental engagement that goes into workouts than you'd think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Working out too close to your bedtime can make your sleep lighter, more fragmented, and less restorative (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Whether you're focused on your form, tracking your progress, or riding the emotional high of a new personal best, your brain may remain active long after your body stops moving,' Dr. Kaylor explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So if you're someone who only has the time to work out after you're done with the workday, where does that leave you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For many people juggling work, family, and daily obligations, the only time available to exercise may be in the evening,' Dr. Kaylor said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In those cases, there are ways to reap the benefits of movement while minimizing sleep disruption.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, she explained that your best bet is to give yourself three hours between your workout and your bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Kaylor also suggested 'exercise snacks.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These are short bursts of physical activity spread throughout the day rather than one long workout,' she dished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sleep expert Dr. Leah Kaylor said 'exercise snacks' - short bursts of physical activity spread throughout the day - can be an alternative to long, evening workouts &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research shows that as long as you're getting 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week - even if it's done broken up into just 5-10 minutes at a time - you can still reap great health and sleep benefits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These micro-workouts provide flexibility, reduce the risk of overtraining, and are particularly useful for beginners, those recovering from injury, or anyone with a packed schedule,' the expert said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with this, she said that a proper wind-down routine at bedtime is essential to prepare your body for a good night's sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By making consistent, intentional choices, you can support your sleep, health, and fitness goals - without needing a perfect schedule or a full hour at the gym,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Myelin loss is common in disorders like multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, and this research shows that hnRNP A1 disruptions can impair myelination at the molecular level, even before behavioral symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a rodent model, scientists induced and later reversed demyelination to track the effects on memory, motor function, and social behavior. The findings offer fresh insight into how early molecular changes in myelin-related proteins could contribute to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, potentially opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myelin Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; Disruption of hnRNP A1 impairs myelin production and may play a role in schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silent Molecular Shifts:&lt;/strong&gt; Changes in myelin-related proteins occurred without immediate behavioral symptoms, suggesting early markers of disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversibility Observed:&lt;/strong&gt; Restoring myelin reversed behavioral deficits in rodents, underscoring therapeutic potential.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;FAPESP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neurochemistry&lt;/em&gt; has detailed the role of a protein, hnRNP A1, in the formation and stability of myelin, suggesting an important impact on neurodegenerative diseases and mental disorders such as multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings pave the way for new research and potential treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myelin is a fatty substance produced by oligodendrocytes (cells of the central nervous system) that forms a sheath, like a kind of “insulator.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It “protects” the extensions of neurons (axons) and increases the conduction speed of nerve impulses that carry information between neural cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific literature has shown that patients with multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia lose myelin (called demyelination), leaving part of the axons “unplugged” and causing damage to brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rodent study examined changes in proteins essential for myelin production (myelination). The results highlight the involvement of hnRNP A1 in maintaining the integrity of this protective sheath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;hnRNP A1 regulates the processing of messenger RNA, i.e., it controls how the molecule is cut and assembled (splicing), thereby determining which proteins are produced and in what amounts. Studied for years by this group of scientists at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, hnRNP A1 had already figured prominently in previous research carried out on brain tissue from people with schizophrenia and on cells grown in the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I was a master’s student, I worked with oligodendrocyte predecessor cell lines and their responses to antipsychotics. This protein, hnRNP A1, always appeared. We decided to try to understand its role in oligodendrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But to do this, we had to use an animal model to induce myelination and understand the process,” explains Caroline Brandão Teles, first author of the article and FAPESP doctoral fellow at the Institute of Biology (IB-UNICAMP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For researcher Fernanda Crunfli, also from IB-UNICAMP and corresponding author of the paper, myelin has been an important target of study for neuropsychiatric diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were able to analyze the demyelination process in the animals and then restore the myelin sheath. This allowed for an interesting study window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did behavioral tests to assess locomotion, short- and long-term memory, and social interaction. When the myelin is restored, all these functions return to the brain,” says Crunfli, who was a FAPESP postdoctoral fellow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teles points out that this was one of the results that caught the group’s attention – the fact that the changes were detected at the molecular level, without affecting the animals’ behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this molecular and non-behavioral alteration, the work has the interesting potential to pinpoint an important protein in the establishment of schizophrenia. This same animal model is analyzed in research on multiple sclerosis, for example, and when there’s a behavioral study, changes are noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the case of schizophrenia, the fact that the behavior isn’t altered indicates, in my opinion, that this protein is essential in the development of the disease and may have an influence on its genesis,” Professor Daniel Martins-de-Souza, from IB-UNICAMP, Teles’ supervisor and head of the Neuroproteomics Laboratory, told Agência FAPESP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by loss of contact with reality (psychosis), hallucinations, delusions, and impaired cognition, among other symptoms. The exact cause is still unknown, but recent research suggests a combination of hereditary factors and molecular and functional alterations in the brain. Treatment includes antipsychotic medications and psychotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that approximately 1.6 million people in Brazil have schizophrenia. Worldwide, the prevalence is about 1% of the world’s population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Martins-de-Souza’s research group has been working to understand the role of oligodendrocytes in schizophrenia and has managed to map a series of brain proteins that help to unravel the molecular basis of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To understand the research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group used a rodent (murine) model that has also been studied in cases of multiple sclerosis, a disease characterized by severe demyelination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the eighth week of the experiment, demyelination was induced and continued for another five weeks. The process was then interrupted and the myelin sheath was restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this time, the researchers analyzed the activity of hnRNP A1. “We saw that the proteins linked to myelin in these animals were all reduced. By disrupting the activity of this protein [&lt;em&gt;hnRNP A1&lt;/em&gt;], we ended up disrupting myelination,” says Teles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists believe that studying the impact of the protein’s alterations on synaptic transmission and cognitive processes could reveal new therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to the grants, the research was also supported by FAPESP through six other projects (17/25588-1, 19/05155-9, 18/01410-1, 23/08885-3, 18/01669-5 and 23/11514-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this schizophrenia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0c647e696562697e784c6a6d7c697f7c226e7e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Heloisa Reinert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://fapesp.br" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FAPESP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Heloisa Reinert – FAPESP&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jnc.16304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Impacts of hnRNP A1 Splicing Inhibition on the Brain Remyelination Proteome&lt;/a&gt;” by Caroline Brandão Teles et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neurochemistry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impacts of hnRNP A1 Splicing Inhibition on the Brain Remyelination Proteome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells in the central nervous system, are implicated in several neurological disorders marked by dysfunctional RNA–binding proteins (RBPs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present study aimed at investigating the role of hnRNP A1 in the proteome of the corpus callosum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus of a murine cuprizone–induced demyelination model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right after the cuprizone insult, we administered an hnRNP A1 splicing activity inhibitor and analyzed its impact on brain remyelination by nanoESI-LC-MS/MS label-free proteomic analysis to assess the biological processes affected in these brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant alterations in essential myelination proteins highlighted the involvement of hnRNP A1 in maintaining myelin integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathways related to sphingolipid and endocannabinoid signaling were affected, as well as the synaptic vesicle cycle and GABAergic synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although behavioral impairments were not observed, molecular changes suggest potential links to memory, synaptic function, and neurotransmission processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings enhance our understanding of the multifaceted roles of hnRNP A1 in the central nervous system, providing valuable insights for future investigations and therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative and demyelinating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

Alongside the back pain, she developed a persistent cough, stomach issues, and strange bruises that refused to fade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, she chalked it up to fatigue and a lingering cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time doctors took a closer look, it was too late. The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-26d04ad0-1c58-11f0-805a-97be76b02f96"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, quietly growing in her breast for years, had already spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests revealed it had reached both breasts, her spine, liver, and pelvis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That’s when doctors delivered the devastating news no young mother expects: she had just 18 to 24 months to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kate Crawford was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer at 28 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kate initially blamed her symptoms on being a busy mom of three young kids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;That was 12 years ago, and against all odds, Kate, now 41, has survived stage 4 metastatic breast cancer and is on a mission to check things off her bucket list and make lasting memories with her husband and children.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She said she knows she will never be cured of cancer, but is 'thankful' to still be alive. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kate is also determined to educate others on the lesser-known signs of cancer and teach them to advocate for themselves. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Looking back, she realizes how her seemingly unrelated symptoms were all subtle signs of cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kate&lt;/span&gt; used to blamed her upset stomach on a bad diet and when the cough she had wouldn't go away after several months, she thought she 'was having trouble shaking a cold.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But these were all signs of cancer. I had no clue,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kate continued: 'I just thought I was tired because I was a new mom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But it wasn't just exhaustion — I was bone-tired, with belly issues, a cough that lingered for months, and bruises that never went away.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'If the doctor had just done an x-ray, he would've seen I had cancer. One day, I was a 28-year-old mom of babies, and the next, I was being told I might not be here much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn't know what to look for. If I had been more educated in the signs, I might have been able to better advocate for myself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It may be too late for me, but it's not for you. If something doesn't feel right, please don't ignore it.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kate said: &lt;/span&gt;'I didn't know the signs. That's what I want people to take away from this. Know your body. Don't ignore your gut. It might just save your life.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kate has undergone 200 cancer treatments, including a double mastectomy &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kate said less than 13 percent of metastatic breast cancer patients survive as long as she has with the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After her diagnosis of breast cancer, which affects about 317,000 women annually, she immediately started aggressive treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has had more than 200 treatments, including a double mastectomy, and has spent nearly a third of her life in a relentless battle for survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While treatable, metastatic breast cancer cannot be cured and about 42,000 women die of the disease each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The five-year survival rate for stage 4 breast cancer is 22 percent and Kate said less than 13 percent of metastatic breast cancer patients survive as long as she has with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At times her treatment has been far from straightforward. She has had allergic reactions, heart failure and even developed early-stage lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she has kept fighting, adapting her life around the three week treatment cycle and her changing body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'A stage 4 diagnosis means treatment for life and side effects for life. When one thing pops up, you just have to deal with it. Take it one step at a time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That time lets me relax and unwind. It reminds me to look for the glimmers.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kate credits her strength to survive to her husband Steve and their children, twins Grace and Lily, now 16, and Stephen, 15, who are constantly at her side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And she concentrates on small joys - from floating in a lake on a calm day, laughing with her kids, or discovering a new outfit that fits just right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;More than a decade after her diagnosis, Kate has adapted her life around the three week treatment cycle and her changing body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kate said: 'I just want to keep making memories with my family. That's all I've ever wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while she enjoys sharing her journey on social media, she warns against toxic positivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've never tried to sugarcoat my life, but people forget the daily struggles. We hide a lot, not for ourselves but to make others feel better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's ok to feel not ok. You don't always have to be the brave, stoic cancer patient. You can be mad, bitter, sad and still be full of love. That is perfectly ok. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kate continued: 'Getting diagnosed with cancer is like jumping into a big metaphorical lake full of other cancer patients.

			&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-blood-could-be-aging-your-brain-increasing-risk-of-dementia"&gt;global population ages&lt;/a&gt;, more of us face frightening cognitive decline, personally or in our loved ones. There are over &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;10 million new cases&lt;/a&gt; of dementia globally each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a study published last year suggests up to 13 percent of people diagnosed with dementia in the US may have a misdiagnosis and are instead left struggling with a condition that can be treated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Health care providers [must be] made aware of this potential overlap between dementia and hepatic encephalopathy, which is treatable," &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/news/13-percent-of-patients-with-dementia-may-instead-have-cognitive-decline-from-cirrhosis"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Virginia Commonwealth University hepatologist Jasmohan Bajaj in July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy"&gt;Hepatic encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt; – cognitive impairment caused by liver failure – impacts more than 40 percent of patients with advanced liver disease (&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cirrhosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351487"&gt;cirrhosis&lt;/a&gt;). The brain impairments it causes are hard to distinguish from dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/liver-anatomy-and-functions"&gt;Our livers regulate&lt;/a&gt; the levels of most chemicals in our bodies, from filtering them from the blood to aiding with digestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the well-known &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-what-happens-to-your-liver-when-you-quit-alcohol"&gt;liver-damaging effects of alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, other risks to the liver include the hepatitis  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="158513" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;, high cholesterol, obesity and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="158513" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, stress, and aging. But if caught early enough and with the right treatment, damage to our livers can be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this can be mitigated through changes in diet and behavior, and there are even more &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-024-00652-w"&gt;potential drug treatments&lt;/a&gt; on the horizon as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145448" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642.jpg" alt="An older woman with grey hair and glasses, talking on the phone" class="size-full wp-image-145448" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642-603x415.jpg 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642-600x413.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145448" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Up to 13 percent of people diagnosed with dementia in the US may have a misdiagnosis. (Rido/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, treatment of hepatic encephalopathy has resolved cognitive impairments in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2022.04.035"&gt;at least two patients&lt;/a&gt; who had been diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-024-00652-w"&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; in mice suggests that even the impacts of aging on the liver may be reversible if caught early enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've shown that aging exacerbates non-alcoholic liver disease… and by reducing this impact, we can reverse the damage," &lt;a href="https://corporate.dukehealth.org/news/study-shows-how-liver-damage-stress-and-aging-might-be-reversible"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; Duke University hepatologist Anna Mae. "You are never too old to get better."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.53965"&gt;In an earlier 2024 study&lt;/a&gt;, Bajaj and colleagues reviewed the medical records of 177,422 US veterans diagnosed with dementia between 2009 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of them had been diagnosed with liver disease, but the team found over 10 percent had high fibrosis 4 (FIB-4) scores, an index to measure liver scarring, meaning &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/many-dementia-cases-could-actually-be-a-hidden-form-of-liver-disease"&gt;they were very likely to have cirrhosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_132698" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132698" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/StagesOfLiverDamageDiagramMASLD.jpg" alt="diagram showing the different stages of liver damage" class="wp-image-132698 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/StagesOfLiverDamageDiagramMASLD.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/StagesOfLiverDamageDiagramMASLD-642x514.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/StagesOfLiverDamageDiagramMASLD-518x415.jpg 518w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/StagesOfLiverDamageDiagramMASLD-600x480.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132698" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cirrhosis is the result of persistent liver damage, where healthy tissue has been gradually replaced with scar tissue. (&lt;a href="https://corporate.dukehealth.org/news/study-shows-how-liver-damage-stress-and-aging-might-be-reversible"&gt;Kuo Du &lt;em&gt;et al., Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;, 2024&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Virginia Commonwealth University biostatistician Scott Silvey, Bajaj, and colleagues repeated this review with 68,807 medical records of patients from a national database who aren't veterans, to see if their earlier results reflected the general US population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To their surprise, even more patients with high FIB-4 scores were found in this population – almost 13 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The prevalences and determinants of a high FIB-4 are striking, including a greater proportion of patients who were not white in the high FIB-4 group," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2024.06.014"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; Silvey and team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While we did not study the specific factors behind these disparities, a lack of access to therapy or medical care in both dementia care and comorbidity care could contribute."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once our livers start to malfunction, it &lt;a href="https://corporate.dukehealth.org/news/study-shows-how-liver-damage-stress-and-aging-might-be-reversible"&gt;stresses other tissues&lt;/a&gt; in our bodies, including kidneys, pancreas, and heart, as well as our brains. So it makes sense to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-single-adjustment-to-just-one-meal-can-benefit-liver-disease-patients"&gt;prioritize our liver health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This important link between dementia and liver health emphasizes the importance of screening patients for potentially treatable contributors to cognitive decline," &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/news/13-percent-of-patients-with-dementia-may-instead-have-cognitive-decline-from-cirrhosis"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Bajaj.&lt;/p&gt;

Brisk walking for only a few minutes each day could be enough to greatly reduce your risk of some heart conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study, led by researchers at the University of Glasgow, United Kingdom, has found that walking at a brisk pace (more than 4 miles per hour) can reduce the risk of heart rhythm abnormalities, or &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8887#types-and-causes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiac arrhythmias;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiac arrhythmias&lt;/a&gt;, by as much as 43%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://heart.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/heartjnl-2024-325004" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Heart;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Heart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;suggests that brisk walking could be a safe and effective way to reduce heart rhythm abnormalities, particularly in those at higher risk of developing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the largest study that has shown physical activity lowers the risk of arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation and importantly also shows that the quality of the exercise is even more important. These findings give us more ammunition to help us counsel our patients to regularly exercise and exercise at a good pace to help them decrease their risk of cardiovascular disease including arrhythmias.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/paul-c-drury" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Paul Drury, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Paul Drury, MD&lt;/a&gt;, board certified cardiologist and associate medical director of electrophysiology at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are heart arrhythmias?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart rhythm abnormalities, or irregular heartbeats, affect &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558923/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:up to 5%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;up to 5%&lt;/a&gt; of the global population.

Over the 7.9-year median follow-up period, 4,117 (5.1%) of these people developed arrhythmias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who spent more time walking briskly tended to be younger, male, have overall healthier lifestyles, lower BMI, and be less deprived, all factors that may reduce the risk of arrhythmias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even after adjusting for these factors, the researchers found that spending more time walking at an average pace was associated with a 27% lower risk of cardiac arrhythmias, and an 18% lower risk for walking at a brisk pace.

Researchers tested this by having participants perform a 10-minute visual attention task while emotionally charged images appeared in the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negative images, such as a crying baby, disrupted task performance more than neutral or positive images and were remembered better afterward. These findings provide insight into how emotional distractions interfere with focus and could aid treatments for anxiety and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disruption by Emotion:&lt;/strong&gt; Upsetting distractions cause slower, less accurate performance on attention tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Bias:&lt;/strong&gt; Negative distractors are more likely to be remembered than neutral or positive ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may help identify attention vulnerabilities in anxiety and PTSD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Boston University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The world is full of distractions, like intrusive memories, worries about the future and reminders of things to do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sustained attention, the ability to maintain focus on a specific stimulus or task for an extended period without significant lapses in concentration, is a foundational cognitive process that underlies many other cognitive functions, impacts daily functioning and is commonly impaired across a diverse population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108875"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of a person." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers found that when the backgrounds were upsetting, participants were both slower and less accurate at the sustained attention task. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While upsetting thoughts and experiences can disrupt one’s ability to focus attention while performing everyday tasks, translating this phenomenon to the laboratory has remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers from Boston University Chobanian &amp;amp; Avedisian School of Medicine and VA Boston Healthcare System have shown that when people are sustaining attention, distractions that are upsetting or unpleasant are most likely to disrupt that focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope these findings will assist in treating anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that negative distractions disrupted ongoing task performance as well as impacted  the participants’ mood by making them feel worse,” explained corresponding author Michael Esterman, PhD, principal investigator in the VA’s National Center for PTSD and BU associate professor of psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two groups of approximately 60 participants performed a series of tasks (called the gradCPT) requiring them to sustain their visual attention for about 10 minutes without a break, while photos of distractions would sometimes fade in and out in the background on a video monitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These visual distractions could be upsetting (a crying baby), neutral (a chair), or positive (a smiling baby).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that when the backgrounds were upsetting, participants were both slower and less accurate at the sustained attention task. After the task was completed, participants were tested for their memory of the background distractor, even though they were told to ignore these distractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found the upsetting distractors were remembered better than those that were neutral or positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe this study will help scientists measure how distractible a person is, what is most distracting to them, and whether those distractions intrude in their memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also believe it can open new opportunities to study attention in clinical populations and their neural mechanism alongside brain imaging, both of which are directions we are currently pursuing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings appear online in the journal &lt;em&gt;Behavior Research Methods&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding for this study was provided by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs through a Merit Review Award from the VA Clinical Sciences Research and Development Service (1I01CX002711-01) to J.D and M.E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory and attention research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#84e3edeae5e0c4e6f1aae1e0f1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gina DiGravio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://bu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Boston University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Gina DiGravio – Boston University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13428-025-02641-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Characterizing the effects of emotional distraction on sustained attention and subsequent memory: A novel emotional gradual onset continuous performance task&lt;/a&gt;” by Michael Esterman et al. &lt;em&gt;Behavioral Research Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characterizing the effects of emotional distraction on sustained attention and subsequent memory: A novel emotional gradual onset continuous performance task&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examines the impact of emotional distraction on sustained attention using a novel gradual onset continuous performance task (gradCPT). Sustained attention is a foundational cognitive process, vulnerable to both internal (endogenous) and external (exogenous) disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reliable, validated paradigms to assess internal sources of variation in sustained attention have been used to characterize basic aspects of attention as well as individual differences and neurobiological mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, sustained attention can also be disrupted by external distraction, especially highly salient distractors, due to their affective and/or arousing nature. Markedly less work has been conducted to develop reliable and validated paradigms to study these effects on sustained attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a novel task, the emogradCPT, to characterize the impact of emotional distractors (background images) on the ability to sustain attention during an emotionally neutral task (digit discrimination task).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across two experiments and three rounds of data collection, we demonstrate that emotionally negative distractors robustly and reliably disrupt ongoing ability to sustain attention, reflected in reduced accuracy, and slower RTs, relative to neutral, positive, and no distractor conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, we validated the task by correlating objective and subjective measures of distraction, as well as demonstrating the impact of these distractors on downstream memory encoding and affect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making these data and tools publicly available, we encourage the use of this paradigm to inform future basic, clinical, and neuroimaging studies of affective interactions with ongoing goal-directed attentional processes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 12:48:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE54R0tIa3lFMFdEOWFZVU53eFQ0M0pmTUF3WWJpSTBEZVkwS0paNW02QVRiU0loamxyWkY0eHRTQUVIb09HUFZZb1lvdExNcDBsTXdBVmhrRHFxQnBFS0t4UFFyOUpYOUhlZFlGbE1wY0lGMjY0cVBBV1duRVZuQQ</guid></item><item><title>肉类蛋白质促进生存，但植物促进长寿- Earth.com | Meat protein boosts survival, but plants boost longevity - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOUTV0ZnByckg5MDVydjZwNVdnSTJjMUozYjI0WXhESzNqYktSRXdwXzlVY1AtN3FWcWtESHZGWWhVQm1Yb0tXZHY1dld3WjZmZlFwS2FMTFkxUnlWZTQxbkxhUzVQUVpTRVltYnpPQW16ZFNyLUxRNlhUdGl5TXRzc3BfWG5EMnVfOF9Z?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research points to protein-rich food choices as powerful drivers of health. Many people are now asking whether a meat-heavy approach to protein is truly the best strategy when it comes to living longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent findings show that countries with higher levels of animal-based protein see lower mortality rates among children under five, yet plant-based protein is linked with longer lifespans for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted out by PhD candidate Caitlin Andrews and her team, led by Dr. Alistair Senior at the &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-plants-to-meat-protein"&gt;From plants to meat &lt;strong&gt;protein&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Populations worldwide seem to be trading vegetables for meat. Researchers have observed that animal-based protein consumption has climbed across various regions over the past several decades. More societies are gravitating toward protein-dense foods derived from cattle, poultry, and pigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shifts are not uniform, though. In several corners of the globe, chickpeas, beans, and other legumes are still mainstays, along with certain dairy and egg products. In resource-constrained nations, individuals often rely on whatever is the most affordable form of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meat-protein-lowers-child-death-rates"&gt;Meat protein lowers child death rates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/child-mortality-under-5-years" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;under-fives&lt;/a&gt;, a food system that supplies large amounts of animal-based proteins and fats lowered rates of infant mortality,” said Andrews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In places where young children miss out on ample nutrition, extra amounts of animal-based protein can be tied to better early survival rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One explanation involves the nutrients found in eggs, dairy, and meat. These foods contain essential amino acids, iron, zinc, and vitamins that help children grow. They also provide energy-dense fat, which supports early development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families who live in impoverished settings, however, often struggle to access such staples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plant-protein-helps-adults-live-longer"&gt;Plant protein helps adults live longer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For adults, plant-based proteins increased overall life expectancy,” said Andrews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher plant-based protein intake appears to bring key advantages. Diets built around legumes, peas, lentils, and nuts are linked with fewer chronic conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.924977" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults who rely on beans, lentils, or tofu may also get more dietary fiber. That &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates/fiber/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; supports normal digestion and can lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. Meanwhile, too much red or processed meat is often linked with harmful effects that might shorten lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-good-fats-early-less-later"&gt;Good fats early, less later&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another interesting aspect involves fat. Research suggests that in infancy and early childhood, certain animal fats might help reduce malnutrition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in life, though, cutting back on high-fat products can aid weight management, possibly easing issues like &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572145/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4314-hypertension-high-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods loaded with saturated fat may disrupt the balance if combined with processed sugars and a sedentary lifestyle. Such combinations might trigger an inflammatory state and higher vulnerability to illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern emphasizes how dietary composition can be more important than any single &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/animals-are-suffering-from-declining-plant-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nutrient&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-higher-cost-for-the-planet"&gt;A higher cost for the planet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Protein is a crucial part of the human diet, but as eating habits change and developed countries look to decarbonize, where we get our protein from has come under greater scrutiny,” noted the research team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meat production draws attention for environmental reasons. Livestock farming typically requires more land and water compared to growing legumes or grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those aiming to reduce &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt; often look to pea or chickpea farming as lower-impact methods. This is sparking interest in alternative proteins, such as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-based-foods-promote-weight-loss-regardless-of-processing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plant-based&lt;/a&gt; meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these shifts need to be carefully approached, given how vital animal-sourced protein appears to be for child development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shifting-protein-needs"&gt;Shifting protein needs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What each person puts on the plate can differ by budget and culture. For families with small children, variety may be the safest bet. Adults seeking to improve their longevity might gain from swapping out meat for beans, peas, or other plant-based sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some individuals find plant protein more economical, while others view meat as a valued tradition. Experts advise that local resources and medical concerns shape the ideal balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best approach might be a mixed plan, adjusting as people move from childhood into later stages of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rethinking-protein-for-global-well-being"&gt;Rethinking protein for global well-being &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results highlight a pattern: keep an eye on total protein intake first, then prioritize more plant-based sources past childhood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future innovations may focus on improving vegetarian options for children at risk of malnutrition. Researchers also stress the need for more accessible programs, especially in areas with low food security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifting the global menu can pose challenges. It involves policy support, agricultural reforms, and nutrition education. The end goal is to see infants thrive and older people enjoy extra years, while also safeguarding natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58475-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 12:26:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOUTV0ZnByckg5MDVydjZwNVdnSTJjMUozYjI0WXhESzNqYktSRXdwXzlVY1AtN3FWcWtESHZGWWhVQm1Yb0tXZHY1dld3WjZmZlFwS2FMTFkxUnlWZTQxbkxhUzVQUVpTRVltYnpPQW16ZFNyLUxRNlhUdGl5TXRzc3BfWG5EMnVfOF9Z</guid></item><item><title>意图如何塑造行动感知-神经科学新闻 | How Intent Shapes Perception of Action - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTFBONjZZcy1ET1AtUDBIOVp4dXg1dXBzd05yUHF4ZHlLbVlreFRWUXhBamNmSlYxSzg1MXA3SU1tQW9xQXpsY0daUkU1eGFRV0hubnZJWkdYc0hhYmlqSkVsNkJxcE5qQjVLY1dkTEctYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A groundbreaking study used a brain-machine interface to explore how intentions, actions, and their outcomes are temporally linked in the human brain. By recording single-neuron activity from a paralyzed individual with implanted electrodes, researchers enabled intentional hand movement through machine-learning-driven muscle stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that when actions are intentional, people perceive them as occurring faster, a phenomenon known as compressed temporal binding. This discovery sheds light on the neural encoding of intention and contributes to the ongoing debate over free will by showing that subjective intention aligns with motor cortex activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporal Binding:&lt;/strong&gt; Intentional actions are perceived to occur sooner than involuntary ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Encoding of Intent:&lt;/strong&gt; Single neurons in the motor cortex reflect the experience of intention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain-Machine Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; The study leveraged implanted electrodes and machine learning to decode and act on motor intentions in real time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers led by Jean-Paul Noel at the University of Minnesota, United States, have decoupled intentions, actions and their effects by manipulating the brain-machine interface that allows a person with otherwise paralyzed arms and legs to squeeze a ball when they want to. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; on April 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, the study reveals temporal binding between intentions and actions, which makes actions seem to happen faster when they are intentional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separating intentions from actions was made possible because of a brain-machine interface. The participant was paralyzed with damage to their C4/C5 vertebrae and had 96 electrodes implanted in the hand region of their motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they tried to squeeze a ball, a machine-learning algorithm looked at all the signals coming to the electrodes, and learned which activity pattern meant “squeeze” (close) and which meant “relax” (open).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once learned, the machine could send an electrical signal to the appropriate hand muscles, allowing the participant to squeeze the ball, which then delivered a sound. On average, the participant perceived the time from intention to action to be 71 ms, which was slightly faster than the real time duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heart of the study involved systematically removing each part of the chain of events. By randomly stimulating the participant’s hand to squeeze the ball, the researchers were able to eliminate intentions. In this case, actions were judged to occur much later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, when the participant tried to squeeze the ball, but actions were prevented by not stimulating the hand, intentions were perceived to happen much earlier if the sound was still played after the machine decoded the intention. Perceived timing did not change if the sound was not played.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results indicated a compressed temporal binding between intention and action. Recordings from the electrodes, which normally cannot be done in humans, showed that the motor cortex encodes these intensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add, “The work builds on a long tradition trying to establish the temporal relationship between moving, the onset of the subjective experience of intending the movement, and the neural correlates of this intention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there have been quite a number of non-invasive studies on this topic, only a single study prior to our was able to measure single neurons – the gold-standard in neuroscience – in humans while asking them to report when they first ‘felt the urge to move’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors continue, “This prior work (Fried et al., 2011) showed that certain brain areas (all in the frontal cortex) know about the intention to move up to a second prior to when we experience that intention. You can imagine this created quite the debate regarding whether humans have free will or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study contributes to this debate by recording single neurons in the primary motor cortex. We show that firing of neurons in this area (the last cortical node before the spinal cord, which ultimately elicits movements) co-occur with the subjective experience of intending a movement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude, “The work would have not been possible without expertise from a number of contributors, including neurosurgeons, neuroengineers and neuroscientists, among others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;AS is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant PP00P3 163951/1; www.snf.ch), OB is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (www.snf.ch) and the Bertarelli Foundation (https://www.fondation-bertarelli.org/).

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study was funded by Cancer Playbook, which works with the Whole House Oncology Institute to collect, analyze and share &lt;a href="https://wholehealthoncology.com/featured" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;data on patient-reported outcomes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While research restrictions on Schedule I substances severely hamper clinical research on cannabis in humans, there is a large body of observational studies on medical cannabis and cancer – as well as lab research – that looks at cannabis’s effect on tumors in test tubes and in animals. The analysis included as many of those studies as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In order to move beyond bias – conscious or not – it was essential to use a large-scale, radically inclusive methodology based on mathematical reasoning,” Castle said, adding: “We wanted to analyze not just a handful, but nearly every major medical cannabis study to find the actual points of scientific agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Castle’s study looked at more than 10,000 studies on cannabis and cancer, which he said is “10 times the sample size of the next largest study, which we believe helps make it a more conclusive review of the scientific consensus”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To analyze the massive quantity of studies, Castle and his team used AI – specifically, the natural language processing technique known as “sentiment analysis”. This technique allowed the researchers to see how many studies had positive, neutral or negative views on cannabis’s ability to treat cancer and its symptoms by, for example, increasing appetite, decreasing inflammation or accelerating “apoptosis”, or the death of cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Castle says his team hoped to find “a moderate consensus” about cannabis’s potential as a cancer treatment, and expected the “best case scenario” to be something like 55% of studies showing that medical cannabis improved cancer outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It wasn’t 55-45, it was 75-25,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study overwhelmingly supported cannabis as a treatment for cancer-related inflammation, appetite loss and nausea. Perhaps more surprisingly, it also showed that cannabis has the potential to fight cancer cells themselves, by killing them and stopping their spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“That’s a shocking degree of consensus in public health research, and certainly more than we were anticipating for a topic as controversial as medical cannabis,” Castle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Medical cannabis is controversial when it comes to cancer. A 2024 meta-analysis published last year in Jama&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that adults with cannabis-use disorder – defined by criteria including an inability to stop or cut down – &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2822269" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;were 3.5-5 times more likely to develop head and neck cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Donald Abrams, an oncologist and professor emeritus of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, says that study was “flawed” in his opinion, “as those patients are so often using tobacco and alcohol, known risk factors for those cancers”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For his part, Abrams has found cannabis to be useful for cancer patients managing symptoms like appetite loss, nausea, pain and anxiety. But he is skeptical of claims that cannabis can actually &lt;em&gt;fight&lt;/em&gt; cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I have been an oncologist in San Francisco for 42 years now where many if not most of my patients have had access to cannabis. If cannabis cures cancer, I have not been able to appreciate that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Still, Abrams admits that “there is elegant pre-clinical evidence from test tubes and animal models that cannabis can affect cancer cells or transplanted tumors” but “as yet those findings have not translated into clinical benefit in people”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Castle, however, believes that the combination of pre-clinical evidence and patient reported outcomes show that cannabis does have cancer-fighting potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33623076/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;small pilot trial&lt;/a&gt; in which 21 patients received either a placebo or a cannabis-based medication in addition to traditional chemotherapy found that those who received the cannabis-based medication survived for longer. Another study of&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30275207/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; 119 cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; found that synthetic CBD helped reduce tumor size and tumor cell circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But to truly prove the efficacy of cannabis and find the best treatment formulation, there would need to be much larger clinical trials in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Castle hopes that his meta-analysis will encourage the US Drug Enforcement Administration to complete the long-stalled process of reclassifying cannabis so it is no longer federally illegal, which could help remove restrictions on clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We are not arguing that the standards for adopting new cancer treatments should be lower. We are arguing that medical cannabis meets or exceeds those standards,” he said, “often to a greater extent than current pharmaceutical treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 12:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNelJXSTZKNnRZeUp4QnFlTzlIZ19fMUQ4VEU3LUgtcnlGNkpfdmdnVlBzTnhvY0Q0MTZnVXBVNUFPYTJWRjdRa1R4UzVaWFYwY0hkb3F4bkp5NTBTWjJhNk8tV3JxOWVKRGZ0WFJhYU5nNTJlT29Wa0t2eThVU2pTNklfRQ</guid></item><item><title>Newton-Wellesley医院一个病房的护士中有6例良性脑肿瘤，引发工人的不安-《波士顿环球报》 | Six cases of benign brain tumors among nurses at one Newton-Wellesley Hospital unit spark uneasiness among workers - The Boston Globe</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNSy12dW9sT1M2bl95MGRVb2I4SG1oak83N3o1aFNoOEJnWW1ZNFlEWWVYYnJYUGtUWGhrYWNIQllVeXYycUFxN3dyYnNvaEdNZWRkQXRBRUlEeTlBOURVaHZ6ME1UdjE3aThHOTkySjN5c0MwQ1M1ZVhZM29ZcG05UHhkSnhKdnBIcnMwZWRR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;On Friday , the state health department’s Division of Radiation Control Program planned to return to &lt;a href="https://www.nwh.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Newton-Wellesley &lt;/a&gt;to review information previously provided by the hospital and to perform some confirmatory measurements, the statement said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Exposure of moderate-to-high doses of ionizing radiation, such as from medical imaging devices, has been linked to a higher risk for benign brain tumors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Disease trackers said more scrutiny is needed by independent experts — individuals who are not affiliated with the hospital or the workers’ union there — to help resolve the issue in a manner all sides will trust. They caution that similar work-based situations have taken months to sort through, and even then, definitive answers are often elusive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Further complicating the issue; the federal agency that typically is called in to investigate such matters, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, &lt;/a&gt;or NIOSH, was &lt;a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/11042025/trump-dismantles-worker-safety-agency-as-temperatures-rise/" target="_blank"&gt;recently gutted&lt;/a&gt; when two-thirds of its staff received lay-off notices from the Trump administration, making a NIOSH investigation into the potential cause of the tumors unlikely in the near future. OSHA does not do the sort of disease-tracking investigation that would pinpoint a potential cause for brain tumors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Joe Markman, spokesman for the &lt;a href="https://www.massnurses.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Massachusetts Nurses Association&lt;/a&gt;, the union that represents about 1,500 nurses at the hospital, said its members have a lot of questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We recognize that nurses and many other people want immediate information about the situation,” he said in a statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This urgency comes from a place of concern for the health of nurses, their families, and patients – an urgency that we share," Markman said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The union late last month sent health questionnaires to its members at the hospital, and asked them to share it with other workers there, as well as nurses who formerly worked there. Markman said they’ve received about 300 completed forms and the union’s team of occupational safety and health nurses is poring through responses. They’re also seeking follow-up medical records to get a clearer picture of the potential scope of the issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The union does not have a timetable for when its investigation might be completed, but Markman said, “We are glad the hospital is continuing to look into this situation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Newton-Wellesley Hospital administrators said they tapped outside environmental experts to help with a wide-ranging investigation that scrutinized water and air quality, as well as radiation levels and cleaning chemicals that workers on the fifth floor may have been exposed to. And, they said, they are continuing to work with state and federal investigators. Newton-Wellesley is part of the Mass General Brigham health system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Our rigorous investigation has not identified any environmental trigger at Newton-Wellesley Hospital that causes brain tumors,” the hospital said in a statement. “We remain confident that our environment is safe for staff, clinicians, and patients.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Six current and former staffers from the fifth floor maternity unit have reported to hospital administrators that they have been diagnosed with benign brain tumors in recent years, hospital officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Among those workers is a nurse who worked there 23 years ago and was diagnosed in 2021. Details about the other brain tumor cases have not been released by the hospital, except that the benign tumors are of three different types, and that the individuals included some who worked there only part-time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At least six other workers from the fifth floor also reported other health problems, hospital officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;About one&lt;a href="https://braintumor.org/brain-tumors/about-brain-tumors/brain-tumor-facts/" target="_blank"&gt; million Americans &lt;/a&gt;are living with a brain tumor, according to the National Brain Tumor Society. Nearly three-quarters of such tumors are benign. The majority of people with brain tumors are women, the society notes, and the median age for a diagnosis is 61, which describes the typical gender and age of nurses in Newton-Wellesley’s maternal unit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Without additional information, no conclusion can be reached: if it is due to chance, or some potential work related exposure,” said &lt;a href="https://cceh.sph.brown.edu/people/tongzhang-zheng" target="_blank"&gt;Tongzhang Zheng&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiology professor in the Brown School of Public Health, who is not involved in the Newton-Wellesley investigation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He said that these types of cases are usually deemed to be unrelated, after a neutral third-party reviews all the potential physical and chemical cancer-causing substances that a distinct group of workers was exposed to over a specific period of time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Although a few chemicals (such as benzene, vinyl chloride, formaldehyde and bisphenol A) have been linked to brain tumor risks, the association for most of them is still uncertain,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Thirty years ago,&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/reports/pdfs/1996-0012-2652.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; an investigation by NIOSH &lt;/a&gt;at Brigham and Women’s Hospital concluded that “major ventilation system deficiencies” could have contributed to poor indoor air quality that was linked to nurses’ respiratory and related health problems. But the investigators noted that by the time they arrived, several years after other reports failed to settle on a single source for the ailments, the hospital had already started to fix the ventilation system, and that complicated the investigators’ findings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Identifying the scores of workers who may have cycled in and out of Newton-Wellesley’s fifth-floor maternity unit over a decade or longer, but who may also have worked at other facilities in the intervening time, would be challenging, said &lt;a href="https://x.com/michaelmina_lab/status/1911792370531582050" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Michael Mina&lt;/a&gt;, a former Harvard professor who consults and advises public health organizations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It could be a [physical or chemical] exposure that happened there years ago... and now that exposure is gone, and that’s why these things are often hard to pin down,” he said. “And was there an overlap when all of these nurses were all there?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While acknowledging how challenging such investigations are, Mina said hospital administrators erred in declaring the hospital risk-free while tests are still ongoing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I would want to take a more cautions approach, saying, ”We don’t know, but everything we have found today suggests there is not an ongoing risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists at the &lt;strong&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/strong&gt; has developed a new &lt;strong&gt;chewing gum&lt;/strong&gt; that could dramatically reduce the transmission of &lt;strong&gt;influenza&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;herpes simplex viruses&lt;/strong&gt;. This surprising innovation could provide a low-cost, accessible solution for managing two of the most common and persistent viral threats. The gum is made from &lt;strong&gt;Lablab purpureus&lt;/strong&gt;, commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;lablab beans&lt;/strong&gt;, and it contains a naturally occurring antiviral protein called &lt;strong&gt;FRIL&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Targeting Viral Load at the Source&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new research was led by &lt;strong&gt;Henry Daniell&lt;/strong&gt;, the W.D. Miller Professor in the Department of Basic &amp;amp; Translational Sciences at Penn’s School of Dental Medicine. The study, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(24)00808-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;published in Molecular Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, builds on the team’s earlier work on a similar antiviral gum aimed at &lt;strong&gt;SARS-CoV-2&lt;/strong&gt;. That formula, which is now in clinical trials, was shown to reduce viral presence in saliva or nasal swabs of COVID-19 patients by over 95 percent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using this model, the researchers created a gum targeting &lt;strong&gt;HSV-1&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;HSV-2&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;H1N1&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;H3N2&lt;/strong&gt;, all of which are &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/dog-kisses-dangerous-owners-needs-to-know/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="76006" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;transmitted primarily through the mouth&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike vaccines that target the immune system, this gum works locally in the &lt;strong&gt;oral cavity&lt;/strong&gt;, a site that plays a central role in transmission for many respiratory and contact-based viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;They found that chewing a two-gram tablet containing &lt;strong&gt;40 milligrams of FRIL&lt;/strong&gt; was enough to reduce viral loads in samples by more than &lt;strong&gt;95 percent&lt;/strong&gt;—a performance consistent with the earlier COVID-19 results. Importantly, the gum was manufactured as a &lt;strong&gt;clinical-grade drug product&lt;/strong&gt;, complying with &lt;strong&gt;FDA&lt;/strong&gt; requirements for drug safety and formulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From Lab to Real-World Application&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daniell emphasized the significance of focusing on the &lt;strong&gt;mouth&lt;/strong&gt; as a primary pathway of transmission. “Low vaccination rates for influenza viruses and the lack of an HSV vaccine underscore the need for a new approach—one that targets reducing viral loads at the sites where transmission occurs,” the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The antiviral action of FRIL was consistent and durable throughout testing. Unlike chemical disinfectants or nasal sprays, the gum allows the protein to &lt;strong&gt;linger in the oral environment&lt;/strong&gt;, creating a barrier that traps virus particles directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Researchers involved in the project include scientists from both Penn Dental Medicine and Finnish institutions such as the &lt;strong&gt;Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke)&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;University of Finland&lt;/strong&gt;, indicating a growing international collaboration around food-based viral interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Expanding Efforts to Combat Bird Flu&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With their earlier success in neutralizing &lt;strong&gt;SARS-CoV-2&lt;/strong&gt; and now influenza and &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/why-you-should-never-kiss-a-baby-a-life-and-death-situation/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="72552" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;herpes viruses&lt;/a&gt;, Daniell and his colleagues are turning their attention to a much larger and fast-spreading threat: &lt;strong&gt;avian flu&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In just the past three months, &lt;strong&gt;over 54 million birds&lt;/strong&gt; across North America have been affected by the &lt;strong&gt;H5N1 virus&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/man-couldnt-pee-pulled-out-parasite/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="86499" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;human infections&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in both the &lt;strong&gt;United States&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Canada&lt;/strong&gt;. The team is exploring the use of lablab bean powder in &lt;strong&gt;bird feed&lt;/strong&gt;, aiming to interrupt virus transmission in poultry and potentially prevent human spillover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting evidence for this application is promising. Previous studies by other researchers have already shown that bean powder containing FRIL can neutralize &lt;strong&gt;H5N1&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;H7N9&lt;/strong&gt;, two strains of influenza A that are responsible for bird flu outbreaks in birds and humans alike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a timely innovation to prevent their infection and transmission,” Daniell said, referring to both human and avian flu viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccine hesitancy and lack of access to medical care are among factors to blame for the south and southwest suburbs’ fewer immunizations compared to other regions, said Dr. Kiran Joshi, interim chief operating officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Southland is really big, right? And so there are all these factors that come into play in terms of, do we have the appropriate number of health care providers and clinics? Do we have the appropriate level of public transportation and opportunities to get from point A to point B? All these things play a role in terms of getting those critical preventative services that we all need,” Joshi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 10% of schools across Illinois reporting vaccination rates below 91%, three are within Alsip Hazelgreen Oak Lawn District 126. However, Superintendent Craig Gwaltney reported incorrect numbers for the district’s early childhood center, which he said was 100% vaccinated, rather than 0% as seen on the state dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been here for 30 years — I know the historical data,” Gwaltney said Wednesday. “We never have a problem with vaccination coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of October, the district reported 85.4% of students at Lane Elementary and 74.5% of students at Stony Creek Elementary were vaccinated against the measles. Gwaltney said those numbers don’t reflect the immunization rates now, which he said are 96.2% at Stony Creek and 97.2% at Lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The up-to-date percentages reflect an increase from last year, as Stony Creek reported 88.2% and Lane reported 86.9% of students immunized during the full 2023-2024 school year. Gwaltney dismissed those rates were “nothing that anybody else hasn’t seen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re fine — it’s not anything alarming to me,” Gwaltney said. “I know our community, and we know what we need to do.”&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Neighboring District 125’s Lawn Manor School had only 81.5% of its students vaccinated this school year, according to the dashboard. Oakwood School in Lemont, Wilkins Elementary School in Justice and Sorrick Elementary School in Palos Hills also dropped below 91% at 90.1%, 86% and 90.3%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two schools within Worth District 127 are considered extremely vulnerable to measles, with Worth Elementary School at 87.2% and Worthwoods Elementary at 87.2%. Arbor Park District 145’s Kimberly Heights School in Tinley Park is 88.5% vaccinated, the dashboard shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farther east, Riverdale Elementary School reported 87.6% of students were vaccinated during the 2024-2025 school year and Washington Elementary reported  89.5%. Both are within Dolton West District 148.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dolton District 149, 86.9% of Berger-Vandenberg Elementary students, 85.9% of Caroline Sibley Elementary School students and 88.7% of Creative Communications Academy students are vaccinated, according to the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arcadia Elementary School showed 90.9% vaccinated and Richton Square School was at 87.9% vaccinated. Both are within Matteson Elementary District 162.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brookwood District 167’s Hickory Bend School reported 88.9% vaccinated and Wagoner Elementary School in Community District 168 reported 89.9% vaccinated. Sandridge School in Lynwood’s District 172 showed 77.6% vaccinated and Steger Primary Center in District 194 was at 87.9% vaccinated, the dashboard showed. Thornton Township High School in District 205 is 88.2% vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The south suburbs see the lowest immunization rates compared to the rest of suburban Cook County, sitting at 96% during the 2023-2024 school year, according to the Cook County Department of Public Health. During the same period, southwest suburban schools were about 96.5% vaccinated, west suburban were 97% vaccinated and north suburban were close to 97.5% vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshi said he encourages parents to check the dashboard to see where their child’s school falls with vaccination coverage. Although schools below 91% are extremely vulnerable, the cutoff for community immunity is 95% vaccinated, and schools with rates below that are at an increased risk of an outbreak, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Looking at that dashboard will arm you with information that you could use to be an advocate for immunization,” Joshi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Will County&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the state health department dashboard, fewer schools in Will County, compared to neighboring Cook County, report vaccination rates below 91%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include Goodings Grove in Homer Elementary District 33C, at 90.7%, Talala Elementary in Crete-Monee District 201-U, at 88.5%, and Fairmont School in Fairmont District 89, at 87.8%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health mandates and guidelines created pushback within District 33C following COVID-19 lockdowns. A group of area parents, organized via social media, &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2021/06/23/group-opposing-mask-mandates-sex-education-changes-protest-at-homer-glen-school-board-meeting/"&gt;protested&lt;/a&gt; mask mandates, and several candidates challenging board members in recent elections also &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2023/03/23/homer-district-33c-candidates-discuss-covid-restrictions-overcrowding-and-sex-education-guidelines/"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; masks and school closures.&lt;/p&gt;

(Alicia Fabbre/for the Daily Southtown)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Portwood, Homer 33C assistant superintendent for human resources,  said district officials have done their part to ensure parents either immunize their children or apply for a religious exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All we can do is make sure that parents are educated,” Portwood said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the district has full compliance with state guidelines, meaning parents who have chosen not to vaccinate their children have filed an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In order to file one of those forms, they have to speak with a doctor and be informed of the risks,” Portwood said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portwood declined to speculate on why Goodings Grove has a higher rate of exemption filings than other schools. He said the district recently saw a suspected case, but it turned out not to be measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Vaccination and communication&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state public health department updated the online dashboard Tuesday with immunization rates from the current school up to October 2024. The move followed a rise in measles cases reported across 25 states, including Indiana and Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of April 10, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=There%20have%20been%207%20outbreaks,285)%20were%20outbreak%2Dassociated."&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 712 measles cases and three deaths, reflecting a sharp increase from 2024, which saw 285 cases. Illinois has not reported any cases of measles yet this year, and all those who have died from the highly contagious disease were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We could prevent all of that if we could get everyone vaccinated,” Joshi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herd immunity for the measles is reached when more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, according to the CDC. Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine is about 97% effective at preventing the disease, while one dose is 93% effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshi said measles is one of the most contagious diseases, with one infected person spreading it to nine out of 10 people nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

(Cynthia Goldsmith/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention via AP)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs and symptoms appear seven to 14 days after contact with the virus and include high fever, coughing, runny nose, watery eyes and a rash. Measles can cause serious health complications, particularly in children below age 5, the CDC states, including pneumonia and encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slow decline in vaccination across Cook County mirrors state and nationwide trends and is largely attributable to misinformation and disinformation that is able to spread quickly online, Joshi said. He said as a practicing doctor, he has seen firsthand how false information becomes embedded in certain patients and affects their health decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s incumbent on us as a health department to address those myths with facts,” Joshi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cook County Public Health Department is working to do exactly that with their Myth Vs. Facts campaign, which aims to address common misconceptions about COVID-19, flu and RSV in a really clear and accessible way, Joshi said. The effort, largely seen via the health department’s social media accounts, launched during the most recent flu season and plans to expand to measles vaccination soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLANO, Texas — A person who tested positive for &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; visited three stores, including a Walmart, in Plano while still infectious, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collin County Health Care Services issued a news release Thursday night saying "an individual who spent time in Collin County" on April 10 and 11 has tested positive for measles. The person visited the three stores while still infectious, officials said:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walmart: 6001 N. Central Expressway, Plano (April 10, time unknown)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ross Dress For Less: 3300 N. Central Expressway, Plano (April 11, 5-10 p.m.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dollar Tree: 2404 K Ave., Plano (April 11, evening)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials warned that if you were at those locations on those dates and times, and you're not vaccinated against measles, then you might be at risk of contracting the virus. Measles can be transmitted person-to-person through the air or contaminated surfaces, officials said, and the virus can remain airborne for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what health officials said you should do:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. If you were at one of the venues on the dates and times listed above and are: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Unvaccinated and pregnant; or &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Immunocompromised (receiving treatment that would result in immune system suppression, or have an immune system disease), It is recommended that you contact your health-care provider immediately to discuss the possible exposure. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Anyone who was at the venues on the dates listed above should monitor themselves for measles symptoms through April 20, 2025. Those symptoms include: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis) &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Koplik’s spots: Small white spots with bluish-white centers found inside the mouth &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• A skin rash made up of large, flat blotches&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. If you develop symptoms of measles: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Stay home and away from others. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case is the &lt;a href="/article/news/health/meales-case-reported-rockwall-county-connected-west-texas-outbreak/287-755a7364-e01d-444a-9ffe-f4d80dad4918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;latest reported instance&lt;/a&gt; of measles in North Texas. It's unclear if the measles case reported by Collin County is tied to the main outbreak of measles in West Texas. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rockwall County Health Authority on Wednesday issued a public health notification informing residents that an adult tested positive for measles last week, the agency said in a press release. The individual recently traveled to West Texas and was at home for most of their infectious period, the county said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Then epidemiologists modelled how, at current rice consumption levels, these arsenic levels could affect people's health. They estimated that the corresponding increases in arsenic levels in rice could contribute approximately 19.3 million more cancer cases in China alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Arsenic in rice could increase as CO2 levels and temperatures continue to rise (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Arsenic in rice could increase as CO2 levels and temperatures continue to rise (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Inorganic arsenic has been shown in more studies than I can throw a stick at to be a carcinogen, to have adverse effects with respect to pulmonary health, with respect to cardiovascular health – it's a long laundry list," says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University in New York, who co-authored the study. "And two metrics of climate change – the increase in CO2 and the increase in temperatures – are resulting in greater amounts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It's worth noting that the researchers' worst-case scenario is beyond the high emissions "business as usual" scenario used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body on climate change. The most dire predictions assume temperatures rise by 2C, and CO2 levels increase by an additional 200 parts per million between 2025 and 2050. But it does provide a snapshot of what may happen to rice crops in the future if carbon emissions are not reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We're not the first ones to look at CO2, we're not the first ones to do temperature – but we're the first ones to put them together in the field. And that's what stunned us," says Ziska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Of course, the study has limitations, aside from the metrics chosen for the 2050 scenario. For one, it assumed that people will continue to consume the same amount of rice per person in 2050 that they were eating in 2021, even though, as countries get wealthier, their rice consumption tends to drop. On the other hand, it also assumed that people would continue to eat far more white rice than brown rice, like they do now. Because of how it is processed, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/risa.70008" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;white rice contains less inorganic arsenic than brown rice&lt;/a&gt; – so a shift in the other direction could make numbers even worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Still, this is "one of the most comprehensive studies" ever done on the topic, says Andrew Meharg, professor at the school of biological sciences at Queen's University Belfast, and a long-time researcher of rice and arsenic, who was not involved in the study.

They recommend first parboiling the rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining. Then add fresh water and cook it on a lower heat to absorb all the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Rice tends to be choked out by weeds. But rice can grow in water, while weeds cannot. "That gives rice a big advantage over weeds, and you don't have to spray, you don't have to hoe," Ziska says. "But there's a downside. The downside is, because it's flooded, there's no oxygen in the soil." In these conditions, anaerobic bacteria in the soil then turn to arsenic as an alternative to oxygen to accept electrons as they respire. These bacteria then facilitate &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/trends/plant-science/fulltext/S1360-1385(04)00173-6" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;reactions with other minerals in the soil&lt;/a&gt; that make the arsenic more bioavailable and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01035.x" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;easier for the rice plants to absorb&lt;/a&gt; through their root systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"When you shift the soil by making it less having less oxygen, arsenic comes into its own," Ziska says. It &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.7b02970" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;changes the microbiome of the soil&lt;/a&gt; in such a way that arsenic-loving bacteria become more prolific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And this is what he and his fellow researchers predict will get worse as temperature and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rise. "This bacteria in the soil is getting more carbon. It's getting warmer. And it's being more active," Ziska says. "It really is a synergistic effect. You're making the little bacteria happier with warm, warmer temperatures, but you're also giving them more carbon, and they just go crazy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ziska and his team found that this effect played out for about 90% of the 28 different types of rice that they grew over their 10-year study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Parboiling rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining can help reduce arsenic levels (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Parboiling rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining can help reduce arsenic levels (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;What worries public health experts is that the more research is done on inorganic arsenic, the worse its effect on humans appears to be. In January 2025, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iris.epa.gov/document/&amp;amp;deid=363892" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the US's Environmental Protection Administration updated their assessment&lt;/a&gt; of inorganic arsenic's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iris.epa.gov/static/pdfs/0278tr.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;"cancer potency factor"&lt;/a&gt;, taking into account all new research on arsenic and disease. Their latest assessment found that "arsenic is a lot more potent of a carcinogen than we previously believed", says Keeve Nachman, professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a co-author of the rice and arsenic study. In particular, there is now good evidence that arsenic not only raises the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://publications.iarc.fr/120" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;risk of skin cancer&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iris.epa.gov/static/pdfs/0278tr.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lung and bladder cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For individuals, the risks are slight. For example, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iris.epa.gov/static/pdfs/0278tr.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the latest EPA review&lt;/a&gt; found that consuming 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day – or 7.8 micrograms for a 60kg person – would raise the risk of developing bladder cancer by about 3% and diabetes by about 1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But across populations, particularly those that eat a lot of rice, these small risks can add up. And, if the predictions made by Ziska and his colleagues turn out to be correct, this could significantly impact disease in populations that depend on rice as a staple over the decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="callout-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fpVHcM"&gt;&lt;section class="sc-88ce25f0-0 hKyLjB"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-88ce25f0-1 fWLEJY"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-88ce25f0-3 KoeIS"&gt;Inorganic arsenic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-88ce25f0-2 fTeQYN"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-88ce25f0-4 jYFeys"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;If everyone consumes 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day, for example, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iris.epa.gov/static/pdfs/0278tr.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the EPA calculates&lt;/a&gt; that – compared to consuming noinorganic arsenic – an additional eight people out of every 10,000 get bladder cancer, an additional 10 out of 10,000 get lung cancer, an additional 110 per 10,000 get ischemic heart disease, and an additional 129 out of 10,000 develop diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, aside from cutting emissions and keeping temperature rise as low as possible, what can be done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Rice is a staple food for billions of people worldwide (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Rice is a staple food for billions of people worldwide (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There also needs to be better monitoring and regulation of arsenic exposures in food, researchers say.

In 2023, the EU set new limits on inorganic arsenic in rice at 0.2mg/kg of rice while China has proposed introducing similar limits. But these recommendations don't take into account the fact that some communities eat far more rice than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There are ways in which to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic, but it will require a fundamental change in management of how rice is currently being grown," Ziska says.

She traced her fingers over her swollen skin and sobbed, placing her face in her hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I hate that I do this to myself,” &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahredzikowski/video/7448382169505975583?_t=ZP-8uZiakZiPF9&amp;amp;_r=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;she said&lt;/a&gt; softly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Redzikowski, 40, was talking to her TikTok followers about a secret she had kept hidden from even her closest friends and family for decades: Since age 12, she has compulsively picked her skin, often to the point that it bleeds and scars. As desperately as she wants to quit, Ms. Redzikowski, who has a mental health condition called dermatillomania, simply cannot stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;She estimates that she spends at least two hours per week scraping at the skin on her face — and her scalp, arms, back, chest and legs. “I’ve spent at least 125 days of my life bent over a mirror,” she said in the video. “And that’s 125 days I’ll never get back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;She wiped her eyes and squirted cleanser onto her palms, massaging it over her face until it started to foam. Then she began the familiar routine of trying to repair the damage she had done. She waved a high-frequency wand over the constellation of lesions on her cheeks, willing them to heal faster. She slathered her face in spot treatments and serums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Still, her skin was angry, bleeding in some places. And she was angry with herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It’s an internal battle, because I do know it’s not my fault, and I’m not wanting to do this,” she said in an interview. “But it is my hand. I did do the damage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;People with dermatillomania or other conditions like it, such as uncontrollable hair pulling or nail biting — which are known as body-focused repetitive behaviors, or BFRBs — can feel a sense of shame so debilitating, they will not admit to the behaviors even in anonymous surveys, medical experts said. After all, it’s their fingers plucking strands of hair, their nails digging into their skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When hit with a headache or fever, people often &lt;a href="https://www.japha.org/article/S1544-3191(22)00079-6/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;reach for over-the-counter painkillers&lt;/a&gt; like acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as their first line of defense.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Used correctly, these drugs can be safe and effective for pain relief. That means following the instructions on the label and the advice of a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"But that's not how we take these medications in real life," says &lt;a href="https://www.trishapasricha.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Trisha Pasricha&lt;/a&gt;, a physician and instructor at Harvard Medical School. Some people take too much pain medication too quickly, misdiagnose an ailment and take the wrong drug, or unknowingly take multiple pain relievers at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pds.4391#:~:text=15%25%20of%20adult%20ibuprofen%20users,more%20than%201%20usage%20occasion" target="_blank"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; published in 2018, for example, found that 15% of over 1,300 survey participants exceeded daily NSAID dosages, and most participants didn't recognize that all the products they were taking were NSAIDs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These behaviors can lead to serious side effects, from bloating and nausea all the way up to heart attack and stroke, Pasricha says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To prevent these risks, the health care professionals we spoke to for this story say it's important to get to know the painkillers in your medicine cabinet. Here are 10 things they wish you knew about these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Acetaminophen is usually the better choice for fevers&lt;/strong&gt;, says University of California San Francisco (UCSF) clinical pharmacist &lt;a href="https://pharmacy.ucsf.edu/candy-tsourounis" target="_blank"&gt;Candy Tsourounis&lt;/a&gt;. Commonly known as Tylenol, it's thought to reduce fever and relieve minor aches and pains by raising your body's pain threshold and regulating your body temperature. It's also gentler on the body than NSAIDs are.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. NSAIDs are generally considered more effective than acetaminophen for pain relief&lt;/strong&gt;, Tsourounis says, especially for inflammatory pain like muscle aches. While acetaminophen is thought to work only on the central nervous system, NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (like Advil or Motrin) or naproxen (like Aleve) work throughout the body to reduce inflammation, pain and fever.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Taking too much acetaminophen at one time or too many doses close together can cause liver damage&lt;/strong&gt;, Tsourounis says. So stick to 3,000 milligrams of the drug at most per day, and don't mix it with alcohol, which is also hard on the liver.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. NSAIDs carry risks to the gut and the heart.&lt;/strong&gt; Common side effects include stomach pain, heartburn and bloating. You can also experience more serious damage like ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding or kidney damage if you take NSAIDs at too high a dose or even just for too long a time period, Pasricha says. And non-aspirin NSAIDs have the potential to raise your blood pressure. Every NSAID has a different max dose, so pay attention to your labels.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. If you're not sure which painkiller to use or how much to take, talk to a pharmacist&lt;/strong&gt;, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/blamoh-twegbe/" target="_blank"&gt;Blamoh Twegbe&lt;/a&gt;, pharmacy manager at UCSF outpatient pharmacy. "Please utilize us. That's what we're here for!" They can help you make an informed decision by asking about your type of pain and chronic conditions and by checking any potential drug interactions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. There's a limit to how much pain NSAIDs can treat&lt;/strong&gt;, Pasricha says. If you take more than the recommended dosage or more than one type of NSAID at once — for example, combining Motrin and Aleve — you're increasing your risk of side effects without getting any additional pain relief. If you feel your over-the-counter (OTC) drugs aren't working, talk to a doctor or pharmacist instead of ignoring the warning label.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-58991" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                If you're regularly taking the same over-the-counter pain medications, talk to your doctor about alternatives that can better address your symptoms.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. If you're habitually reaching for the same OTC pain medication, talk to your health care provider.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, if you're taking naproxen every day of your period every month because of muscle cramps. Pasricha says that pain might signal a larger underlying health&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;problem that could be better treated with prescription medication, lifestyle changes or both.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Beware of accidentally overmedicating with a combination OTC drugs. &lt;/strong&gt;Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are often included in a lot of other sick-day remedies, like migraine medication, allergy pills or all-in-one cold and flu medicines, Twegbe says. So when you're not feeling well, double-check your labels before assuming you need a dose of Tylenol on top of those cold-relief meds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59002" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Alternate between NSAIDs and acetaminophen to manage major pain and reduce side effects. &lt;/strong&gt;If you're suffering from the flu or nursing a new injury and need strong and steady pain relief, switching between acetaminophen and an NSAID like ibuprofen every few hours can be a safe and effective way to help you cope until your symptoms subside, Twegbe says. Just make sure to follow recommended dosages and dosing times for each medication.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Think beyond pills.&lt;/strong&gt;  Because over-the-counter pain relievers are so readily available, people often forget that pills aren't the only option when suffering from minor aches and pains, Pasricha says. Many NSAIDs and other analgesics are available in topical form, like creams or patches, and can offer similar relief without the potential side effects to your gut.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are also nonmedication remedies, like heating pads to ease back pain or exercising in water for arthritis. Talk to your doctor about your alternatives, Pasricha says. "They might even control your pain more reliably than just taking medicine."&lt;/p&gt;

But what if you were told that just 2 minutes of walking—yes, a chill, post-meal kind of walk—could actually help you fight off some serious health issues like diabetes and heart disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today’s fast-paced, work-from-home, always-in-a-rush lifestyle, we rarely move around after meals. We eat and then slump into the couch, scroll endlessly, or get back to our laptops. Over time, this sedentary behavior builds up and silently starts messing with our metabolism, blood sugar, and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s where the magic of mini walks comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting down after a full meal feels like a natural reflex. But here’s the not-so-fun truth: right after you eat, your blood sugar levels spike, especially if your meal was rich in carbs. This spike requires insulin to kick in and shuttle that sugar into your cells. Now, if you're just lounging around post-meal, your muscles aren’t helping out much. They’re inactive, which means your body takes longer to bring those blood sugar levels down. Over time, this constant spike-crash cycle can lead to insulin resistance. That’s a direct ticket to type 2 diabetes. Add to that the extra calories that don't get used and end up being stored as fat, often around your belly—aka the danger zone for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The power of a 2-minute walk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, studies are showing that just 2 minutes of light walking after eating can dramatically reduce your post-meal blood sugar levels. It sounds almost impossible that such a tiny amount of effort can have such a big impact, but science backs it up. One major &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-022-01649-4#Sec35" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in Sports Medicine in 2022 analyzed several trials and concluded that people who took short walks (2 to 5 minutes) after meals had significantly lower blood sugar levels compared to those who just sat around. Even just standing helped a little, but walking was clearly better. When you walk, even casually, your leg and core muscles start contracting and your body starts using up the glucose floating around in your blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking right after meals helps avoid that post-lunch slump. You stay more alert, energetic, and less bloated. And all of this goodness happens in just two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes and heart disease often go hand in hand. When your blood sugar is out of control, it affects your blood vessels, your blood pressure, and your overall cardiovascular health. The more sugar floating around unnecessarily, the more damage to your arteries over time. Leisure walking improves circulation, lowers blood pressure, and reduces triglycerides (those nasty fats in your blood). It also reduces inflammation, which is a key culprit in both heart disease and insulin resistance. Even short walks, when done regularly, can help your heart stay young. You don’t need a treadmill or running shoes. Just your feet and a little commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to make this a habit&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few easy ways to sneak in your 2-minute stroll:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Post-breakfast walk around the house: Instead of heading straight to work mode, pace around your living room while planning your day or replying to texts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After lunch office loop: Walk a lap around your office floor or even just head to the farthest restroom and back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dinner wind-down walk: Take your family or your dog out for a short stroll after dinner. It’s good for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staircase strolls: Just walk up and down a few stairs at a casual pace. You’ll get your steps in and help digestion too&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make it casual. Make it enjoyable. Maybe even call someone during that walk or listen to a short podcast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with 2 minutes within 60 to 90 minutes after a meal, ideally sooner. The earlier you move after eating, the more effective it is in flattening that blood sugar spike. Of course, if you have more time and energy, walking for 10-15 minutes gives even better results. But remember: 2 minutes is still infinitely better than zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world obsessed with high-intensity workouts and 30-day challenges, we often underestimate the power of small, consistent habits. And walking for just 2 minutes after a meal might be one of the most underrated health hacks out there. It doesn’t feel like much. It might even feel silly at first. But over time, it adds up to lower blood sugar, better heart health, more energy, and possibly even weight loss. So here’s your reminder: the next time you eat, don’t just sit there. Walk a little. Let your body do its thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;20 mins of extra walking every day slashes cardiovascular disease risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，这种食物可以保护您的肠道免受炎症- AOL.com | This Food Could Protect Your Gut from Inflammation, New Study Suggests - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE9PY1dqR3JfaFY0a1B0alRyVWRDR2trNHJIMDQtbFREQU50b3dPV1ZfNnlMNG5XVE5oNkprWldiR1EwajAxYWdtU3NRZGt0UEVRdkprRjlZUk1icUxVSUh6UXlLMThKTWRianhteEhFQ2RPMmpQa0FVMWRn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewed by Dietitian Annie Nguyen, M.A., RD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design elements: Getty Images.

It influences &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:almost every system in your body;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;almost every system in your body&lt;/a&gt;, including your brain, heart and, of course, your digestive system. Your gut’s microbiome contains living organisms, including bacteria and yeast, that affect your health—hopefully in positive ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what you eat greatly influences what your microbiome is made up of. Eating fermented foods, like yogurt, kefir and sauerkraut, can help you add beneficial probiotics. Then there’s prebiotics, which are food for those probiotics to feast on, and they’re primarily found in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and whole grains. Some foods play a dual role as both prebiotic and probiotic. For example, kimchi and sauerkraut are fermented, providing probiotics. And because they’re made from cabbage, they also provide food for that beneficial bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these beneficial bacteria eat, they produce metabolites. A metabolite is a compound formed in or necessary for metabolism, which means it helps you keep your energy up and maintain your overall health. Metabolites can also help get rid of toxic substances in the body. There is some evidence that certain microorganisms produce metabolites that specifically help maintain a healthy intestinal wall, which is also sometimes called an intestinal barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health of your intestinal wall is important, as the intestinal wall should only allow certain compounds to pass through it. A healthy intestinal wall is made up of healthy cells that are properly joined together. An unhealthy intestinal wall has large gaps between cells, potentially allowing toxins to enter the body. That’s called intestinal hyperpermeability or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-of-leaky-gut-syndrome-8421526" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:leaky gut syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;leaky gut syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, and it can have some negative health consequences, including achy joints, fatigue, depression, anxiety, food allergies and autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because both cabbage and sauerkraut have health benefits, researchers at the University of California, Davis, wanted to examine the difference in metabolites between the two. Specifically, researchers were testing whether sauerkraut’s and cabbage’s metabolites could help protect intestinal cells from inflammation-related damage. Their findings were published in April 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Applied Environmental Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break down what they found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/i-tried-eating-the-doctor-recommended-30-plant-based-foods-a-week-8763777" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I Tried Eating the Doctor-Recommended 30 Plant-Based Foods a Week—Here’s How It Went;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;I Tried Eating the Doctor-Recommended 30 Plant-Based Foods a Week—Here’s How It Went&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Was This Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined the metabolites in two types of sauerkraut, the brine from the sauerkraut and raw cabbage. The two types of sauerkraut included store-bought and homemade sauerkrauts. The homemade sauerkraut was examined at varying times throughout the fermentation process to see if their metabolites changed at different times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a study is done in a lab setting, researchers attempt to mimic the human body for studies that are trying to connect factors with how they react in humans—referred to as &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. In this case, the intestinal environment was imitated in the lab by using cells from the intestinal wall and exposing them to inflammatory compounds plus the metabolites produced from sauerkraut, cabbage and brine samples. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-protein-for-better-gut-health-11683975" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The #1 Protein for Better Gut Health, Recommended by Gastroenterologists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The #1 Protein for Better Gut Health, Recommended by Gastroenterologists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Did This Study Show?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that all sauerkraut samples—store-bought and homemade—helped protect the intestinal cells from inflammation. The sauerkraut brine and raw cabbage did not have these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing store-bought sauerkraut to homemade, researchers found no difference with the result of maintaining the integrity of the intestinal cells, despite having some differing metabolites. Despite the differences, researchers note that there are “core metabolites” shared by both types of sauerkraut that protect your intestines from inflammatory damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all studies, this one also has some limitations, the primary one being that it was performed in a lab, not in humans. Until this same concept is tested in human participants, we cannot say with certainty that the results directly apply to humans. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-sauerkraut-good-for-you-8729233" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What Happens to Your Body When You Eat Sauerkraut Regularly;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What Happens to Your Body When You Eat Sauerkraut Regularly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; study suggests that homemade and store-bought sauerkraut may protect the intestinal wall from inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the store-bought sauerkraut used in this study was from the refrigerated section of the grocery store, which means that it maintains its probiotics. Shelf-stable canned and jarred sauerkraut has been heated to high temperatures and in that process, it loses most of its probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, now you find yourself standing in front of the refrigerated section of the grocery store, and you notice that there are several brands to choose from. Is one better than the others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the enrichment of the mostly beneficial compounds was consistent across sauerkraut ferments,” says &lt;a href="https://marcolab.ucdavis.edu/people/maria-marco" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Maria Marco, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Maria Marco, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the study’s lead author. “This finding is useful because it suggests that, so long as the fermented cabbage is made correctly, we don’t need to rely on a single commercial brand to get a benefit from eating that type of food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fermented-foods-for-brain-health-8729105" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The 6 Best Fermented Foods for Brain Health, According to Dietitians;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The 6 Best Fermented Foods for Brain Health, According to Dietitians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Marco says “made correctly,” she refers to the sauerkraut not being heated.

When buying sauerkraut, the ingredients should be basic—cabbage and salt, possibly with a seasoning added, like caraway seeds or garlic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to start adding sauerkraut on a regular basis but aren’t accustomed to it, begin with small amounts—like a tablespoon with a meal every day or so—and gradually increase it according to your body’s tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a sauerkraut fan? Other fermented foods, like yogurt and kefir, will also add beneficial bacteria to your gut. When your microbiome is balanced with plenty of beneficial bacteria, it reduces inflammation. An imbalanced microbiome has been linked with higher levels of inflammation, which can lead to chronic illness, including leaky gut syndrome. There is evidence that, besides the symptoms we previously mentioned, leaky gut &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gut-health-and-diabetes-8584301" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:has also been linked to type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;has also been linked to type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. That means taking care of your gut has the potential to lead for better overall health—especially since &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gut-healthy foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gut-healthy foods&lt;/a&gt; tend to be &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-eat-every-week-for-a-healthy-gut-8696826" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pretty good for you;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pretty good for you&lt;/a&gt; in other ways, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-anti-inflammatory-meal-plan-for-leaky-gut-8637811" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:7-Day Anti-Inflammatory Meal Plan for Leaky Gut, Created by a Dietitian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;7-Day Anti-Inflammatory Meal Plan for Leaky Gut, Created by a Dietitian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study affirms how fermentation dramatically changes the bioactive composition of our foods and beverages and how these changes may impact our digestive tract,” says Marco. “Although more studies need to be done, a picture is forming that we find health benefits from fermented foods [that are] not observed from consuming the raw or cooked ingredients these foods are made from.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-cabbage-8557536" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:raw or cooked cabbage;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;raw or cooked cabbage&lt;/a&gt; isn’t good for you, though. “It’s important to point out that we still have many questions as to the best format—like cooked or fresh—and quantities of these foods we should be eating, and how different people respond to them. However, fermented foods are good to include as a part of a healthy diet,” concludes Marco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you want to make some gut-conscious choices on your next grocery run, reach for dependable fermented foods like yogurt, sauerkraut and kefir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fermented-foods-for-better-gut-health-8675613" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Best Fermented Foods for Better Gut Health, According to a Gastroenterologist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Best Fermented Foods for Better Gut Health, According to a Gastroenterologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sauerkraut-gut-inflammation-study-11717425" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 07:18:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9PY1dqR3JfaFY0a1B0alRyVWRDR2trNHJIMDQtbFREQU50b3dPV1ZfNnlMNG5XVE5oNkprWldiR1EwajAxYWdtU3NRZGt0UEVRdkprRjlZUk1icUxVSUh6UXlLMThKTWRianhteEhFQ2RPMmpQa0FVMWRn</guid></item><item><title>麻疹患者在西雅图塔科马机场，塔克维拉酒店-西雅图时报 | Person with measles was at Sea-Tac Airport, Tukwila hotel -

Some people will probably build up to between 5-8kg [11-18lbs], but it’s important that at every weight, the only thing moving is the arm in the row movement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hooten suggests aiming for 30 seconds of work on each arm, resting briefly for 15-20 seconds between arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-is-building-core-strength-important-for-your-back"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why is building core strength important for your back?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hooton explains that there's no single cause of back pain, but sitting too much can weaken your abdominal muscles and create stiffness in your back. Rebuilding your core might reverse this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the core muscles are working effectively together to support the spine, this can stop excessive strain to supporting structures and resolve back pain," adds Hooton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Restoring optimal functioning of core muscles often involves a combination of stretching tight and restricted muscles.

Now in its fifth year, the program has expanded to cover most of the city's parks, which span over 1,600 acres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of more dandelions in grass, tree wells, and open play areas is a sign of the program's success. These plants are nontoxic to both people and pets, ensuring that the parks remain safe for visitors to enjoy. Additionally, dandelions play a crucial role in supporting local pollinators, contributing to the ecological health of the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the program go to the City of Boise's &lt;a href="https://www.cityofboise.org/departments/parks-and-recreation/pesticide-reduction-program/" target="_blank" title="https://www.cityofboise.org/departments/parks-and-recreation/pesticide-reduction-program/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KBOI</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 03:36:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxQVF9pS2pCSFY2TEZ0czhFLVdxbm5PUHdtZmNYV20wZXF0eEVQU2pkcHdzUjB0Y25EbEI3bkgwdEw5Wjh3OHQ0SmpEWlZjNFJUb2J2YXBRLS1fMDlncWxYSWdPdlg5M3FPN0c3MGZsaURoSHQ1eWV5Zk9Sak5wNG80RXJpVDBnZXVOTE5PcHNVQTBlYjYzdUt2TXBxMFFzQmIwSHl6MWpTbnowZWxOb0NDam5ZY2hSZHRFUEZtQkd3</guid></item><item><title>夏威夷第二例麻疹病例在家庭成员中得到确认- Honolulu Star-Advertiser | Hawaii’s 2nd measles case confirmed in household member - Honolulu Star-Advertiser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxNT1VqLVZ1M3dSNFRIWll3MWcyQ2dBaF9sa1NCeGhMeEdjSHQ5U05ZTzlNS3I2VzJpRWJMcGN6dzFJU0N3eEQ5RFZTYXlXTmEtc2RNZ1FpV2VmMmxINzlfYk9tODFIRHdOSThIblJicEZyRmZRVnk5S2t6RGZzZFg2UThzYndubGphRTlWTEpWVGVmNGZzWnFsQWVqaEd3T196U3Z1OWhwSFNPZUlLYm1NVw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-content" class="post col-12 col-md-11 clearfix"&gt;
                                &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health today confirmed a second case of measles in an adult household member of the first case, which was in a &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/08/breaking-news/hawaii-confirms-travel-related-measles-case-in-child-under-5/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;child &lt;/a&gt;under the age of 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second case was considered a presumptive case after the adult began exhibiting symptoms. The child confirmed to have measles on April 7 has since &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/14/breaking-news/oahu-child-with-measles-recovers-92-people-identified-for-possible-exposure/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;fully &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/14/breaking-news/oahu-child-with-measles-recovers-92-people-identified-for-possible-exposure/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;recovered&lt;/a&gt;. Both recently returned from international travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As expected, on April 16, the test result confirmed measles infection,” said DOH in a news release. “Because of the duration between symptom onset and test specimen collection, an antibody test was performed which takes longer to process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said it has already investigated others who may have been exposed, based on this being a presumed case of measles. The adult is no longer contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through contact-tracing efforts, health officials have also identified dozens of individuals exposed to one or both cases at various Oahu locations, and asked 10, which had not been vaccinated or shown immunity against measles, to isolate at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, DOH said no new suspected measles cases have been reported, and that it continues to reach out to those who have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Measles&lt;/a&gt;, a highly contagious viral illness, is spread through direct contact with an infected person or through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An infected person can spread measles to others from four days before developing a rash through four days afterward. The virus can remain in the air up to two hours after an infected person has left the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccination is the best way to protect loved ones and prevent an outbreak,” said DOH. “If you or your ohana have not been vaccinated or otherwise have immunity against measles, please talk with your healthcare provider about getting a dose of the (measles, mumps, rubella) MMR vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — Members of a NASA safety panel said they were “deeply concerned” about the safety of the aging International Space Station, citing long-running issues and funding shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a public meeting of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) April 17, members expressed concerns about growing risks as the station nears its projected end in 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence,” said Rich Williams, a member of the panel, arguing there were “increasing risks” to the station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of those risks are problems the station has been facing for years, such as leaks in a vestibule of the station’s Zvezda module called PrK. Russian and American experts have been investigating small cracks seen in PrK for several years, &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/nasa-and-roscosmos-disagree-on-cause-and-severity-of-iss-air-leak/"&gt;with no resolution on their cause or how to best address them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams said officials from NASA and Roscosmos are scheduled to meet later this month in Moscow to update efforts to mitigate risks on the cracking. In the meantime, he said ISS managers have implemented procedures such as limiting repressurization of the vestibule, which links a docking port to the rest of the station. “The panel has considered this one of our highest concerns,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another concern is developing deorbit plans for the ISS, particularly in an emergency before its scheduled retirement at the end of the decade before the arrival of the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle (USDV) that NASA has contracted SpaceX to build. “If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the USDV is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude,” Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The station is dealing with several other issues, such as keeping sufficient spare parts for life support systems and delays with cargo resupply vehicles. That latter concern involves both the delays in the first flight of Sierra Space’s Dream Chaser vehicle, now expected no earlier than late summer. and Northrop Grumman scrapping its NG-22 Cygnus mission to the ISS, which was scheduled to launch in June, &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/cygnus-mission-to-iss-scrapped-after-finding-spacecraft-damage/"&gt;because of damage to the spacecraft incurred during shipping&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overarching all of these risks is a large ISS budget shortfall,” Williams said. “All of these risks are actually a derivative of this budget shortfall and collectively contribute to potential compromise of the low Earth orbit transition plan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not elaborate on the nature of the budget shortfall ASAP perceives in ISS operations. In the agency’s fiscal year 2024 operating plan, NASA allocated $993 million to ISS operations and maintenance, with more than $1.63 billion to crew and cargo transportation. In 2023, NASA spent $1.03 billion on ISS operations and maintenance and $1.64 billion on crew and cargo transportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASAP, in its 2024 annual report, warned that ISS operations could face budget pressures from the costs of building the USDV and funding needed for supporting commercial space stations. “The Panel has grave concerns, however, that if the necessary funds for both the USDV and the supporting launch infrastructure (over $1B in total) comes solely from the existing ISS budget, this will unduly strain NASA’s ability to safely perform normal and contingency ISS on-orbit operations,” it stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As programs near final phases, it is tempting to assume less resources will need to be available,” Williams said. “For the ISS, it is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle is safely reentered.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The panel appreciates the demonstrated operational excellence of the ISS program, but remains deeply concerned about the increasing and cascading risk attending the program over the next several years,” he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

He’s made friends at the gym, but wishes that their generation were more connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I often reflect that I see people in the gym more than I see my mum or any family member, but you don’t say hello to them. You just walk past them awkwardly.

One of my favourite periods of time is, for example, the French Revolution. And a lot of those ideas were formed by young people going in pubs and discussing ideas.

		&lt;p&gt;Montana public health officials have identified five cases of measles in Gallatin County, the first confirmed instances of the infectious disease in the state since 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Thursday evening press release, the state Department of Public Health and Human Services said the individuals — children and adults — are isolating at home in Gallatin County. All are unvaccinated or their vaccine status is not known, the release said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;County health officials are working to establish who else may have been exposed to the disease in recent days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The [Gallatin City County Health Department] continues to assess any potential exposures while the individuals were contagious and are contacting the people who may have been exposed. People potentially exposed are being provided with information about the exposure date and disease symptoms to watch out for,” the state press release said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its website, Gallatin County health officials listed &lt;a href="https://www.healthygallatin.org/community-health/communicable-diseases/measles/"&gt;two locations&lt;/a&gt; where members of the public could have been exposed to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interwest Tire on Jackrabbit Lane in Belgrade on Monday, April 14, between 12  p.m. and 4 p.m. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;North Coast Electric in Bozeman on Shedhorn Drive on Friday, April 11, between 7:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement makes Montana one of 26 nationwide jurisdictions with measles cases, according to the most recent information from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. As of April 10, the federal agency had confirmed 712 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montana officials said the infected people were exposed to the disease while traveling out of state, but did not say where. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of nationwide cases, 97%, have affected people who are not vaccinated against measles, according to the CDC. About 70% of cases have occurred among those 19 years old and younger. Two children have died from the disease during the ongoing outbreak. A third death is under investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its Thursday press release, the state health department said that people “without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles virus has an average incubation period of 14 days. Infectious particles can hang in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours after someone leaves the area. A person carrying the virus can spread it to others days before they begin showing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State officials described early measles symptoms as including “fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth, and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure.” Infants under 12 months of age, who are typically not recommended to get either of the two-dose MMR vaccine series, are particularly at risk of infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the long-term health consequences from measles can include brain swelling, seizures, hearing loss, pneumonia, miscarriage and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state health department said that a high level of vaccination at the community level helps protect infants and others who cannot be vaccinated from disease. The release did not state Gallatin County’s vaccination rate against measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While it is unfortunate to have cases of measles after 35 years of disease inactivity in Montana, we have been working diligently with our local partners to prepare,” said Dr. Maggie Cook-Shimanek, the state health department’s public health physician, in the Thursday announcement. “We are confident that our public health and clinical partners will work together and address this situation as quickly as possible. It is important for everyone to know their vaccination status and to visit with their health department or health care provider if they are unsure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montana legislation backed by Republican lawmakers in 2021 &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/montana-immunization-vaccines-measles-data-collection-schools-legislature/"&gt;stripped a requirement from state law&lt;/a&gt; that required state officials to collect aggregated vaccination and exemption data from school districts and child care centers, creating a statewide information void about local vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bill to reverse that decision, &lt;a href="https://projects.montanafreepress.org/capitol-tracker-2025/bills/hb-364/"&gt;House Bill 364&lt;/a&gt;, has &lt;a href="https://bills.legmt.gov/#/laws/bill/2/LC2892?open_tab=status"&gt;stalled&lt;/a&gt; in the state Legislature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-light-gray-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-newspack-blocks-homepage-articles  wpnbha ts-2  has-text-align-left"&gt;

This last one was a kind of fix-it job from the guy that did it before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I looked like Quasimodo, because I had one eye here, one eye there.

One day I said, "Do you think I should put Botox in my face?" And [Dr. Rosenberg] looked at me and he goes, "I thought this day would never come," the mother-of-three recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And I was like "Oh my God, I needed Botox"…there's a sweet spot.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the mother-of-three insisted that her Botox use is 'super minimal' and that she only has it injected in a few areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm a minimalist…I do the crow's feet and I do the neck and that's it. I do it now three times a year.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kelly is also a huge skincare advocate and often uses topical products to help minimise signs of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another instance, fifty-nine year old Brooke Shields is another A-lister whose feet show regular signs of ageing whereas her face has maintained a breathtaking signature youthful glow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in 2023, the star explained that while she got &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/botox/index.html" id="mol-aec26860-7a51-11ee-8322-4f7f58a6d4aa"&gt;Botox&lt;/a&gt; in the past, she's decided to embrace her natural beauty as she ages because she's 'scared' of 'over doing it' and ending up 'not looking like herself.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The actress and model opened up about why she's not interested in getting plastic surgery during a chat with &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.glamour.com/story/brooke-shields-glamour-women-of-the-year-2023"&gt;Glamour &lt;/a&gt;magazine for its US Woman of the Year issue, explaining that she 'doesn't want to chase youth,' but instead, 'chase the now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said that while she's not against women going under the knife if they're doing it 'for the right reasons,' it's not for her personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while she's 'seen it give women such confidence,' she admitted that it did just the opposite for her when she received Botox injections in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am all for any of it if it truly is done for yourself, for the right reasons, and gives you a level of some kind of confidence that you need,' said the Blue Lagoon alum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Listen, I’ve seen it give women such confidence. But I think it’s easy to go down the slope of overdoing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’m scared of not looking like myself. The times that I’ve had Botox, I end up with this Spock eye and I’m like, "I don’t look like myself."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Brooke is not a fan of injectables or surgery, she said she does love to 'try the newest' skin regimens, like Fraxel - a 'non-invasive' laser treatment 'for people who want to look younger without dramatic changes,' according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'll get Fraxels and peels, or whatever the newest thing is, I’ll try it. I just don’t want to not look like myself,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There’s more and more plastic surgery than ever. Because [people are] chasing youth. I don’t want to chase youth. I want to chase now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brooke has long been open about her fears over plastic surgery and has continuously insisted that she's never gone under the knife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Back in 2019, when asked by host Andy Cohen if she had gotten any surgical procedures during an episode of Watch What Happens Live, Brooke said, 'No, I have not done a thing to my face.

That’s because high cholesterol can be caused by different things, including your genes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"High cholesterol is very common, but most people don't know they have it because it doesn't usually have any symptoms. That's why everyone should have a &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/cholesterol/getting-a-cholesterol-test" rel="nofollow"&gt;cholesterol check.&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heart UK explains when you have too much cholesterol it damages your arteries. It says: "Fatty areas known as plaques can form, and these become harder with time, making the arteries stiffer and narrower. This process is called atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"When the arteries become narrower, it’s harder for blood to flow through them. This puts a strain on your heart because it has to work harder to pump blood around your body. Eventually, the heart can become weak and can’t work as well as it should.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Blood clots can form over the fatty, hardened parts of the arteries (plaques). The blood clots can block the artery completely, cutting off the blood flow. Bits of the blood clots can break away and become lodged in an artery or vein in another part of the body, which can cause a heart attack or stroke."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But experts at Heart UK say there are things you can do to both cut your cholesterol levels now if they are already high - or reduce the chance of getting them in the future. &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/healthy-living/cholesterol-lowering-foods" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;It has drawn up a list of foods&lt;/a&gt; that can help cut high cholesterol - and set out exactly how much you should have of each every day to get the best benefit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It says: "There are several foods which are not just part of a healthy diet, they can actively help to lower your cholesterol too. Try to eat some of these every day as part of your healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "The more you add them to what you eat, the more they can help lower your cholesterol, especially if you cut down on &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/saturated-fat" rel="nofollow"&gt;saturated fa&lt;/a&gt; t as well." This is what they recommend: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Foods rich in unsaturated fats&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cut down on &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/saturated-fat" rel="nofollow"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; and replace it with unsaturated fats is great way to lower your cholesterol, says the charity. Foods which contain &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/fats-and-oils#unsaturated-fats" rel="nofollow"&gt;unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; include: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;vegetable oils such as olive, sunflower, corn, rapeseed, nut and seed oils&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;avocado, nuts and seeds&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fat spreads made from vegetable oils, such as sunflower and olive oil&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;oily fish&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim to eat two portions of fish per week, at least one of which should be oily.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The experts say: "Oily fish are a good source of healthy unsaturated fats, specifically a type called &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/fats-and-oils#unsaturated-fats" rel="nofollow"&gt;omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A portion is 140g, but you could have two or three smaller portions throughout the week. Tinned, frozen or fresh all count e.g. salmon, sardines, pilchards, trout, herring and mackerel."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it warns to avoid coconut and palm oil as, unlike other vegetable oils, they are high in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fruit and vegetables&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fruit and vegetables&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fruits and vegetables can help reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke and some cancers. The experts explain: "They contain vitamins, minerals and plant chemicals which help you to stay healthy, and most contain little or no fat and are low in calories, so they can help you to stay a healthy weight. And, if you are eating more fruit and veg, chances are you're eating less of the other more energy-packed foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Fruit and vegetables are also high in fibre, and some types of fibre can help to lower your cholesterol. It blocks some cholesterol from being absorbed from the intestines into the blood stream."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good choices include pulses such as beans, peas and lentils as they are particularly high in this kind of fibre. Others include sweet potato, aubergine, okra (ladies’ fingers), broccoli, apples, strawberries and prunes are also good options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fruits and vegetables can be fresh, tinned, frozen or dried. however if you opt for tinned choose those in juice or water, without added sugar or salt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However some fruit and vegetables are not included when it comes to getting your five-a-day. Potatoes, yams, cassava and plantains count as a starchy food, like rice or pasta.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;while unsweetened fruit juice and smoothies are included but count only as one portion. The charity says: "More than one doesn’t count because the loose sugar and acid in them can damage your teeth."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;b&gt;You should aim for at least five portions of fruit and veg a day.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An adult portion is around 80g, or a handful. Make at least one of these beans, peas or lentils. Other options include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;3 tablespoons of vegetables – such as sweet potato, broccoli or okra&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; 3 tablespoons of beans, peas or lentils – all options count, for example chickpeas, kidney beans, garden peas and red lentils &lt;br&gt; 2-3 cauliflower or broccoli florets &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; half a large vegetable – such as courgette, pepper or aubergine &lt;br&gt; half an avocado &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a medium sized vegetable – such as a turnip, parsnip, sweet potato, leek, tomato or carrot&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;a medium sized fruit – for example, an apple, orange or banana&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;2 small fruits – such as plums or satsumas&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a handful of berries or grapes – and other small fruits like strawberries and prunes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a good-sized slice of a larger fruit – such as a melon, mango or pineapple&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a tablespoon of dried fruit&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a 150ml glass of fruit juice&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a bowl of salad&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Foods with added sterols and stanols&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sterols and stanols are plant chemicals which are a similar size and shape to cholesterol. Heart UK explains how they work saying: "They are absorbed from the intestines into the blood stream and block some cholesterol from being absorbed, lowering the cholesterol in your blood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We get a small amount of sterols from plant-based foods such as vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, but it’s not enough to lower cholesterol. So, food companies have developed foods with plant sterols or stanols added to them, such as mini yogurt drinks, fat spreads, milk and yogurts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"These fortified foods lower your cholesterol gradually, over a few weeks, and how much depends on the amount you eat. Some experts believe they are the most effective single food for lowering cholesterol."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While both sterols and stanols have been thoroughly researched, so they can be added to foods and are safe to eat some people cannot have them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;They are suitable for:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;People with high cholesterol – there’s no real benefit if you don’t have high cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Children with inherited high cholesterol such as familial hypercholesterolaemia – with support from a doctor or dietitian.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;People taking statins – sterols and stanols will help to lower your cholesterol further because they work in a different way to the statin.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;They are not suitable for:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Women who are pregnant or breast feeding.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Children who do not have an inherited condition.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;They won’t have much effect if you are taking Ezetrol (Ezetimibe) because they both work in a similar way.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim for: one to three servings of fortified foods a day - you can get this by either:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;three servings of 2tsp fat spread&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;one 115g yoghurt&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;one fortified yoghurt mini-drink&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This will give you 1.5 to 3g of stanols and sterols.&lt;/span&gt; Over three weeks, this could lower your cholesterol by up to 10%. There’s no extra benefit to having more than 3g a day. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health UK advises: "To get the most from these foods, eat some every day and eat them with a meal rather than on their own. Look out for products labelled ‘fortified with stanols or sterols’. They can be branded, such as the Flora ProActiv and Benecol ranges, as well as supermarket own products."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;b&gt;Oats and barley&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oats and barley are grains which are rich in a type of fibre called beta glucan. The experts say: "Eating 3g of beta-glucan a day as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle can help to lower cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"When you eat beta glucan, it forms a gel which binds to cholesterol-rich bile acids in the intestines. This helps limit the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed from the gut into your blood. Your liver then has to take more cholesterol out of your blood to make more bile, which lowers your blood cholesterol."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim for: three servings of the following oat-based products or barley per day to give you about 3g of beta glucans.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;a bowl of porridge – which is 30g of dry oats or a sachet of instant porridge&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a bowl of oat-based breakfast cereal flakes – around 30-35g&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;250 ml of Oat Drink containing beta-glucans (not all oat drinks contain beta-glucan so check to make sure)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;1 breakfast cereal oat type ‘biscuit’&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;1-2 tbsp (13g) oatbran – try sprinkling it onto cereals or adding it to casseroles, stews, soups and smoothies&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;3 oatcakes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;30g oats added to recipes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;75g cooked pearl barley – try adding it to stews, casseroles and soups&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The charity added: "Many products now contain oats, which makes it easier to get your two to four servings. Foods which have a claim on the label saying they lower cholesterol will contain 1g or more of beta glucan."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Nuts&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nuts are a good source of &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/fats-and-oils#unsaturated-fats" rel="nofollow"&gt;unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; and are lower in &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/saturated-fat" rel="nofollow"&gt;saturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, a mix which can help to keep your cholesterol in check. Heart UK says: "They contain fibre which can help block some cholesterol being absorbed into the blood stream from the gut, as well as protein, vitamin E, magnesium, potassium, natural plant &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/healthy-living/cholesterol-lowering-foods#sterolsandstanols" rel="nofollow"&gt;sterols&lt;/a&gt; and other plant nutrients which help keep your body healthy. They’re also filling, so you’re less likely to snack on other things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim for: 28-30g of nuts a day, which is around a handful.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It adds: "All nuts count. Choose a variety and eat them instead of your normal snack or as part of a meal. Where possible, go for the kind with their skins still intact as they contain more nutrients."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good options are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;almonds&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;macadamias&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;brazil nuts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;cashew nuts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;hazelnuts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;pistachios&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;walnuts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;peanuts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;pecans&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Soya foods&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soya beans and the foods that are made from them are perfect for a heart-healthy diet, advises Heart UK. "They’re full of protein, vitamins and minerals, and they're low in saturated fat. Soya products are a good option for replacing foods which are high in saturated fat such as meat, full fat cream and dairy products, and snacks such as crisps."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim for: around two to three servings of soya a foods day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One serving is:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;a large glass (250ml) of soya milk&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;150g plain soya alternative to yogurt&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;150g Greek-style soya alternative to yogurt&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;100g soya mince&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a handful of soya nuts (35g) – also known as roasted edamame beans, you’ll find them in the nuts and snacks section&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;edamame beans, about 120g – you’ll find them in the frozen foods section&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;100g tofu – silken or firm&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPVWMzNUdGOVgwSEJOT2dGR1lnb2g2U2lsU1c1ZFdERWVWOVJ1cjc3b2dKM0xSR05TM1NZNnlyQ21QZFNGZHRHaGw0UGVTMExoUTU5ajhxUER0WEF0TnRGQTZmb2d2OXdxRjRJdEFSRTNTOUhrWHdCamdMMktpT0xxT9IBhgFBVV95cUxQS25RclFYZVlTTW5GeGFMTHZtZlctcERyVzJwTUFwLTJMOHdSNGw2Z1JMRWROVGRQdW9ybHZxcEdmbkxpQ2R0NXRNcE9ibXJELUt3cUdVNHppcGhRdFRHRXhpamlkbnFQRUdRVUwyNEduaTF5SWZoeUoxTDBtcEFSeW5FZHRVQQ</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家说，通过每天吃六种食物来降低高胆固醇- Surrey Live | Heart expert says cut high cholesterol by eating six foods every day - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPVWMzNUdGOVgwSEJOT2dGR1lnb2g2U2lsU1c1ZFdERWVWOVJ1cjc3b2dKM0xSR05TM1NZNnlyQ21QZFNGZHRHaGw0UGVTMExoUTU5ajhxUER0WEF0TnRGQTZmb2d2OXdxRjRJdEFSRTNTOUhrWHdCamdMMktpT0xxTw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While cholesterol is vital in our blood to stay healthy too much can lead to serious health problems - some potentially fatal. &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; figures show around 59% of people have raised cholesterol levels putting them at &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/high-cholesterol/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;higher risk of heart problems or having a stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to cholesterol charity Heart UK too much cholesterol in your blood can be laid down in the walls of your arteries – the large blood vessels that carry blood around your body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It advises: "Anyone can have high cholesterol, even if you are young, slim, eat well and exercise. That’s because high cholesterol can be caused by different things, including your genes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"High cholesterol is very common, but most people don't know they have it because it doesn't usually have any symptoms. That's why everyone should have a &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/cholesterol/getting-a-cholesterol-test" rel="nofollow"&gt;cholesterol check.&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heart UK explains when you have too much cholesterol it damages your arteries. It says: "Fatty areas known as plaques can form, and these become harder with time, making the arteries stiffer and narrower. This process is called atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"When the arteries become narrower, it’s harder for blood to flow through them. This puts a strain on your heart because it has to work harder to pump blood around your body. Eventually, the heart can become weak and can’t work as well as it should.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Blood clots can form over the fatty, hardened parts of the arteries (plaques). The blood clots can block the artery completely, cutting off the blood flow. Bits of the blood clots can break away and become lodged in an artery or vein in another part of the body, which can cause a heart attack or stroke."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But experts at Heart UK say there are things you can do to both cut your cholesterol levels now if they are already high - or reduce the chance of getting them in the future. &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/healthy-living/cholesterol-lowering-foods" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;It has drawn up a list of foods&lt;/a&gt; that can help cut high cholesterol - and set out exactly how much you should have of each every day to get the best benefit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It says: "There are several foods which are not just part of a healthy diet, they can actively help to lower your cholesterol too. Try to eat some of these every day as part of your healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "The more you add them to what you eat, the more they can help lower your cholesterol, especially if you cut down on &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/saturated-fat" rel="nofollow"&gt;saturated fa&lt;/a&gt; t as well." This is what they recommend: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Foods rich in unsaturated fats&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cut down on &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/saturated-fat" rel="nofollow"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; and replace it with unsaturated fats is great way to lower your cholesterol, says the charity. Foods which contain &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/fats-and-oils#unsaturated-fats" rel="nofollow"&gt;unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; include: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;vegetable oils such as olive, sunflower, corn, rapeseed, nut and seed oils&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;avocado, nuts and seeds&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fat spreads made from vegetable oils, such as sunflower and olive oil&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;oily fish&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim to eat two portions of fish per week, at least one of which should be oily.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The experts say: "Oily fish are a good source of healthy unsaturated fats, specifically a type called &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/low-cholesterol-foods/fats-and-oils#unsaturated-fats" rel="nofollow"&gt;omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A portion is 140g, but you could have two or three smaller portions throughout the week. Tinned, frozen or fresh all count e.g. salmon, sardines, pilchards, trout, herring and mackerel."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it warns to avoid coconut and palm oil as, unlike other vegetable oils, they are high in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fruit and vegetables&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fruit and vegetables&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fruits and vegetables can help reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke and some cancers. The experts explain: "They contain vitamins, minerals and plant chemicals which help you to stay healthy, and most contain little or no fat and are low in calories, so they can help you to stay a healthy weight. And, if you are eating more fruit and veg, chances are you're eating less of the other more energy-packed foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Fruit and vegetables are also high in fibre, and some types of fibre can help to lower your cholesterol. It blocks some cholesterol from being absorbed from the intestines into the blood stream."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good choices include pulses such as beans, peas and lentils as they are particularly high in this kind of fibre. Others include sweet potato, aubergine, okra (ladies’ fingers), broccoli, apples, strawberries and prunes are also good options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fruits and vegetables can be fresh, tinned, frozen or dried. however if you opt for tinned choose those in juice or water, without added sugar or salt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However some fruit and vegetables are not included when it comes to getting your five-a-day. Potatoes, yams, cassava and plantains count as a starchy food, like rice or pasta.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;while unsweetened fruit juice and smoothies are included but count only as one portion. The charity says: "More than one doesn’t count because the loose sugar and acid in them can damage your teeth."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;b&gt;You should aim for at least five portions of fruit and veg a day.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An adult portion is around 80g, or a handful.

Soya products are a good option for replacing foods which are high in saturated fat such as meat, full fat cream and dairy products, and snacks such as crisps."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim for: around two to three servings of soya a foods day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One serving is:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;a large glass (250ml) of soya milk&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;150g plain soya alternative to yogurt&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;150g Greek-style soya alternative to yogurt&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;100g soya mince&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a handful of soya nuts (35g) – also known as roasted edamame beans, you’ll find them in the nuts and snacks section&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;edamame beans, about 120g – you’ll find them in the frozen foods section&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;100g tofu – silken or firm&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPVWMzNUdGOVgwSEJOT2dGR1lnb2g2U2lsU1c1ZFdERWVWOVJ1cjc3b2dKM0xSR05TM1NZNnlyQ21QZFNGZHRHaGw0UGVTMExoUTU5ajhxUER0WEF0TnRGQTZmb2d2OXdxRjRJdEFSRTNTOUhrWHdCamdMMktpT0xxTw</guid></item><item><title>这种锻炼错误可能会伤害您的睡眠并使您感觉更糟- AOL.com | This workout mistake could hurt your sleep and make you feel worse - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE0xZ2FrQlVJdVgyYUZnRHNibWxlSFlWMHVUZjl1QVphckhLVmVIMjc1Z1pHT3hwai1wWGg1X0xaYThwZXUyOGctaXd5NmJWbXpJZ2NBRkFkTWhBOWxaRklwa2NtLXpQNHBMTC1JbHhleXBvMVI4UUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you prefer waking up early to start your day with a workout, or relieving the day’s stress by &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2025/03/28/top-6-exercises-everyone-should-do-to-stay-fit/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hitting the gym;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hitting the gym&lt;/a&gt; after work?

        &lt;p class="VideoEnhancement-title"&gt;5 measles cases confirmed in Gallatin County, 1st in Montana since 1990&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
        
    
    
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gallatin City-County Health Department said the five confirmed cases of measles are people who live in Gallatin County; all are currently isolated at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All five individuals are unvaccinated, or their vaccine status is not yet known, according to GCCHD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GCCHD is assessing any potential exposures that may have occurred while the individuals were contagious, and are contacting the people who may have been exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People potentially exposed are being provided with information about the exposure date and disease symptoms to watch out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GCCHD has determined that, at this point, there are two points of exposure to the general public: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monday, April 14: From noon to 4 p.m. at Interwest Tire, 6460 Jackrabbit Lane, Belgrade&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Friday, April 11: From 7:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. at North Coast Electric, 7401 Shedhorn Drive, Bozeman&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The times listed include the period when the exposure occurred and two hours after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can spread before people know they have the disease, and before any rash appears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who are immune to measles through vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or were born before 1957 are not considered at risk for infection. Individuals without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are unsure of your vaccination status, here are a few places you can review:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Call your old high school, college, or university and ask if they have vaccination records.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact your doctor’s office, urgent care, or pediatrician. Even if you have not been there in years, they may still have records.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact the health department where you grew up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check your home state immunization registries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;DPHHS released the following information about measles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Quote"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that typically begins with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth, and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. Cases in the U.S. are generally rare but have been increasing in recent years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97 to 99 percent effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are in need of the MMR vaccine, please call your primary care physician as soon as possible. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles is highly contagious and highly preventable with vaccination, and ensuring people are immunized remains our best defense. If people are unable to find their vaccine records, there are no contraindications to receiving an additional dose,” said Dr. Peter Bulger, GCCHD Medical Director.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;HONOLULU (Island News) – The Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) confirmed a new travel-related case of dengue virus on Oahu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total number of dengue cases in the state have been raised to seven in 2025 with one on Maui and six reported on Oahu. The affected person in the current case was reportedly exposed to the virus while traveling in a region where dengue is common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials state that the case is unrelated to the dengue cases that were reported on April 10 and 11 of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who plans to travel to or has recently visited a place with dengue risk is vulnerable to infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are reminding travelers to take the standard precautions when visiting such areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dengue is a year-round risk and appears in tropical and subtropical areas of Central and South America, Asia (including the Republic of the Philippines), the Middle East, Africa and several Pacific Islands, such as U.S. territories like America Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau. Many popular tourist destinations in the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico, are also affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travelers returning from dengue-endemic areas should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites for three weeks. If dengue symptoms develop within two weeks of return, travelers should seek medical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other countries are reporting increased dengue cases, including Fiji, French Polynesia, Tonga, the Republic of the Philippines, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travelers should review up-to-date country-specific travel information for guidance on dengue risk and prevention measures at least four to six weeks before traveling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click here for more information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-article  subscriber-hide tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-article tnt-inline-relation-sibling tnt-inline-presentation-summary tnt-inline-alignment-center tnt-inline-width-two-thirds"&gt;&lt;article id="card-summary-5fabd24a-d2bb-4f16-a88e-8944c4731742" class="tnt-asset-type-article clearfix card summary has-image  letterbox-style-blur  tnt-section-news tnt-sub-section-local"&gt;

(CREDIT: Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fight against &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/smart-immune-cells-continuously-hunt-180700518.html" data-ylk="slk:cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, researchers continue to look for everyday habits that might make a difference. A recent global study has shed new light on something many people do daily—drink coffee or tea. This study explored whether these popular beverages could lower the risk of head and neck cancer, a group of diseases that includes cancers of the mouth, throat, and voice box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results may give hope to millions of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/study-links-coffee-to-cancer-heart-disease-and-parkinsons-disease/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:coffee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; and tea drinkers worldwide. The findings suggest that drinking coffee, both caffeinated and decaffeinated, and even tea in certain amounts, may be linked to lower chances of developing certain types of head and neck cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A Global Look at a Growing Cancer Concern&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head and neck cancers are now the seventh most common type of cancer around the world. These cancers are becoming more frequent, especially in low- and middle-income countries. As more people are affected, scientists are working harder to understand how lifestyle choices might influence cancer risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;New research suggests that daily coffee consumption may help lower the risk of head and neck cancers. (CREDIT: Science Photo Library)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, studies on coffee and tea’s impact on these cancers have had mixed results. Some showed promise, while others found no clear link. To get a better picture, researchers from around the world came together to reanalyze a large amount of data. The team, led by the &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/huntsmancancerinstitute/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah&lt;/a&gt;, reviewed 14 different studies gathered by the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) consortium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This group looked at information from nearly 25,000 people. Of these, 9,548 had head and neck cancer, and 15,783 did not. Participants answered detailed questions about how much coffee and tea they drank over time. This included whether the coffee was regular or decaffeinated and how often they consumed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What the Study Revealed About Coffee&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed a clear trend: people who drank more than four cups of caffeinated coffee per day had lower odds of getting head and neck cancer. Specifically, these individuals had: 17% lower odds of developing any type of head and neck cancer, 30% lower odds of developing cancer of the mouth, and 22% lower odds of developing throat cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more striking, those who drank three to four cups daily had a 41% lower risk of developing hypopharyngeal cancer. This is a rare but serious type of cancer that starts at the bottom part of the throat, near the voice box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even decaffeinated coffee seemed to offer benefits. People who drank decaf had 25% lower odds of getting oral cavity cancer. This finding is important because it suggests that something other than &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/coffee-and-caffeine-consumption-linked-to-lower-risk-of-heart-disease/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caffeine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;—possibly antioxidants or other plant-based compounds in coffee—might be helping protect cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tea's Role in Cancer Risk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tea also showed some promise, especially when it came to hypopharyngeal cancer. People who drank tea had 29% lower odds of getting this type of cancer. Those who drank one cup or less per day had:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Study-specific odds ratios for &amp;gt;4 cups of caffeinated coffee daily versus non–coffee drinkers for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers. (CREDIT: American Cancer Society)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the relationship between tea and cancer risk wasn’t all positive. Drinking more than one cup of tea daily was linked with a 38% higher chance of developing laryngeal cancer, which affects the voice box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This surprising result shows that the effects of tea might vary depending on how much is consumed and which part of the head or neck is involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What These Findings Mean&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there has been prior research on coffee and tea consumption and reduced risk of cancer, this study highlighted their varying effects with different sub-sites of head and neck cancer, including the observation that even decaffeinated coffee had some positive impact,” said Yuan-Chin Amy Lee, the study’s senior author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like these kind of stories?

People drink them in many different ways—some with milk or &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/groundbreaking-sugar-treatment-could-cure-180700479.html" data-ylk="slk:sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;, some plain, and in different amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These habits might influence how coffee or tea affects the body. “These findings support the need for more data and further studies around the impact that coffee and tea can have on reducing cancer risk,” Lee added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study doesn't prove that coffee or tea prevents cancer. But it does suggest that these beverages could play a role in lowering the risk for some people. The research also helps show how different types of head and neck cancer may respond differently to substances found in these drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Takeaways for Everyday Life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're someone who drinks coffee or tea, this study offers some good news. While more research is needed, moderate coffee drinking could be linked with lower chances of developing certain cancers of the head and neck. Even decaf coffee might help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Characteristics of head and neck cancer cases and controls of select INHANCE consortium studies. (CREDIT: American Cancer Society)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to tea, a cup a day might help protect against some cancers, but more than that could raise the risk for others. This suggests a careful balance is needed. The kind of tea, how it’s made, and what’s added to it could all play a role in how it affects your &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/study-challenges-health-benefits-standing-160700589.html" data-ylk="slk:health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, no single food or drink can fully protect you from cancer. But understanding how common habits influence health is a key part of cancer prevention. These new findings may encourage more people to look at how everyday choices—like what you drink—could add up over time to support better health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: The article above provided above by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Brighter Side of News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Brighter Side of News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like these kind of feel good stories?

That’s according to a study just published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40227719/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicin&lt;/em&gt;e, April 14, 2025&lt;/a&gt;. The name CAT scan sounds innocuous, but in fact it represents ionizing radiation, similar to X-rays. According to these researchers, those CT scans will likely lead to more than 100,000 future cancers. Don’t get me wrong, though. There are times when such imaging is absolutely essential. This research raises an important question, though: is a proposed CT scan absolutely necessary, or is it a “just in case” extra test? What questions should you ask &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; having a CT image?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How CT Images Have Grown in Popularity:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1980 there were just 3 million CT scans according to &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/radiation-risk-from-medical-imaging"&gt;Harvard Health Publishing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The use of computed tomographic (CT) scans in the United States (US) has increased more than 3-fold since 1993 to approximately 70 million scans annually.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the year 2023, 62 million Americans received 93 million scans. Clearly, CT examinations have become extremely popular in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. Are they all necessary?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When CT Scans &lt;em&gt;Are&lt;/em&gt; Essential:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many situations when a CT scan &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; critical. If an ER doctor suspects a  bleeding (hemorrhagic) stroke, computed tomography of the head is indispensable for a fast diagnosis. Such scans are also excellent at detecting appendicitis, bowel obstruction, pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lungs), kidney stones and lung or colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a CT scan? Was it essential or one of those “just in case” scans to rule out something serious? Such imaging can be very helpful but &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if it is worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;My Personal Experience with a Critical CT Image:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can speak from experience about the value of this diagnostic tool. Several years ago I developed incredible abdominal pain during an airplane flight from California to North Carolina. The pain was so bad during the flight that I considered asking the flight attendant to request an emergency landing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I toughed it out, though, and when we arrived home a gastroenterologist friend advised heading straight to the emergency department of the nearest hospital. Within minutes I was getting a CT scan of my abdomen. The diagnosis was intussusception. My small intestine had slid into my large intestine and was causing bowel obstruction. Emergency abdominal surgery saved me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;CT Imaging Has Been Increasing!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On December 14, 2009 scientists published a landmark study in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/415368"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Background on Computed Tomographic Scans:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite the great medical benefits, there is concern about the potential radiation-related cancer risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Here is what they concluded:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rapid increase in CT scan use in the US has raised concerns about potential cancer risks, because when a large number of people are exposed, even small risks could translate into a large number of future cancers in the population. Our estimates suggest that approximately 29,000 future cancers could be related to CT scan use in the US in 2007.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fast Forward to April 2025:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40227719/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt; (April 14, 2025)&lt;/a&gt; projected the number of future cancers due to radiation exposure from computed tomography (CT) examinations. The investigators used data from the University of California San Francisco International CT Dose Registry and modeled the effects of the radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They estimated that approximately &lt;strong&gt;103,000 cancers&lt;/strong&gt; are likely to result from the 93 million scans conducted in 2023 on 60 million people. The risks are highest in children and adolescents, but many more adults undergo CT scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The scientists conclude that:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CT is frequently lifesaving, yet its potential harms are often overlooked, and even very small cancer risks will lead to a significant number of future cancers given the tremendous volume of CT use in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study, approximately 5% of annual cancer diagnoses or 100 000 cancers were projected to result from CT utilization in 2023. Despite public attention to the potential adverse effects, CT use has grown significantly in the United States since 2009. In 2023, 93 million CT examinations were performed in the United States; in 2007, the number was 68.7 million—a 35% increase incompletely explained by population growth. Justification of use and optimization of dose, including consideration of the need for multiphase examinations, are the tenets of CT imaging and must be applied uncompromisingly to mitigate potential harm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal is not to scare patients, but to help them understand going forward they need to think about every time a CT is suggested. Do they need it? Do they understand why it’s done and work with their physician? Is this really a test I need now? Maybe it’s a test I can postpone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman is a radiologist and professor of epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;As the first author on the study, &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/04/429791/popular-ct-scans-could-account-5-all-cancer-cases-year"&gt;she points out&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CT can save lives, but its potential harms are often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the large volume of CT use in the United States, many cancers could occur in the future if current practices don’t change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our estimates put CT on par with other significant risk factors, such as alcohol consumption and excess body weight,” she said. “Reducing the number of scans and reducing doses per scan would save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is currently unacceptable variation in the doses used for CT, with some patients receiving excessive doses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Much Radiation Is Involved in a CT Scan?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;When we first wrote about this issue roughly 16 years ago, we wrote:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The radiation exposure from the computed tomography ranged from less than a year’s worth of background radiation to 13 times that. Some experts have compared the radiation in a single CT scan to that from 400 chest X-rays. Others say it is comparable to the radiation experienced by survivors of the Nagasaki atomic bomb blast. As a result, patients are now being urged to make sure that the scan is absolutely necessary before they agree to it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, it’s a lot more complicated. That is because there are a variety of computed tomography scanners on the market. There are cardiac scanners that are employed to look inside the heart. They can identify blockages and help interventional cardiologists prepare to open a blocked coronary artery or plan a valve replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A head CT imaging machine would help diagnose a brain tumor or a stroke. A chest CT scanner can be helpful in identifying emphysema or lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different kinds of machines use different amounts of radiation. There are now low-dose scanners and even ultra-low-dose CT scanners. It is a bit challenging to try and put quantitative numbers behind each machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“…emits only one-fifth of the radiation of a regular CT scan, making it safer for routine testing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such low-dose equipment is especially helpful when screening for lung problems or checking for issues in a pediatric population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Denoised ultra-low dose CT (ULDCT) can effectively diagnose pneumonia in immunocompromised patients using only 2% of the radiation dose of standard CT, according to a study published in &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/ryct.240189"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radiology: Cardiothoracic Imaging&lt;/em&gt; (March 13, 2025)&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Questions to Ask &lt;em&gt;Before&lt;/em&gt; Agreeing to a CT Scan:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming you are NOT in an emergency situation, here are some questions you might want to ask regarding the benefits and risks of CT imaging:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are you ordering a CT scan at this time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important will these images be for analyzing or diagnosing my health problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would a low-dose CT scanning device or ultra-low-dose imaging equipment be appropriate for my situation? If so, can you request such a scan at a place that has this kind of equipment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will my insurance pay for a low-dose scan?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will the results of a CT image alter my treatment plan?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I delay the scan, will it adversely affect my health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course during an emergency, a CT scan can be crucial and all such questions should be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Final Words:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I greatly benefitted from a CT scan when I was suffering a bowel obstruction due to intussusception. It allowed the surgeon to make a fast diagnosis and start the surgical procedure in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about you? Have you ever had a CT scan? What was that procedure like? Did it reveal something important or was it a “just in case” initiative? Please share your experience in the comment section below. If you think this article has value, please share it with friends and family. You never know when someone might need to have the questions we posed above on hand to ask the physician who is recommending the scan.

That suggests we should be paying much closer attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our guest, Dr. Mark Hyman, has indeed been paying attention for years. His recent book, &lt;em&gt;Young Forever&lt;/em&gt;, describes how to lower the risks for chronic disease with lifestyle and dietary changes. Some people have even been able to reverse conditions such as type 2 diabetes or psoriatic arthritis. Inflammation is the driver of many chronic conditions, and we can reduce inflammation with appropriate food choices, adequate physical activity and healthful doses of stress (not too much or too little). Embracing these changes can help us towards our longest, healthiest life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Seven Core Biological Systems as the Basis for Health:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Young Forever&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Hyman describes seven core biological systems, and he discusses them in this episode. The first is the system for assimilating nutrients, and the microbiome is key in this process. Dr. Hyman urges us to tend this inner garden with care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second system is for defense and repair. Doctors call it the immune system, and it guards against infection as well as internal perils like cancer. Although the immune system itself creates inflammation in response to a threat, calming inflammation with breath work, meditation, optimal sleep and experiencing love and community helps lead to better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third is the energy system. Mitochondria in every cell create the energy to fuel our bodies. How can we support them most effectively?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detoxification is another core biological system, carried out by the liver, kidneys, lungs, skin and digestive system. This system can be overwhelmed by excess toxins, including heavy metals or pesticides. Reducing exposures and fortifying the detoxification process is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the parts of our bodies need to communicate with each other. They do that through hormones, neurotransmitters and other cell-signaling molecules. If this system is not functioning well, health can deteriorate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sixth and seventh core systems are transport (circulation and lymph) and infrastructure (bones, muscles, cells and tissues). It’s easy to see why these are critical to living your longest, healthiest life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lifespan vs. Healthspan:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You already know that lifespan measures the time between the day you are born and the day you die. Healthspan measures only the amount of time that you enjoy good health. How can we make our healthspan include as much of our lifespan as possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t usually think of our age as something we can actually change. Even lying about it, should we wish to do so, doesn’t change the actual number of years we have spend on the planet. Biological age is more mutable, though. Dr. Hyman managed to lower his biological age several years in his early 40s. How did he do that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recipes for Your Longest, Healthiest Life:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hyman describes his visits to Blue Zones such as Sardinia and Loma Linda. He has taken the insights from Blue Zone longevity research and distilled them into recipes for his cookbook. We asked him to describe some of his favorite breakfasts and why organic food—from plants that are stressed—offers benefits for the people eating it. Hear about Himalayan buckwheat and sweet potato and egg stacks with cashew hollandaise sauce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Three Words to the Wise:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked Dr. Hyman to offer us three ways to improve our chances for the longest healthiest life, starting now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Cut refined starch and sugar as much as possible.&lt;br&gt;
2. Get enough protein (1 gram per lb body weight) and physical activity to maintain and build muscle.&lt;br&gt;
3. Get involved in your community, whatever that happens to be. Living with meaning and purpose can help extend your life by five to seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;This Week’s Guest:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Hyman, MD is a practicing family physician and an internationally recognized leader, speaker, educator, and advocate in the field of functional medicine.

TNBC is more invasive and has a higher risk of recurrence than other breast cancer subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="M4VVP3BD7BHKLBCWHN3Q2N4TPA"&gt;Generally speaking, linoleic acid is an essential nutrient needed to build cell membranes, protect skin, and support heart health. However, the study notes that since the 1950s, linoleic acid consumption has increased significantly as cooking oils have become commonplace in fried and ultra-processed foods. These findings are believed to be the first to raise concerns about the fatty acid’s potential link to disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="C4XMK2O7IVBW3K7ZTU6JFBD434"&gt;“We now know that linoleic acid feeds cancer cell growth in a very specific way,” said Dr. John Blenis, the study’s senior author and a cancer researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine, to the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/16/lifestyle/cooking-oil-linked-to-aggressive-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://nypost.com/2025/04/16/lifestyle/cooking-oil-linked-to-aggressive-breast-cancer/"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;. He explained this study was significant as it “sheds light on how to define which patients might benefit from specific nutritional recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="C6C3NTJKMJH6JNJAVPBQVF5KCY"&gt;However, he noted that this research shouldn’t make people fearful of linoleic acid. “The findings do not warrant blanket avoidance of seed oils but suggest moderation and selectivity, especially for high-risk individuals,” he said. He further stressed that “a balanced, whole food diet remains an important cornerstone of cancer prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3DYYUZOYHNBBJFI6LK7H5CHMNY"&gt;As for what vegetable and seed oils are high in linoleic acid, sunflower oil, corn oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, and cottonseed oil all make the list. Linoleic acid is also found in nuts, seeds, meats and eggs but in much smaller amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Syracuse.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 21:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员确认夏威夷今年第7例登革热病例-檀香山Star-Advertiser | Health officials confirm Hawaii’s 7th dengue case this year - Honolulu Star-Advertiser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxObFlQSVdPb1hsNk45MjQxSHZkS3V2dkFXYldfZklrdjdkZXlBX0FjeVZiTHdaLTM1di1aR0ZNVmhaR3hrQnh3WWJHcVNQeVNWekhoXzRjaFNraW9KeEJEMlh1ZXJhendIWjdTRDdEMkNRZUw2V0VpbnBWaWJSMDV0RDQ2RFVfZXVISW1iTTdfRUtONW1tdll1dUZEQTVMX2NETlNIR0kyTzkwTFBpeEZzaG5uMm9Rdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-content" class="post col-12 col-md-11 clearfix"&gt;
                                &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health today confirmed another travel-related case of dengue on Oahu, bringing the total number in the state to seven so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest case comes just about a week after the &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/11/breaking-news/hawaii-sees-another-dengue-case-bringing-total-to-6-this-year/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;fifth and sixth cases&lt;/a&gt; of dengue were reported on Oahu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the affected individual was exposed to the virus while traveling in a region where dengue is common, and that this case is not related to cases reported on April 10 and 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams were deployed to the affected area on Oahu, which the Health Department did not disclose, to implement mosquito control measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, there have been six cases on Oahu and one on Maui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dengue&lt;/a&gt; is a viral illness spread by mosquitoes, which can be transmitted from an infected person to a mosquito to a person. While Hawaii is home to Aedes mosquitoes, which can carry dengue, the disease is not endemic, or established in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include the sudden onset of fever, severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, muscle and joint pain, and rash, which typically last two to seven days, state health officials said. While severe illness can occur, most people recover within a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone planning to travel to an area with dengue risk is vulnerable, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dengue is a year-round risk in the tropical and subtropical areas of Central and South America; popular tourist destinations in the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico; Asia; the Middle East; Africa; and several Pacific Islands, including American Samoa, Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/images/global-dengue.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;listed countries&lt;/a&gt; reporting higher-than-usual numbers of cases or higher-than-expected cases among returning U.S. travelers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC advises travelers to areas with risk of dengue to prevent mosquito bites by using an EPA-registered insect repellent, wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors, and sleeping in an air-conditioned room or a room with window screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If symptoms develop within two weeks after a trip, residents should seek medical advice from a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you’ve ever questioned whether a few too many drinks could affect your brain, a new study has some pretty concerning news. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/brazil/index.html" id="mol-aa338b10-1bc4-11f0-9efb-3fa3af9d5272"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; have found that drinking just eight or more alcoholic beverages a week can significantly increase your risk of developing brain lesions- damage that could mess with your memory and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These brain lesions, linked to a condition called 'hyaline arteriolosclerosis,' are caused when the tiny blood vessels in the brain narrow and harden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This reduces blood flow, which, over time, can lead to brain damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It sounds like something out of a sci-fi thriller, but unfortunately, the reality is less dramatic and more alarming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research, published in the journal Neurology, focused on nearly 1,800 individuals from the UK’s Biobank health database. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants were grouped based on their alcohol consumption habits - non-drinkers, moderate drinkers (people who have seven or fewer drinks per week), former heavy drinkers, and those who continued to drink heavily until the end of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And what the researchers found was startling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Having eight or more alcoholic drinks a week can increase your chances of developing brain lesions, a new study has found (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the study, moderate drinkers actually had a 60 percent higher chance of developing brain lesions compared to those who abstained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it gets worse for former heavy drinkers - those who used to drink a lot but quit had an 89 percent higher risk of brain lesions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The worst-case scenario? Heavy drinkers who still hadn't stopped had a 133 percent greater risk of developing these lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the dangers don’t stop there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also showed that heavy drinkers, even if they eventually stopped, had higher odds of developing tau tangles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tau tangles is a neurological marker associated with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This finding suggests that the long-term effects of heavy drinking can leave lasting damage, even if you’ve stopped drinking altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perhaps most shocking, the study indicated that lifelong heavy drinkers tend to die, on average, 13 years earlier than those who abstain from alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Long-term heavy drinking can have negative effects on your life span even if you stop (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s a reminder that those nights of excessive drinking could have consequences aside from a hangover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research team, led by vascular expert Alberto Fernando Oliveira Justo, made it clear that while they didn’t establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship, the association between heavy drinking and brain damage is hard to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And though the data was based on the health records of UK residents, the findings are widely applicable to anyone who drinks regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While moderate drinkers didn’t fare as badly as heavy drinkers, the findings are still a wake-up call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even if you’re not getting blackout drunk every weekend, regularly exceeding eight drinks a week could put your brain at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study serves as a reminder that moderation isn’t just for calories and carbs - it’s crucial for maintaining long-term brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, maybe it’s time to swap out that second (or third) glass of wine for something a little more brain-friendly. Your cognitive function may depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new study in &lt;em&gt;BMJ Global Health&lt;/em&gt; across 13 middle- and high-income countries reveals that 25% of patients reported symptoms of long COVID after symptomatic COVID-19, and long COVID is significantly more prevalent in participants from less wealthy nations and in patients of Arab or North African ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second study published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt; showed that, among 3,693 COVID-19 patients in China, 30.2% reported at least one persistent long-COVID symptom, and 10.7% noted symptoms affecting daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher rate in those of Arab/North African ethnicity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/10/4/e017126"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The first study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; involved 6,528 adult patients with symptomatic COVID-19 in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long COVID was defined as the presence of patient-reported symptoms 180 days after COVID-19, the authors said.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 25.1% of participants who said they experienced long-COVID symptoms, 12.8% reported sleeping disorders, 9.8% reported joint pain, 8.7% had fatigue, and 8.1% noted headaches. Almost a third of participants (29.8%) from lower middle-income countries said they had long COVID, compared with 14.4% in high-income countries (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10 to 2.14).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highest long-COVID prevalence was seen in patients with Arab/North African ethnicity (36.1%), and hospitalized patient were also at increased risk of long COVID (aOR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.63 to 2.54).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results thus suggest that the burden to health and healthcare-related costs may fall disproportionately on countries with the least capacity to carry them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results thus suggest that the burden to health and healthcare-related costs may fall disproportionately on countries with the least capacity to carry them, and most frequently affect individuals that may be under-represented in clinical trials of interventions aimed to combat long COVID," the authors wrote.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Older age, re-infection tied to higher risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-025-22671-x"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In the second study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, people with COVID-19 were asked to complete a survey on symptoms 180 days after infection in March 2023 through June 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older age, female sex, and COVID re-infection were all associated with increased risk for self-reported long COVID. Reported use of Chinese medicine and more than three vaccine doses were protective factors.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
