          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you've ever &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/wellness-us/article-13101007/narcissists-phrases-fighting-psychologists.html"&gt;argued with a narcissist&lt;/a&gt;, you already know that it's nearly impossible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They typically resort to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-13521415/Im-psychiatrist-5-myths-gaslighting-tell-happening-you.html"&gt;gaslighting and manipulation&lt;/a&gt; when they don't get their way - making it extremely hard to expect the truth out of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But psychologists say that this may no longer be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the solution may just be in the messaging you're giving them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the study published in&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.psypost.org/scientists-discover-how-to-psychologically-inoculate-narcissists-against-dishonesty/"&gt; Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;, narcissists care deeply about how they're perceived by others even if they are prone to dishonesty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study looked at using an 'inoculation' technique with narcissists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Essentially, this means persuading someone to do something by convincing them not to do something else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They wanted to test this by having participants read a code of ethics and then conducting tests to see how they'd act afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Narcissists typically use gaslight and manipulation (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Except for one group, instead of the code of ethics explaining why people should have integrity, it featured information on what happens to people when they manipulate, lie, or cheat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This 'inoculation' version of the code of ethics warned students that people who engage in bad behaviors often end up with damaged reputations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tests they conducted afterwards on these participants included measuring of both intentions and actual dishonest behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The assessment of intentions was based on Machiavellianism and psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was found that individuals that were found to 'score higher in narcissism' also reported to have more ethical intentions after reading the 'inoculation' message. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in terms of actual behavior, researchers used a coin-flipping test to see whether participants would cheat or not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As it turns out, those who were identified as narcissists were less likely to cheat during the test if they had read the 'inoculated' code of ethics first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Interestingly, those who did not score high in narcissism did not have great results after being exposed to the 'inoculation' message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Discouraging bad behavior and explaining those consequences can be more effective than simply encouraging good behavior (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, it made them more aware of potential justifications to bad behavior.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So what does this all really mean in terms of communicating with a narcissist?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rather than trying to appeal to their morality, it's better to accept that this isn't a strong suit of theirs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, you may be better off engaging them by speaking about something they might more likely be affected by: their reputation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By letting them know the way other people perceive them may be at stake if they engage in certain behaviors, you might just stop them from doing so.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A recent surge in cases of the bacterial infection, usually spread by sexual contact, has alarmed her and other physicians across Hampton Roads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As cases have climbed in all demographics locally and across Virginia and the country — even in newborns and seniors — a regional collaboration called the Stop Syphilis Coalition is launching a public awareness campaign this month to educate residents and providers on risk factors, symptoms and screening recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our region has some of the highest rates of syphilis in Virginia,” Girois said. “This needs to be at the top of people’s minds, because it can be such a devastating and even deadly infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-aGsPBxFR" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_aGsPBxFR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by the Virginia Department of Health and the M.

(Kendall Warner / The Virginian-Pilot)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top goals include promoting screening for all pregnant women — who can pass an infection to their baby, increasing conversations between physicians and patients on prevention and testing options, expanding screening in emergency rooms and outpatient settings, and strengthening data tracking and contact tracing methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of pregnancy, current federal health guidelines call for screening at-risk, sexually-active teenagers and adults, especially if they are between the ages of 15 and 44 and live in areas with high rates of syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have multiple sexual partners, gay or bisexual men, and patients with HIV or another sexually-transmitted infection are among the groups in high-risk categories; having unprotected oral, vaginal or anal sex further raises the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left untreated, syphilis can lead to serious and even life-threatening damage to the brain, spinal cord, heart, liver, blood vessels, joints, eyes and ears. An infection in unborn babies, known as congenital syphilis, also increases the odds of premature birth and stillbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In older patients, syphilis typically starts as a single sore on the genitals, rectum or mouth that is firm yet painless. The infection spreads mainly through direct contact with those lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The word ‘sore’ is misleading, unfortunately, as these lesions generally don’t hurt,” said Dr. Charles Frazier, senior vice president and chief medical information and innovation officer at Riverside Health System. “People might ignore them or not even be aware of them, but they need to get checked as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that syphilis is 100% treatable with penicillin. Most adult patients are cured with just one injection of the antibiotic; others may need two or three if the disease has progressed to a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have had unprotected sex with an infected partner, or who don’t know a partner’s history, also may be candidates for doxycycline, an antibiotic that can be taken as a “morning after” treatment to potentially stop syphilis from developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most newborns with congenital syphilis, however, must spend 10 days on intravenous penicillin in intensive care. Without quick treatment, complications can include rashes, fever, anemia, bone changes, developmental delays, swelling in the spleen and liver and hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every case of congenital syphilis is a preventable tragedy,” Girois noted. “Our message is that if you’re pregnant, please, please seek prenatal care.” Obstetricians generally screen expectant mothers at their first appointment and again at 28 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syphilis cases have been climbing steadily in Virginia in recent years, with Hampton Roads a frequent hot spot — particularly for congenital syphilis. In 2024, the Eastern Virginia Health Region accounted for 15 of the state’s 36 congenital cases, according to VDH data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials aren’t sure what’s behind the rise, although a higher number of infected patients naturally leads to more widespread transmission. Girois also theorizes that the intense fear of STIs that drove safe sex practices at the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has subsided as fewer patients die of that infection; more adults, meanwhile, are continuing to date into their senior years, when they don’t need protection to prevent pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syphilis is a complex infection with four stages. Most patients first develop a lesion about three weeks after infection. Next, they may experience a rash that can start on the trunk of the body and spread to the limbs, palms of the hands or soles of the feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untreated patients then enter a “latent” phase, when bacteria remain in their bodies but may not cause symptoms for months or years. Those who progress to a final stage, tertiary syphilis, can face dementia, paralysis, balance problems, heart failure and vision and/or hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stop Syphilis Coalition plans to conduct a widespread print and social media education campaign and provide fact sheets to community-based providers and organizations who encounter at-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members also are discussing changing strategies within health care systems. Riverside, for example, has built educational links on syphilis into its electronic medical records system, easily accessed by its community-based providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_7515399" class="wp-caption alignright size-article_inline_third"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.dailypress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-02-120431.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="Dr. Lawrence Leslie, deputy medical director for the Emergency Department at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital.

(Courtesy of Sentara Health)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Sentara, emergency department leaders are developing stronger protocols to ensure prompt screening of at-risk patients such as those with HIV, gonorrhea and/or chlamydia, all STIs. That could involve offering more onsite tests along with referrals to outpatient providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to develop the most streamlined pathway to get people into the right setting for education, follow-up testing and treatment,” said Dr. Lawrence Leslie, deputy medical director for the Emergency Department at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital. “Hopefully this is an area where we can make an immediate impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, screening soon could become easier with new rapid blood tests, which can deliver results about 15 minutes after a finger prick. Previously, samples have gone to a laboratory with about a two-day turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to treat people before they walk out the door would be a gamechanger,” Girois said. “It’s time for us to be much more systematic about offering testing.

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pascal Geldsetzer, at Stanford University, said: “For the first time we are able to say much more confidently that the shingles vaccine causes a reduction in dementia risk. If this truly is a causal effect, we have a finding that’s of tremendous importance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers took advantage of a vaccination rollout that took place in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; more than a decade ago. Public health policy dictated that from 1 September 2013, people born on or after 2 September 1933 became eligible for the Zostavax shot, while those who were older missed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The policy created a natural experiment where the older population was sharply divided into two groups depending on their access to the vaccine. This allowed the researchers to compare dementia rates in older people born weeks apart but on either side of the vaccine eligibility divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After accounting for the fact that not all those eligible for the vaccine received it, the researchers found vaccination led to a 20% reduction in dementia risk, with the strongest effect in women. Anupam Jena, a professor of healthcare policy at Harvard Medical School, said the implications were profound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dementia affects more than 55 million people globally and is the leading cause of death in the UK. One in three will develop the condition in their lifetime, and while drugs that slow the disease have recently been approved, there is no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When people contract chickenpox the virus remains dormant in their nerve cells for life. But the virus can reactivate and cause shingles in older people whose immune systems are waning, or in individuals with weakened immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The latest work, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in Nature&lt;/a&gt;, is not the first hint that shingles vaccines might shield against dementia. When Zostavax was rolled out in the US in 2006, several studies found lower rates of dementia in people who received the shots. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/25/shingles-vaccine-shingrix-may-delay-dementia-onset-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Oxford researchers reported an even stronger protective effect&lt;/a&gt; in people who received Shingrix, a newer vaccine. Geldsetzer is now looking for philanthropic and private foundations to fund a randomised clinical trial to confirm any benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It is unclear how shingles vaccines might protect against dementia, but one theory is that they reduce inflammation in the nervous system by preventing reactivation of the virus. Another theory is that the vaccines induce broader changes in the immune system that are protective. These wider effects are seen more often in women, potentially explaining the sex differences in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In an accompanying article, Jena wrote: “Although it is still unclear precisely how herpes zoster vaccination lowers the risk of dementia, the implications of the study are profound. The vaccine could represent a cost-effective intervention that has public-health benefits strongly exceeding its intended purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Julia Dudley, the head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said the study strengthened the emerging link between shingles vaccination and reduced dementia risk. “While previous studies suggested an association, this research offers stronger evidence of a direct link, with greater benefit observed in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s unclear exactly how the shingles vaccine might influence dementia risk. It may reduce inflammation, support the immune system in ways that protect the brain or involve other mechanisms. It’s important to note that this study looked at the Zostavax vaccine rather than Shingrix, which is now more commonly used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Understanding this link better, including the reason for any differences between men and women, could open new avenues for dementia prevention and treatment,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maxime Taquet, whose Oxford study found a reduced dementia risk after Shingrix vaccination, said adjuvants in that vaccine, which make the immune response more potent, may play a role. Both studies “provide strong support for the hypothesis that shingles vaccination reduces dementia risk, with the newer recombinant vaccine offering superior protection,” he said. “A key question is whether this enhanced protection is due to improved shingles prevention or the adjuvant’s immunological effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 15:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxPVy1mZ254YmZWSWFnekZEbVFONTJjQWV2UzVZTUE2ZGJRU3dUTWNiME9Hc0FmNGZTTzlTNmVta0pzeXVvSTJIcjlrcXJFb1N1NGdQQTgwVDZ4M3Qwam9LU3dMS3RkcTZ1VlMwX0FJcVR2UHg3RlhEdC02aUIyUFdkQ3NTLUUtS0h1enFxY0M1MlFkUm93NDExU3lyb2ZJN25HYWdISDJ3dWdFaDIwbmlmR0tmX0JyRXB4ZWVfeUg1RUNReEc4Wm1Z</guid></item><item><title>Why autism isn’t diagnosed in girls and women - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTFBWUHU0Sktua29TeGFBeFlKNUV2dktnY1o4RVV4ZTdPd192cmVaUkxqOVJnNVZzNFBOank5ZkVPeUFqcHl0cEJsSXlGS1BOMUhLTFhEUlJUc0h2Z25YLTVLRmY3RFliZUpzMUhSc2lycUlERVhkSlA1U0Fqc0Zrd9IBdEFVX3lxTE1NaGVDd3BnTTM5YTlwSVVtVWp2NjNUZFpqYm1wQ2JfRndCdVVxTVZhSkE4XzJDTVhjTGZHRjdWOVlCNFpkbkxIVFNvTXd3bUN4TUhyc1VYOFFPQWRTaXZwelNSZmIwMkxNRFNTUDlMMV8yYWFR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Researchers historically have viewed autism as a distinctly “male” &lt;a href="https://aane.org/autism-info-faqs/library/autism-adhd/" target="_blank"&gt;neurotype&lt;/a&gt;.

            But why? Is it because they only paid attention to symptoms in boys, and girls haven’t been screened properly? Boys are 10 times more likely than girls to be referred for autism assessments, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8604819/" target="_blank"&gt;a 2020 review&lt;/a&gt; showed, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10813290/" target="_blank"&gt;a 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; suggests that up to 80% of girls and women may receive a diagnosis of social anxiety, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/27/health/what-is-an-eating-disorder-wellness/index.html"&gt;eating disorder&lt;/a&gt; or borderline personality disorder before being accurately diagnosed as autistic.

            Rippon, professor emeritus of cognitive neuroimaging at the Aston Brain Centre in Birmingham, England, investigates how and why scientists and clinicians have systematically underestimated and overlooked autism in women and girls.

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylpzn2000h356md00tm0st@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00621-3" target="_blank"&gt;In a 2024 review,&lt;/a&gt; Rippon found of the more than 120 studies testing brain models of autism that she examined, nearly 70% of the studies only tested men or included very few women. She noted that less than 10% of the 4,000 participants in those studies were women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylpzn2000i356m9l9d9b6b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rippon said she was startled to discover the extent to which she and her colleagues had fundamentally misunderstood the nature of autism in girls and women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            CNN recently talked with Rippon about autism in girls and women, the challenges of current diagnostics, and how medical professionals can think differently about screening without bias.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylpzn2000k356mmrg2qd8o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What inspired you to investigate autism in girls?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8yiufb80000356m1ph0m8rq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Gina Rippon: &lt;/strong&gt;There was this very strong belief up until recently that autism was a male problem. As a result, a big industry grew around autism diagnosis to reliably indicate whether a child had autism. But they were only looking at the kind of behavior that was characteristic of boys. If girls came along with similarly disordered behavior, the idea that it might be autism just didn’t emerge.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9000y356m97lx9c95@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were so-called “gold-standard” tests, but because the tests were based on boys, girls would be screened out. For a neuroscientist like me who wanted to look at autism in females, I wouldn’t be able to find any females who had been diagnosed as autistic. It got embedded in our consciousness, “OK, this is a male problem, so we probably better just look at males.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9000z356m9n8almm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How did the system get so biased?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90010356mqblj0b0e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon:&lt;/strong&gt; I like to say the diagnostic dice were loaded from the start. There is no biomarker for autism — there’s not a handy X-ray or some physical test we can use to diagnose autism. Instead, there are a huge array of different behaviors which, over the years, have (been) identified as characteristic of autistic children. (But) it’s all based on what it looks like in boys.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90011356m0lr1ek3n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://magazine.smhs.gwu.edu/news/observation-autism" target="_blank"&gt;Kevin Pelphrey&lt;/a&gt;, one of the top autism researchers in the world, has two autistic children — one girl, one boy. His wife describes how difficult it was for them to get their daughter diagnosed. You would think they would know what they were talking about, yet their daughter’s diagnosis was dismissed across the board. Experts would say, “She’s shy, she’ll grow out of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90012356m2j3et83j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Why is it so difficult for experts to identify autism in girls?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90013356m44dtlixs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s the classic confirmation bias, which is the tendency to interpret new evidence as a confirmation of one’s existing beliefs.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90014356mxb113y65@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers have presented identical hypothetical scenarios to teachers, saying, “This child presents with these kinds of issues in the classroom, so do you think this child might be autistic? Do you think this child might need special support?” Teachers are much more likely to say yes to the notion that the child was autistic and needed support if the child was named Jack than if the child was named Chloe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90015356mbspnqj6h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Behavioral differences in autistic children emerge early on. Those are times when teachers who have broad experience of a much wider range of children should be able to say, “This kind of behavior is unusual. I think we should take it further.” Instead, if behaviors are unusual and it’s a boy, it’s autism, but if behaviors are unusual and it’s a girl, she’s shy, socially anxious, and people might say, “she’ll grow out of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90016356m8nngf1al@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Secondly, autism presents differently in girls versus boys. Girls who are distressed in some way very often internalize their problems. They become withdrawn and shy, stand in the corner, don’t engage with other children. If you’ve got children who are shy and quiet and stand quietly in the corner, you aren’t going to think there’s a problem and maybe you’ll even move on. If you’ve got children who are acting out by banging their heads against a desk or kicking, which is more characteristic of boys, those are the kids you’re going to look at more closely.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90017356mfpl6bagv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The third layer is that there is clear evidence that girls try to camouflage or disguise or mask their problems. That happens very early on, at age 4 or 5. If you find the right way of asking them questions, they will say, “Other people in the class think I’m weird. I try and find out why they think I’m weird, and I try and behave not weird.” I call these kids chameleons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90018356mjkrgnv62@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is nothing new. In the 1980s, a researcher named &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4495836/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Lorna Wing&lt;/a&gt;, who was partially responsible for broadening the notion of autism, said, “Maybe girls are just better at disguising their problems,” and “Maybe girls are taught to behave better earlier on.” It’s not socially acceptable for girls to act out, so they don’t.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90019356mija0qc32@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What can a diagnosis mean to a young woman who has been struggling?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001a356muiex9q2k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon:&lt;/strong&gt; All the women I spoke to said their first and most powerful reaction on getting a diagnosis of autism was a sense of relief, because it suddenly made so much sense of their lives. For older women, it was very often then a sense of regret, how different their lives would’ve been if they’d known.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001b356m4ngf1h6w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Particularly the girls who are so desperate to belong, what struck me is how much at odds this is from the view of autism as an aloofness — as if autistic individuals aren’t interested in social contact. With autistic females, it’s almost the reverse. They’re desperate for social contact, but they lack what you might call social instinct, knowing how to behave in social situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001c356ms4odt6c9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the girls I talked to for my book told me it’s a bit like how people who are deaf from birth wouldn’t understand that there’s this kind of invisible something that is the sound of words, which people use to communicate with each other. Autistic girls could be described as deaf to the language of social behavior, so they don’t understand how you stand properly or maintain eye contact, or that you aren’t supposed to go on about your favorite subject for an hour. For these girls, a diagnosis can be very freeing and validating.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How can experts learn to diagnose girls at a younger age?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001e356m2h8u6pp6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon&lt;/strong&gt;: One thing that has struck me is that the notion of hypersensitivity to sensory issues such as scratchy clothes, bright lights, smells and so on, is more characteristic of girls on the spectrum than boys. And that’s only just come into the diagnosis. It was in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(DSM-5-TR).&lt;br&gt;Although sensory issues have been very characteristic of autism as a whole — and very often there are reports of autistic children hating loud noises or bright lights or whatever — it wasn’t a diagnostic characteristic until quite recently. Having this in the diagnostic criteria might help.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001f356mbxdwnpfu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Raising awareness and accepting that autistic children of both sexes should be allowed special accommodations at school, such as taking tests in a separate room or wearing headphones. That’s very important.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001g356m5hyuf7vu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For autistic girls like chameleons, who might be hypersensitive to what they perceive as social rejection, it’s also important to teach kindness to all children. Some of the saddest interviews I had were the ones with young girls who were hyperaware that people thought they were weird and odd.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001h356mp9vm3hxi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not a fan of pharmaceutical solutions for young children, partly because it is a time at which our brains are hugely plastic. At the same time, sleep disturbances and gastrointestinal disorders are characteristic among autistic kids, and if left untreated these (issues) can interfere with social activities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001j356mladu2wlr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s also a lot about autism you can’t treat. A lot of the behavioral difficulties that autistic individuals have are side effects of their autism; they get hugely anxious because they don’t know how to deal with social situations, not because they need anxiety medication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s critical for researchers to speak to autistic people and ask, “What is it like to be you?” That perspective is invaluable. There’s a big movement for what is called inclusivity or participatory research, where autistic people become part of the research team.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm900gurg00033b6mq3eol5p5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;They advise what kind of questions to ask, they advise how you might interpret the answers you’re getting. There’s a video I recommend called “Here Come the Girls,” and in it, autistic women basically say, “We are autistic, and this is what it’s like for us.” I think that inclusivity is the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon:&lt;/strong&gt; Autism doesn’t only affect boys; girls can be autistic, too. The world has not accommodated autistic girls until the last decade or so. Thankfully, that’s changing. Here come the girls.

Using data from two national databases, researchers found consistent results: about 16% of pregnant women developed Long COVID symptoms versus 19% of matched non-pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While pregnancy appears to offer some protection, certain subgroups—such as women with obesity, older maternal age, or who identify as Black—were at higher risk. The findings point to a potential protective role of immune changes during and after pregnancy and highlight the need for more focused Long COVID research in pregnant populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Pregnant women had a lower rate of Long COVID than non-pregnant peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher-Risk Groups:&lt;/strong&gt; Black women, those 35+, and those with metabolic conditions faced higher risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistent Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings held across two national health data networks and different definitions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Weill Cornell University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pregnancy may offer some protection from developing Long COVID, found a new study led by Weill Cornell Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, University of Utah Health and Louisiana Public Health Institute. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has mostly focused on non-pregnant adults affected by Long COVID— a condition lasting for months after a person recovers from SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published April 1 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, helps fill a critical gap about Long COVID in women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108360"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne.jpg" alt="This shows two pregnant women." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Among the pregnant women, the researchers found that certain groups had higher Long COVID risks than others. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This population is so important and vulnerable, but we had no evidence about their Long COVID risk to guide their care,” said Dr. Chengxi Zang, an instructor in population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine, who co-led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this new data will help clinicians develop better Long COVID prevention and treatment strategies for pregnant women and help those most at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digging into Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tapped into real-world data collected in two large electronic health record-based studies, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) and the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), under the National Institutes of Health RECOVER initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They analyzed data on approximately 72,000 women who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy between March 2020 and June 2023 and about 208,000 age and demographically matched controls who were not pregnant but developed the infection during this period. They looked for signs of Long COVID 180 days after the women recovered from infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that the rates of long-term complications related to COVID-19 are lower among pregnant women than comparably matched women who were not pregnant during their infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were consistent across both large databases and held true even when the researchers used different methods to define Long COVID. This consistency adds confidence to the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the PCORnet cohort&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Zang and his colleagues found that about 16 out of 100 pregnant women developed Long COVID compared with about 19 out of 100 non-pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long COVID is defined as having any of the following symptoms: cognitive problems, encephalopathy, sleep disorders, acute pharyngitis, shortness of breath, pulmonary fibrosis, chest pain, diabetes, edema, malnutrition, joint pain, fever, malaise and fatigue. Similar findings were replicated in the N3C cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Though we observed that pregnant women have a significant risk of Long COVID, it was surprisingly lower than those who were not pregnant when they had SARS-CoV-2 infection,” Dr. Zang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, some subgroups seemed especially vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Groups at Higher Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the pregnant women, the researchers found that certain groups had higher Long COVID risks than others. For example, pregnant women who identified as Black, or were of advanced maternal age (age 35 or older at delivery), or had obesity or other metabolic conditions were more likely to develop Long COVID than pregnant women who weren’t part of these groups. However, this risk was still lower than their matched non-pregnant controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further research on factors such as inequitable healthcare access, socioeconomic factors and structural racism may help us understand the elevated Long COVID risk in these groups and find ways to protect them,” said Dr. Zang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hypothesize that the altered immune and inflammatory environment lasting about six weeks after giving birth might contribute to lowering the risk of Long COVID,” Dr. Zang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The observed risk differences in this analysis suggest future dedicated studies of Long COVID in pregnant individuals are needed.” For instance, differences in COVID infection by trimester may be informative for patient counseling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zang and his colleagues at Weill Cornell Medicine are also using electronic health records to study how existing medications may be repurposed to protect pregnant women from Long COVID.               &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was co-led by Dr. Elaine Hill and Dr. Daniel Guth, at the University of Rochester Medical Center; Dr. Torri D.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 44 people with mild cognitive impairment – an intermediate clinical condition between normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease in which cognitive decline is greater than expected for age, indicating a higher risk of dementia. The results showed that strength training not only improved memory performance but also altered brain anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six months of twice-weekly weight training, the participants showed protection against atrophy in the hippocampus and precuneus – brain areas associated with Alzheimer’s disease – as well as improvements in parameters that reflect the health of neurons (white matter integrity).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We already knew that there would be physical improvement. Cognitive improvement was also imagined, but we wanted to see the effect of weight training on the brains of older people with mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study showed that, fortunately, weight training is a strong ally against dementia, even for people who are already at high risk of developing it,” says Isadora Ribeiro, a FAPESP doctoral fellowship recipient at UNICAMP’s School of Medical Sciences (FCM) and first author of the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was carried out within the framework of the Brazilian Institute for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology (BRAINN) – a FAPESP Research, Innovation and Dissemination Center (RIDC) – and is the first to demonstrate what happens to the integrity of the white matter of individuals with mild cognitive impairment after weight training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As well as neuropsychological tests, we also performed MRI scans at the beginning and end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results are very important because they indicate the need to include more physical educators in the public health system at the primary health care level since increased muscle strength is associated with a reduced risk of dementia. It’s a less complex and cheaper treatment that can protect people from serious diseases,” comments Marcio Balthazar, BRAINN researcher and study supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, the new anti-amyloid drugs approved in the United States indicated for the treatment of dementia and for people with mild cognitive impairment, cost around USD 30,000 a year. That’s a very high cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These non-pharmacological measures, as we’ve shown is the case with weight training, are effective, not only in preventing dementia but also in improving mild cognitive impairment,” the researcher adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protocol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research participants were divided into two groups: half underwent a resistance exercise program with weight training sessions twice a week, at moderate to high intensity and with progressive loads; the other half did not exercise during the study period and were part of the so-called control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the analyses carried out at the end of the intervention, the volunteers who practiced weight training had better performance in verbal episodic memory, improved integrity of neurons and areas related to Alzheimer’s disease protected from atrophy, while the control group showed a worsening of brain parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A characteristic of people with mild cognitive impairment is that they have volume loss in some brain regions associated with the development of Alzheimer’s. But in the group that did strength training, the right side of the hippocampus and precuneus were protected from atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This result justifies the importance of regular weight training, especially for older people,” Ribeiro highlights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researcher believes that a longer period of training could lead to even more positive results than those reported in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All the individuals in the bodybuilding group showed improvements in memory and brain anatomy. However, five of them reached the end of the study without a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, such was their improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This leads us to imagine that longer training sessions, lasting three years, for example, could reverse this diagnosis or delay any kind of dementia progression. It’s certainly something to be hopeful about and something that needs to be studied in the future,” Ribeiro argues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, weight training can protect the brain against dementia on two fronts: by stimulating the production of neural growth factor (an important protein for the growth, maintenance and survival of neurons) and by promoting global disinflammation in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any physical exercise, whether weight training or aerobic activity, is known to increase levels of a chemical involved in brain cell growth. It can also mobilize anti-inflammatory T-cells. This is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After all, the more pro-inflammatory protein that is released in the body, the greater the chance of developing dementia, accelerating the neurodegenerative process and forming dysfunctional proteins that eventually kill neurons,” Balthazar explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess these issues, the volunteers’ levels of irisin and BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) – substances whose synthesis is stimulated by muscle contraction and which are associated with neural protection and synaptic plasticity – were measured. The results are currently being analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a continuation of this study in which we’ll try to better understand how these factors are related to changes in brain anatomy. We believe that it’s a set of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective factors that lead to these changes,” Ribeiro predicts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this aging, exercise, and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c1a9b3a4a8afa4b3b581a7a0b1a4b2b1efa3b3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Heloisa Reinert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://fapesp.br" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FAPESP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Heloisa Reinert – FAPESP&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11357-024-01483-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Resistance training protects the hippocampus and precuneus against atrophy and benefits white matter integrity in older adults with mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt;” by Isadora Ribeiro et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resistance training protects the hippocampus and precuneus against atrophy and benefits white matter integrity in older adults with mild cognitive impairment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to cognitive alterations with preservation of functionality. Individuals with this diagnosis have a higher risk of developing dementia. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical exercise, are beneficial for the cognition of this population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the impact of resistance training (RT) on the brain anatomy of older adults with MCI has not yet been clarified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the effects of RT on cognition and brain anatomy in MCI. Forty-four older adults with MCI, 22 in the training group and 22 in the control group, were evaluated in neuropsychological tests and magnetic resonance imaging at the beginning and end of the study, which lasted 24 weeks. We used repeated measures ANOVA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The training group showed better performance in verbal episodic memory after intervention. The control group showed a decrease in gray matter volume in the hippocampus and precuneus, while the training group showed no reduction in the right hippocampus and precuneus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it showed a decrease in the volume of these regions on the left side and in the left superior frontal gyrus.

Surprisingly, the type of activity—whether social media, movies, or studying—didn’t make a difference; it was the screen time itself that mattered most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe this is due to “time displacement,” where screens delay sleep by taking up rest time. The study suggests turning off screens at least 30–60 minutes before bed to protect sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;59% Insomnia Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; One extra hour of screen time after bedtime raises insomnia odds by 59%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time, Not Type:&lt;/strong&gt; All screen activities disrupt sleep equally, regardless of content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lost Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Bedtime screen use shortens nightly sleep by an average of 24 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Frontiers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists have found another reason to put the phone down: a survey of 45,202 young adults in Norway has discovered that using a screen in bed drives up your risk of insomnia up by 59% and cuts your sleep time by 24 minutes. However, social media was not found to be more disruptive than other screen activities. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The type of screen activity does not appear to matter as much as the overall time spent using screens in bed,” said Dr Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, lead author of the article in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108348"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person in bed and a tablet." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The scientists found that increasing screen time after bedtime by one hour increased the odds of insomnia symptoms by 59% and lowered sleep duration by 24 minutes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt; “We found no significant differences between social media and other screen activities, suggesting that screen use itself is the key factor in sleep disruption — likely due to time displacement, where screen use delays sleep by taking up time that would otherwise be spent resting.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night night, sleep tight? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is critical to our mental and physical health, but many of us don’t get enough. At the same time, an increasing number of people are accustomed to using screens in bed, which may be associated with poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screen use is thought to impact sleep in four ways: notifications disturb sleep, screen time replaces sleeping time, screen activities keep you wakeful so you take longer to fall asleep, or light exposure delays circadian rhythms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sleep problems are highly prevalent among students and have significant implications for mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being, but previous studies have primarily focused on adolescents,” said Hjetland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the widespread use of screens in bed we aimed to explore the relationship between different screen activities and sleep patterns. We expected that social media use might be more strongly associated with poorer sleep, given its interactive nature and potential for emotional stimulation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the scientists used the 2022 Students’ Health and Wellbeing survey, a nationally representative study of Norwegian students. They reached 45,202 participants in full-time higher education, aged between 18-28 years old.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They first asked participants to say whether they used screens after going to bed and for how long. Then they asked participants to identify their chosen activities: watching shows or movies, gaming, social media, surfing the internet, listening to audio like podcasts, or reading study-related materials.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were also asked to report their bedtime and rising time, as well as how long it took them to fall asleep, how often they had trouble falling or staying asleep, how often they felt sleepy during the day, and how long their sleep problems persisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insomnia was defined as trouble sleeping and daytime sleepiness issues at least three times a week over at least three months.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists then sorted responses into three categories: one where participants said they only used social media, one where participants did not mention social media, and one where participants selected several activities, including social media.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All-nighters &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that increasing screen time after bedtime by one hour increased the odds of insomnia symptoms by 59% and lowered sleep duration by 24 minutes. However, using social media wasn’t more detrimental than other screen activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no significant interaction between the time spent using a screen and the choice of activity, suggesting that the activity itself didn’t affect the amount of time people stayed awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This indicates that screens reduce sleep time because they displace rest, not because they increase wakefulness: different activities would be expected to affect wakefulness differently.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you struggle with sleep and suspect that screen time may be a factor, try to reduce screen use in bed, ideally stopping at least 30–60 minutes before sleep,” suggested Hjetland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you do use screens, consider disabling notifications to minimize disruptions during the night.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists cautioned, however, that their study focuses on a single culture. There could be notable differences in the relationship between screen use and sleep globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, to compare social media use with other screen activities, some activities which could have different effects on sleep — such as listening to music or gaming — were included in a single category.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study cannot determine causality — for example, whether screen use causes insomnia or if students with insomnia use screens more,” noted Hjetland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study also did not include physiological assessments, which could provide more precise insights into sleep patterns.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f68684938585b690849998829f9384859f98d8998491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Angharad Brewer Gillham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://frontiersin.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frontiers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Angharad Brewer Gillham – Frontiers&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1548273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;How and when screens are used: Comparing different screen activities and sleep in Norwegian university students&lt;/a&gt;” by Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland et al. &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How and when screens are used: Comparing different screen activities and sleep in Norwegian university students&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Screen use in bed has become a widespread habit, particularly among young people. This behavior has been associated with poor sleep, with some studies indicating that social media use may be especially detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is a scarcity of research directly comparing the relationship between various screen activities and sleep, and most existing studies focus on adolescents rather than young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aims to explore the relationship between screen use in bed and sleep among students, specifically comparing social media use to other screen-based activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; This study utilized data from the cross-sectional Students’ Health and Wellbeing Study of 2022 and included n=45,202 participants aged 18-28 years. Regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between screen time in bed and sleep, comparing social media use with other activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; A one-hour increase of screen time after going to bed was associated with 59% higher odds of having symptoms of insomnia and a reduction in sleep duration of 24 minutes. The associations between screen time and sleep outcomes did not differ for social media use versus other activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent of screen time, participants who exclusively used social media had lower odds of insomnia and longer sleep duration compared to those engaging in other activities or a mix of activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion:&lt;/strong&gt; The present study found that increased screen time in bed is linked to poorer sleep, across activity type. Future research should refine classifications, assess specific content, and employ experimental approaches to determine causal mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:22:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTFBydElTRUc5UGZSLVZqTVFPc0ZsZHZJSjFZRGlJX1N6YklRemhVdmRYcmpMMmxoWTBBbzlYSENrdVpiaThuYkJHSHFSYUtzSE5KVHc3dkJFT1NQczR4Y2s5VG55THU0M0U</guid></item><item><title>Your zip code could determine if you develop a deadly heart condition… what's the risk where you live? - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxQcXhFZWVwa3BUcTFhU1dpZDV3anhWSVliVVhpWlJkYi1oaE9GZ2dzSWdEbXlkS1QtOU55bGlvVG96VG5nWnhoOEg1anhvTW95M0h5R3h2LTdvNzQwcFUxdVo4ck1IZ2t5X2hhY0hSTTJ3R3ZQTjhSZUc0RVM0TDB0UXFxMFVFTEVnd1Awa0dmcHA0Q3NwWExCbjRwTHPSAaIBQVVfeXFMT1dFRTBUTkdaNVN5MjFnTDI4cXVDR21QNXlJN1NqbXJPUm84UEltOWViY21jcXZNak9QNVBXTXhrSUVJSWNLT0sydy1SUFc0TmYzdWtIdU1LTTB6aGxhM2Y1S2VnZkVhb1lqYkZvUjJpbnBNZWluVGhMVDl0SHhpWE9rQkZwZVJfQmNkUVZLT0wtV2hxOC1PZXdKdjF5OUlWQXhB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Living in rural America may be increasing your chances of developing heart disease and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-cc498d60-0e6a-11f0-b85f-af5a12500c95" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite many believing living in open spaces with less pollution is better for a person's health, a new study has revealed that may not be true. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-667a1570-0f07-11f0-b814-0181101fa1a1"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/missouri/index.html" id="mol-667a3c80-0f07-11f0-b814-0181101fa1a1"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; measured the risk rural residents had compared to urban residents for six different &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13023639/Why-not-just-HIGH-blood-pressure-worry.html"&gt;cardiac risk factors, including high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and hyperlipidemia - high levels of fats in the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, rural Americans had an increased risk of developing five of the six conditions - no increased risk was observed for stroke - including a 19 percent higher risk of high blood pressure and a 27 percent higher risk of obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, results showed a 12.5 percent higher risk of diabetes; a 36 percent higher risk of heart disease; and a nine percent higher risk of hyperlipidemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All of these conditions are major risk factors for multiple cardiovascular diseases that could be deadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research team, which was funded by the NIH, found that poverty, education level, food insecurity and home ownership were the major factors driving the differences among both groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Living in rural America may be increasing your chances of developing heart disease and diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the 2020 census, 265million Americans (80 percent) live in urban areas and 66million (20 percent) live in rural areas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2832034?guestAccessKey=f5a44008-a1f5-4397-b878-591c509b6771&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=033125"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published in JAMA Cardiology, analyzed data taken from the 2022 National Health Interview Survey of 27,200 adults over the age of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the respondents, 4,250 (14 percent) lived in rural areas, 14,740 (55 percent) lived in small/medium metro areas and 8,175 (31 percent) lived in urban areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants were asked to fill out questionnaires that inquired about their health insurance coverage, how often they visit the doctor, lifestyle factors including smoking habits and physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were also asked their household income, education level, food insecurity and whether they owned a home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The responses were then evaluated to predict a person's likelihood of developing hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed people living in rural America had a 37 percent chance of developing hypertension and a 29 percent chance of developing hyperlipidemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also had a 41 percent chance of being obese, a nearly seven percent chance of developing CHD and an 11 percent chance of having diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, city-dwellers only had a 31 percent likelihood of developing hypertension, 27 percent chance of hyperlipidemia, 30 percent chance of being obese, a four percent chance of having CHD and 10 percent likelihood of being diabetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No differences were observed for stroke prevalence or risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only group that saw urbanites and suburbanites have an increased risk over rural Americans was 20- to 39-year-olds for hyperlipidemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who live in rural areas in the south are at the highest risk of four of the six indications measured - high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rural Americans in the northeast, however, have the highest risk of heart disease and obesity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'The finding that rural-urban cardiovascular health disparities were largest among young adults is alarming, particularly against the backdrop of rapidly worsening cardiovascular health in this population.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Multiple studies have found there is a health discrepancy across the nation, with the southern region in particular experiencing poor health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 38million Americans have diabetes. According to the Rural Health Information Hub, rural areas are more likely to have higher percentages of people with diabetes and more rural regions of the US have people with diabetes than urban areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A similar trend is seen with obesity rates and heart disease death rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The left map shows the prevalence of diabetes in urban areas and the right map shows the prevalence of the disease in rural areas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the prevalence of high blood pressure among rural and urban Americans of different age groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the prevalence of obesity among rural and urban Americans of different age groups (dark blue represents urban; medium blue represents suburban; and light blue represents rural)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Previous studies have concluded that inadequate access to healthcare, hospital and doctor offices closures and gaps in insurance coverage all contribute to subpar health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, less physical activity, poor diet and higher smoking rates in southern states, as well as lower income and education attainment, all play a role in declining health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the latest study confirmed, adults residing in rural areas were older, actively smoking, not exercising, had lower i&lt;span&gt;ncomes and levels of education and experienced food insecurity.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of these factors can compound on one another, poor diet can lead to diabetes and obesity, which then raises the risk of high blood pressure and can cause heart disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, in the latest study, having access to healthcare did not factor into the differences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based on their findings, the researchers wrote: 'Concerted efforts to improve socioeconomic conditions across rural America may be critical for addressing the widening rural-urban gap in cardiovascular health.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:08:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQcXhFZWVwa3BUcTFhU1dpZDV3anhWSVliVVhpWlJkYi1oaE9GZ2dzSWdEbXlkS1QtOU55bGlvVG96VG5nWnhoOEg1anhvTW95M0h5R3h2LTdvNzQwcFUxdVo4ck1IZ2t5X2hhY0hSTTJ3R3ZQTjhSZUc0RVM0TDB0UXFxMFVFTEVnd1Awa0dmcHA0Q3NwWExCbjRwTHPSAaIBQVVfeXFMT1dFRTBUTkdaNVN5MjFnTDI4cXVDR21QNXlJN1NqbXJPUm84UEltOWViY21jcXZNak9QNVBXTXhrSUVJSWNLT0sydy1SUFc0TmYzdWtIdU1LTTB6aGxhM2Y1S2VnZkVhb1lqYkZvUjJpbnBNZWluVGhMVDl0SHhpWE9rQkZwZVJfQmNkUVZLT0wtV2hxOC1PZXdKdjF5OUlWQXhB</guid></item><item><title>Washington misuses COVID funds, then plays victim - MyNorthwest.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPd18wSzUyaUpSbEhLcnFiSW4tX296MXRJZERZRXJsVUJtMjAtamRYUXM4RklnWVBtZjZYVWtOcnNMTm9WZTRuSG1fQnVWSHR5aHZsYXdiT2w5Y3FUTWFfTHhvVmZrdG5ocHhQZDI1N2h4eWF6V0lHQW9MeHJpeFQtX1V3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story_body"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Washington Democrats decried the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Trump administration for cutting grants to health programs. But you’re not getting the full story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Nick Brown joined a coalition of 24 states this week in suing the HHS and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., for terminating billions in public health grants to the states. Brown, in a statement, said Washington will lose $159 million from the grant cancellations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Brown and left-wing media outlets are leaving out is that the funds in question were for COVID-19 pandemic-related programs. The state of Washington just kept using federal funds for other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The cut funds were for COVID-19, but Washington used them elsewhere&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement to “The Jason Rantz Show” on KTTH, a Washington Department of Health (WA-DOH) spokesperson acknowledged that the grants targeted are “pandemic-related grants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This funding has been essential in supporting critical public health systems, including disease monitoring, reporting, and vaccine efforts for COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses,” the spokesperson explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington Democrats and the WA-DOH say the cuts put critical health programs in deep jeopardy. Perhaps. But it’s 2025. We’re years passed the COVID-19 pandemic, so why would the state continue to receive or expect COVID-related grant dollars?&lt;/p&gt;
                            
                        
&lt;h3&gt;Here are some COVID programs that lost funding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may support how the dollars are being spent, but they’re not going towards their intended purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, $20 million in funding for COVID-19 vaccine immunizations was rescinded. This impacts 46 full-time employees that we’re supposed to pretend are hard at work offering COVID-19 vaccines to the public. Another $3 million was cut from initiatives to address COVID-19 health disparities among high-risk and underserved populations. COVID-19 has developed into a cold. This is not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these programs were pushed into work well outside of the COVID-19 pandemic. And they may be worthy of funding. But the state should pay for it itself &lt;em&gt;or &lt;/em&gt;apply for relevant grants from the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Washington was misusing funds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pandemic is long over. These funds are no longer necessary, yet the state kept accepting the funds as if they would be here forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can argue that the mechanism by which the funds were cut is illegal. Perhaps it is. But the public is being sold misinformation from Democrats and their media allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ll have you think that it’s the Trump administration that’s stealing from health programs when the reality is that it was the WA-DOH that was effectively stealing from the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-brussels-sprouts-can-improve-heart-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Brussels Sprouts Can Improve Heart Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Rich in Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is an important nutrient that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7871141/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-don-t-eat-enough-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;many of us don’t get enough of&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And Brussels sprouts are loaded with it. One cup of Brussels sprouts packs 6 grams of filling fiber, helping you get the recommended 25 to 38 grams you need each day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, we usually think of fiber for digestive health. However, research finds that its beneficial impact on gut health may indirectly enhance cardiovascular health. For instance, one study found that fiber-rich diets may lead to favorable changes in gut bacteria that help lower blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How does that happen? Like the rest of us, your good gut bacteria need food to survive. In the case of your gut microbes, that food is fiber. But fiber is not just about nourishing your good gut bacteria. After gut microbes eat fiber, they produce beneficial compounds called short-chain fatty acids, which are believed to improve heart health by decreasing blood pressure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Vitamin K &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7914418/what-is-vitamin-k/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin K&lt;/a&gt; may not get as much attention as other vitamins. Yet, when it comes to heart health, it should. Conveniently, Brussels sprouts are one of the very best sources of this heart-supporting vitamin. One cup of cooked Brussels sprouts gives you two-and-a-half times the vitamin K you need per day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What makes this often-overlooked vitamin so beneficial for your heart? For starters, vitamin K is a key nutrient for healthy arteries, says Natker. According to the National Institutes of Health, there also seems to be a connection between increased calcification of arteries and insufficient vitamin K intakes. However, experts still aren’t sure exactly why.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In the meantime, adding more vitamin K-rich foods, like Brussels sprouts, to your plate could be a smart move for your heart. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just know that vitamin K can interact with certain medications, especially blood thinners. So, if you are taking blood-thinning medication, speak with your health care provider before increasing your intake of these vitamin K-rich veggies.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Nitrates    &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In nutrition circles, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8048704/new-study-are-nitrates-bad-for-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nitrates&lt;/a&gt; are a controversial subject. So, you might be surprised to learn that research has found that natural nitrates in vegetables, like Brussels sprouts, may benefit your heart.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; How so? When we eat foods containing natural nitrates, our bodies convert them into a compound called nitric oxide that helps expand our blood vessels. This, in turn, allows blood to flow freely, lowering blood pressure and improving circulation. Research suggests the combination of nitrates and vitamin K may explain why cruciferous vegetables such as Brussels sprouts have a blood pressure-lowering effect.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Vitamin C &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Did you know that Brussels sprouts are one of the best vegetable sources of&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-c-vegetables-8768521" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;? One cup of cooked Brussels gives you nearly an entire day’s worth of this antioxidant vitamin. That’s not just good news for your immune system. Vitamin C plays a role in combating free radicals in the body that wreak havoc on your heart health and lead to conditions like atherosclerosis. And there’s more. Like dietary nitrates, vitamin C can also increase your body’s nitric oxide production to keep blood flow smooth and steady.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Potassium  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Last but certainly not least, potassium is another nutrient in Brussels sprouts that keeps your heart in top shape. Unfortunately, most of us aren’t consuming enough of it. Brussels sprouts can help. One cup of cooked Brussels sprouts packs roughly 10% of the Daily Value of this under-consumed mineral. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s encouraging news for your heart, as potassium is a key player in blood pressure regulation. It works by offsetting the blood pressure-raising impact of sodium (which, conversely, most of us eat too much of). In addition to helping lower blood pressure for people with hypertension, it may also protect against heart disease and stroke, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you’re already a Brussels sprout lover or could use some fresh, new ideas, these tips can help.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roast or Pan-Fry in EVOO. &lt;/strong&gt;Lavie is a big fan of olive oil for its heart-healthy benefits. While a simple side of Brussels roasted with olive oil is always a win, these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/maple-balsamic-roasted-brussels-sprouts-7971693" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Maple-Balsamic Roasted Brussels Sprouts&lt;/a&gt; will take yours to the next level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toss into Salads. &lt;/strong&gt;Pre-shredded Brussels sprouts are an easy way to up the nutrition ante of your salad. Next time you’re grocery shopping, grab a bag to add to a simple &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8067520/shaved-brussels-sprouts-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;spring salad&lt;/a&gt;, a hearty &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/255761/apple-fig-brussels-sprouts-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Apple, Fig &amp;amp; Brussels Sprouts Salad&lt;/a&gt; or Giada De Laurentiis’ famous &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/giada-de-laurentiis-roasted-broccoli-brussels-sprouts-salad-8421678" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Roasted Broccoli &amp;amp; Brussels Sprouts Salad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprinkle on Pizza and Tacos. &lt;/strong&gt;Mix up pizza or taco night with a generous topping of shaved Brussels on your pie or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7868380/chicken-tacos-with-brussels-sprouts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;tacos&lt;/a&gt;, says Natker.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Them Crunchy! &lt;/strong&gt;Whether it’s our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8002566/crispy-roasted-brussels-sprouts-with-panko/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;Crispy Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Panko&lt;/a&gt; or a sheet pan of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7887813/crispy-smashed-brussels-sprouts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="7"&gt;Crispy Smashed Brussels Sprouts&lt;/a&gt;, they’re filled with crispy, crunchy goodness. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Up the Barbecue. &lt;/strong&gt;Brussels sprouts are fantastic grilled. And you don’t even need to cut them! Simply toss whole Brussels sprouts with olive oil, salt, pepper and your favorite seasonings. Then, thread them onto a skewer or pop them into a grill basket and barbecue them for a flavorful twist for your next cookout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enlist Your Air Fryer. &lt;/strong&gt;You’ll be amazed by the results! Use this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/277262/air-fryer-brussels-sprouts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="8"&gt;air-fryer Brussels sprout recipe&lt;/a&gt; as a road map—minus the bacon (we love bacon as much as anyone, but when heart health is a goal, less is more).  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Brussels sprouts may not get as much attention as other vegetables. But heart-health experts think they should. These hearty, cruciferous veggies serve up heart-friendly fiber, nitrates, potassium and vitamins K and C. And there are a surprising number of tasty ways to prepare them! Whether they’re roasted, grilled, air-fried or tossed onto pizzas, tacos or salads, it’s time to say goodbye to Grandma’s plain, boiled Brussels sprouts and hello to better heart health!

It's going to help with antioxidants, which are a good thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who might not enjoy eating fish, Whyte encouraged giving it a try, as there are a variety of "healthy fish" that can be cooked in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It really is a superfood, and that's an easy step that people can take," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight gain can often occur due to "mindless" snacking, which often involves unhealthy options, according to Whyte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You buy foods that you're trying to avoid, so we have to stop doing that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor suggested swapping out common snacks like chips and cookies for &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthier choices;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthier choices&lt;/a&gt; like sliced vegetables and hummus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Weight gain can often occur due to "mindless" snacking, which most likely involves unhealthy options, according to Whyte.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Try to focus on some unsalted mixed nuts," he recommended. "Prepare those healthy snacks so you have them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key step to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy eating;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy eating&lt;/a&gt; is preparation, Whyte added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're hungry, you eat what's available," he said.

This is not to make you feel hopeless but to adjust your expectations and help you give yourself grace. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In many instances, depression is a system shutdown following a period of overwhelm that allows your brain and body to reset and regenerate ― even though it feels terrible while it is happening,” Amorosi explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the same time, some steps can lessen the likelihood:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know the early warning signs and get proactive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Being able to recognize that a depression attack is coming — to the extent you’re able to — can be super helpful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few early signs include mood dips, increased self-criticism and a desire to withdraw, according to Shields. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Tracking these patterns through journaling or mindful check-ins can help you intervene early,” she said. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anxiety-hack-soften-gaze-calming-effect_l_664f4db1e4b042129b89d6a6" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Small grounding techniques" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b89e4be4b09eb937701e33" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="664f4db1e4b042129b89d6a6" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Small grounding techniques&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, such as changing your environment or engaging in self-soothing activities, can prevent escalation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address unresolved emotional struggles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Think about any underlying issues that may make you more likely to experience a depression attack. For example, maybe you need to work through a past trauma in therapy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Many depression attacks stem from unprocessed emotions,” Shields said. To untangle them, she encouraged therapy, creative expression and reflective practices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat yourself like you would on a sick day or day off.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is another way to get on top of a depression attack before it comes. Amorosi encouraged sleeping and resting, feeding yourself well, maintaining hygiene practices, connecting with others and seeking out what feels good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If and when you experience a depression attack, you can manage it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Don’t panic,” Amorosi said. “You are still in control of yourself, you can still take care of yourself and you will feel better soon.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She and Shields shared their best tips:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Simply calling a depression attack what it is (with self-compassion) can make a difference. According to Shields, it creates psychological distance and is a way to remind yourself it’s temporary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage your body.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Depression attacks cause a “freeze” response, Shields said, making us want to not move. But as you may have heard, activation is often needed before motivation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shields recommended gentle movement (like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hip-flexor-stretch-aging_l_66a8fa85e4b0a3cd43f74797" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="stretching" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b89e4be4b09eb937701e33" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="66a8fa85e4b0a3cd43f74797" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;stretching&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, going outside, taking a deep breath or running your hands under warm water) to get your nervous system out of this mode.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek connection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another unhelpful temptation that often comes with bouts of depression is isolation. You can get out of that rut with even a small act.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If speaking feels too difficult, having a pre-written text, like ‘I’m struggling — can you check in?’ can make reaching out easier in the moment,” Shields said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize routines.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your brain loves consistency.

Whatever your week looks like, try to maintain that schedule.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This part feels really hard, so forcing ourselves into action can help decrease the intensity of the depressive low,” Amorosi said. (So back to the “activation comes before motivation” reminder.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge negative thoughts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During a depression attack, you may have mean, unhelpful thoughts toward yourself or life — which can make you feel even worse. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amorosi recommended challenging thoughts that are judgmental, hateful or fearful, noting this can also help you avoid destructive coping behaviors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Rather than viewing them as personal failures, we can see them as signals pointing to unmet needs, unresolved emotions or nervous system overload,” Shields added. “Healing isn’t about eliminating them entirely but learning how to meet them with awareness and self-compassion.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 11:00:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxOY2g5S21ZLUJpTGJDUmx5aTJ1emFYcW43ME9LeDgyd2dwdWVxVU1CZkxkaXBudVJ1eC04ekJ3RDRUbWZzOGh3TXdTMHJFQkxlMEZXamtMRUZxY1JnRVJvSmZxalZUS0hYenp0Y2ZOcGJqWFJETlFEcUh0TjJEQXhCc0l0YkxraHY0ZmlMbWpkOGtoaVnSAZgBQVVfeXFMT19IRU45VlNYQmNKMzcwQ2lwZWxqcVNpMXZMRC03ZTB3V1F6bm1yQnVLTWxFaDFMdHlfU3NMR3ZIUVA3UFpndjFydlYwNVFHTmMtZHR1UGpGS19uVkExYkt4NE9kM3pCMEw1ak14TDdmMkdYNVJaMGFOeVEwN2RrSmVRU2o4U0NQdFdHM1YwQzFyQ0tIZ0kwRjc</guid></item><item><title>This Startup Says It Can Clean Your Blood of Microplastics - WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNZ1BjNlJrRXNkMkFKUHJLbEpBUmJIbXQ3QjVqM0RIcHlYWEtMczJkSWFPalM0cHRISmNGM3hnODRZTXZ2ZDR3T1FKNmN0ZVo1bVpkUVFDRTctazA1cjhFRTdvcFA3N2RCNEFrQldhb2o3UWhJYjNnY2Rxa1d4LXFiNTVJb3l2MFJfdUgwcFg0M2VlTGRUek9ueGdibkJkM1dqRHktcEZB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;This is a&lt;/span&gt; non-exhaustive list of places microplastics have been found: Mount Everest, the Mariana Trench, Antarctic snow, clouds, plankton, turtles, whales, cattle, birds, tap water, beer, salt, human placentas, semen, breast milk, feces, testicles, livers, brains, arteries, and blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;My blood, specifically. In early March I milked a few drops out of my fingertips and sent the sample to be tested for microplastics. I was in the London office of Clarify Clinics—a firm that offers to cleanse your blood of microplastics, forever chemicals, and other toxins, in treatments that start at £9,750 ($12,636).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Each week around 10 to 15 people walk into the basement clinic just off Harley Street—a road famed for its private clinics and wealthy clientele. After a consultation, the patients settle down in an armchair for the treatment. Blood is drawn from a cannula into a machine that separates out the plasma from blood cells. That plasma is filtered through a column that is supposed to trap microplastics and other undesirable chemicals, before being mixed back with the blood cells and pumped back into the patient. All-in-all the process runs for up to two hours—enough time to process 50 to 80 percent of the blood plasma volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Once it’s running, you feel nothing. It’s very comfortable,” says Yael Cohen, CEO of Clarify Clinic. “Patients take calls, do Zooms, watch movies, sleep. The ones who sleep are my favorite.” They come for all kinds of reasons, Cohen says: Some are suffering with chronic fatigue, others with brain fog or long Covid. The clinic also runs treatments marketed toward people on Ozempic-style weight-loss drugs, looking to conceive, or ward off dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;What Clarify sells them is the hope of easing their symptoms by ridding their blood of microplastics, or other potential contaminants such as PFAS chemicals (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) and pesticides. But the science on how microplastics affect our health is still far from conclusive.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When doctors suspect Alzheimer's, they can order a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/08/02/g-s1-14852/alzheimers-new-blood-tests-amyloid-tau-ptau217-diagnosis" target="_blank"&gt;blood test &lt;/a&gt;to learn whether a patient's brain contains the sticky amyloid plaques that are a hallmark of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the results of that test won't tell the whole story, says &lt;a href="https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/randall-bateman" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Randall Bateman&lt;/a&gt;, a neurology professor at Washington University in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"People can have a head full of amyloid, but no dementia or memory loss," Bateman says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;So he and a team of scientists have developed &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03617-7" target="_blank"&gt;a new blood test&lt;/a&gt; that can show whether Alzheimer's has actually begun to affect a person's thinking and memory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It joins &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03565-2" target="_blank"&gt;another new test&lt;/a&gt;, this one of spinal fluid, that can predict whether the brain changes associated with Alzheimer's are likely to affect cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a strong indicator of memory impairment," says &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/tony-wyss-coray" target="_blank"&gt;Tony Wyss-Coray&lt;/a&gt;, a neurology professor at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Both tests, described in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, could help doctors identify patients who are likely to benefit from &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/03/1235624349/drug-alzheimers-patient-medication-perspective" target="_blank"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; that can clear the brain of amyloid plaques. Both were developed with funding from the National Institutes of Health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Looking beyond amyloid&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The blood test is the result of a search for better Alzheimer's biomarkers — measurable substances in the body that indicate the presence of a disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bateman and his team had been studying tau tangles, the abnormal clumps of protein that form inside the neurons of people with Alzheimer's. These tangles are considered a hallmark of the disease, along with amyloid plaques.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team noticed that one region of the tau protein seemed to play a critical role in damaging neurons and causing memory loss. And they found a biomarker for this region called MTBR-tau243.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Compared with biomarkers of amyloid plaques, MTBR-tau243 "was much more related to memory loss, symptom onset, dementia stage, all the things that patients care about," Bateman says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first, the team had to use spinal fluid to reliably measure levels of the new biomarker. But eventually, they developed a test that could use blood samples.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The blood test indicates how much abnormal tau is in a patient's brain, Bateman says, "and it only goes up when people are symptomatic."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the test becomes available commercially, Bateman says, it will give doctors a fast and easy way to tell whether the amyloid plaques sitting in a patient's brain are actually affecting their memory and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;It will also indicate whether Alzheimer's has progressed past the point where drug treatment is likely to help, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We can now make a much more informed choice about: How much benefit are you likely to get if you undergo a treatment to remove the amyloid plaques?" Bateman says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A measure of synapses&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another new test, this one of spinal fluid, comes from a team led by Wyss-Coray of Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says they set out to answer a simple question related to aging: "Can we find proteins that change if a person's memory is not working well?"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The team studied more than 7,000 proteins in the spinal fluid of more than 3,000 people. Two proteins emerged as potential biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Levels of one protein rose dramatically in people with memory problems, while levels of the other fell sharply.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So we made a ratio between the two, and that ratio turns out to be a very good indicator of whether a person's memory is OK or not," Wyss-Coray says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The ratio also could be used to predict eventual memory loss in people who have a genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In these individuals, [the ratio] goes up 10 to 20 years before they get the actual disease diagnosis," Wyss-Coray says, because that's when the first subtle signs of cognitive impairment appear.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both proteins in the test are involved in regulating synapses, the connections between neurons, says &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/paul-f-worley/2777288" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Paul Worley&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University. So it makes sense that levels of these proteins change when Alzheimer's begins to affect brain function.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The exciting thing here is that this is a process that seems to anticipate the development of cognitive decline 10, 20, 30 years later," Worley says. That means it should be possible to start treatment long before symptoms of Alzheimer's start to appear, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Worley was part of a team that &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/23798" target="_blank"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; how the loss of one of the two proteins used in the test disrupts synapses and leads to memory loss in Alzheimer's. His team also found that people could remain cognitively normal despite amyloid plaques so long as their brains had normal levels of this protein.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The importance of synapses in Alzheimer's suggests that preserving their function — perhaps by increasing levels of this protein — could be one way to treat or prevent the disease, Worley says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The fundamental biology supports that," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Art King knows egg prices nationally have been on a roller coaster ride. They still cost an average of almost three times what they did in July 2023, but not at his farm market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As co-owner of Harvest Valley Farms in West Deer, King has been selling eggs for about $6 per dozen for years, and his prices haven’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He attributes it to producing some of the eggs at his own farm and buying the rest from another small local farm, not a large national egg producer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this has made his prices more competitive with the national average of about $5.90 per dozen, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, King says it also affords some protection from the biggest cause of higher egg prices: avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, smaller farms say they’ve been a beneficiary of rising egg prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small egg producers don’t have giant flocks of chickens concentrated in pens. Most boast free-range, or at least pasture-fed hens, making them less susceptible to a widespread flu outbreak. Egg shortages — caused largely by the killing of entire flocks where the flu is detected — has had less of an effect on smaller producers so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a simple lesson of economics: when the supply goes down, the price goes up,” King said of the national prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s much the same formula at Nature’s Grove Farm near Latrobe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Vlcek, Nature’s Grove co-owner, has kept prices steady, even prior to the pandemic, by joining forces with other local farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We partner with a local Amish farmer who we have known for years, and he grows his own organic grains. He does not source them from another country; we don’t need to worry about the price of pesticides going up. It’s a fairly steady price from year to year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when we are not dependent on government subsidized crops or chemical fertilizers, we are able to offer a true price for our eggs and meat, free from much of the influence of market swings,” Vlcek said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vlcek also attributes a lack of avian flu’s impact on good farming practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you cram 40,000 birds in a hen house, living on top of their own manure, stripped of any green grass, bugs and sunlight, and feed them a ration that is catered to either putting on muscle (for meat chickens) or increasing laying production instead of nutrition, you are putting all the pieces in place that create an immuno-suppressed animal … one dependent on pharmaceutical fixes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vlcek doesn’t know of a single pasture-based operation that has suffered mass losses from avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Nature’s Grove, chickens are raised in pastures and are moved around freely. From his experience, Vlcek has noted poultry that consume grass are far less susceptible to avian influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Chlorophyll is one of nature’s best detoxes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Freehling Farms near Kittanning, where King gets many of his eggs, there is high demand. The family-owned and -operated poultry farm is seeing increased sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are very busy with the increased demand for eggs and chickens. The number of calls, texts and messages that we are answering on a daily basis is the highest I’ve ever seen it,” owner Roger Freehling said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They sell 500 to 600 dozen per week, amounting to 2,000 dozen per month from the farm’s 1,500 hens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Freehling’s, they mainly sell to local markets and smaller farms, such as Harvest Valley and Dilner Family Farms, also in West Deer. Freehling said his farm’s eggs have consistently sold for $4.99 per dozen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;A real threat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding bird flu has required a few extra precautions, even for smaller producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freehling’s birds normally would spend warmer months in pastures, but keeping them away from wild birds — a prime source of avian flu — has required the use of pens, where the hens are housed “loosely,” not crowded together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a very devastating infection and the widest infection in poultry,” said Dr. Suresh Kuchipudi, chair of infectious diseases and microbiology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biosecurity measures, like washing shoes or tires before entering the chicken house and washing hands and wearing protective clothing, are the greatest defense against bird flu, Kuchipudi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter how big or small the farm is or number of flocks. The key is not lapsing on biosecurity. Anything they can do to prevent the virus from entering is the best weapon they have to save their flocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current strategy the U.S. uses to control bird flu is to kill an entire flock if the disease is detected, Kuchipudi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure is supposed to prevent the virus from spreading. Any flock within 5 kilometers of the flock that was destroyed has to undergo regular testing to make sure the infection hasn’t spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014 and 2015, that method worked, and the virus went away. This time is different because the number of viral sources has increased, including animals that have fed on dead birds, and the disease spreading to dairy cattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first infection in cattle was reported in March 2024 in Texas. Since then, the cases in dairy cattle have been increasing to several hundred, with the highest rates in California and Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the number of hens killed that resulted in the loss of egg-laying stocks. Farmers are not able to immediately repopulate. Then, the new birds do not lay eggs immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a loss of productivity and production time,” Kuchipudi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freehling sees small farming as a way to avoid such shortages, “as long as it’s sustaining for the farmer to do so,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small operations don’t have the number of hens mass producers have, but they can be more adaptive with them to meet market demands or guard against infection spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Harvest Valley, there are 27 chickens, and no new chickens have come in for about six months — part of King’s care practices to avoid the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Nature’s Grove, they cut back on their egg-laying hens, but plan to grow their flock this season, Vlcek said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, King said, while egg prices are up, so are the prices for almost everything else. He doesn’t see the price of eggs as much different from the costs of other items from a consumer standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other items have increased, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-average-price-data.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;U.S. Department of Labor Statistics&lt;/a&gt;, since 2019. Bread per pound has increased by about 51%, milk per gallon by about 40%, ground beef per pound by 53% and chicken per pound by 37%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison to those items, he said, eggs aren’t all that expensive, especially when considering their high nutrient value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vlcek said the shortage is less about prices and more about the deplorable treatment of animals that has led to the spread of the bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any time we demonize wildlife and do not stop to question how we raise the birds, it gives us reason to pause,” Vlcek said.&lt;/p&gt;

In each case, the balms offer to rebalance the delicate skin microbiome, leaving it "renewed" and "refreshed". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But while skincare products often claim to be "probiotic", very few, if any, actually contain live bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;What's more, as probiotic skin treatments are classed as "cosmetics" and not medicines, their manufacturers don't have to share the results of any trials that have been conducted on their products, so it's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2v83r5wk" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;difficult to know&lt;/a&gt; how effective they are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The rules around skin care products are very different to the rules around drugs, so claims can be made with less rigorous testing than would be made for a pharmaceutical agent," says Richard Gallo, a dermatologist at UC San Diego School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Most "probiotic" skincare products contain either &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5637/5/2/41" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;prebiotics&lt;/a&gt; – nutrients that feed and encourage the growth of good bacteria on the skin, or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5637/9/3/264" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;postbiotics&lt;/a&gt; – proteins or other products made by beneficial bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"What we are seeing more and more are approaches that try to influence the microbiome," says Bernhard Paetzold, co-founder and chief scientific officer of S-Biomedic, a company that aims to treat conditions by restoring the skin's microbiome through bacterial "transplants".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to Paetzold, the main reason for this is that live bacteria are extremely difficult to keep alive throughout the manufacturing, storing and distribution process.

Most focus on using live bacteria to treat eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis.

Preliminary results suggest that inulin makes the skin more smooth and supple, providing a more favourable environment for beneficial bacteria to thrive. Other studies have shown that slapping on sphingomyelinase, an &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://archive.ph/o/nHXVC/https:/www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15405408" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;enzyme produced by bacteria such as &lt;i id="staphylococcus-thermophilus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococcus thermophilus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – which are commonly found in fermented milk products and yogurt – can boost production of ceramides, which are needed to keep the skin healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However in all cases, large randomised double blind clinical trials – the gold standard of medical research – are needed to confirm whether any of these creams are effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For example a recent review study examined all of the data from clinical trials &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/bjd/article-abstract/182/1/39/6731363" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;conducted to date&lt;/a&gt; and concluded that while "oral and topical probiotics appear to be effective for the treatment of certain inflammatory skin diseases and demonstrate a promising role in wound healing and skin cancer, more studies are needed to confirm these results". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Gallo agrees that more work is needed but is hopeful about the future of the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's moving in the right direction," he says. "We've come to realise as a field that we need to understand what exactly they're doing, and there's a lot of efforts being put into that, as well as other ways to design microbes to help benefit us.

or other causes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Working out for merely two days a week may be enough to keep cancerous tumors and heart diseases at bay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, divided nearly 100,000 people from the UK 37 to 73 years old into three groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The groups included 'active weekend warriors' - people who completed most of their exercise in one or two days; 'active regulars' - those who spread their activity throughout the week and lastly 'inactives' - participants who did not complete 150 minutes of weekly activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers then analyzed seven days worth of physical activity captured by their accelerometer (a device that measures movement), as well as health-related statistics from 2013 to 2015. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The accelerometers captured a range of activities, including walking, jogging, stationary cycling, elliptical exercises, household chores, gardening and leisure activities such as dancing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the data, over 42 percent of participants were classified as weekend warriors, about 24 percent as active regulars and nearly 34 percent as inactive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The collected data was then evaluated on how different physical activity patterns may affect the risk of dying from all causes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk for each condition was deduced using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision - a global system for medically coding causes of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to the inactive group, the weekend warrior and active regular groups had a significantly lower risk of death from all causes, cardiovascular disease and cancer if they completed 150 minutes of physical activity a week -  whether it was over two days or throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among participants in the active regular group, the risk of death from all causes was 26 percent lower; the risk of death from cardiovascular disease was 24 percent lower and the risk of death from cancer was 13 percent lower.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the conclusions, Dr Li added: 'This message is encouraging news for busy people who struggle to fit in daily workouts but can manage a concentrated burst of activity on weekends or over a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The research provides reassuring evidence that even sporadic physical activity can have lasting health benefits, making it easier for people to prioritize their well-being amid busy schedules.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;However, despite promising results about weekend workouts, it's important to be mindful of potential injury risks, especially if you haven't been active during the week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercising even twice a week can help strengthen the heart muscles, which improves their ability to pump blood efficiently and thus, lowers the possibility of developing high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also prevent the body from developing type 2 diabetes, mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression, arthritis and cancers including kidney, lung and stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, despite promising results about weekend workouts, it's important to be mindful of potential injury risks, especially if you have not been active during the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Keith Diaz, a physiologist at Columbia University who was not involved in the study, warns weekend warriors may be at a slight risk of musculoskeletal injuries and should practice good measures to prevent damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained in the agency's statement: 'One important caveat to remember is that trying to fit 150 minutes of exercise into just one or two days can be a lot on your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some research suggests that weekend warriors have a slightly higher risk of musculoskeletal injuries compared to those who exercise more regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, the benefits of exercising just on the weekend far outweigh the potential risks. If you are going to be a weekend warrior, make sure you do proper warm-ups and build up and progress to higher volumes of activity over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This will help to reduce your risk of injuries.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Now, scientists may have discovered a biological pathway for how this phenomenon could occur.

            The findings are based on mother-newborn pairs enrolled in the Atlanta African American Maternal-Child Cohort between 2016 and 2018. In urine samples collected from 216 mothers between eight weeks and 14 weeks of gestation at visit one and 145 participants between 24 and 30 weeks’ gestation at visit two, the authors measured eight phthalate metabolites. Participants were around age 24 on average, and their levels of some phthalate metabolites were higher than the average determined by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Within a day or two of birth, the authors collected the babies’ blood via a heel stick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The team found prenatal phthalate levels were associated with lower levels of tyrosine, an amino acid and precursor to the thyroid hormone thyroxine. Thyroxine was also abnormally low in those with in utero phthalate exposure, and low thyroxine has been previously associated with &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothyroidism/symptoms-causes/syc-20350284" target="_blank"&gt;greater vulnerability to illness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0083672905710049" target="_blank"&gt;neurodevelopmental issues&lt;/a&gt; in newborns, the authors said. Tyrosine is also a precursor to the neurotransmitters &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22588-dopamine-deficiency" target="_blank"&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22610-norepinephrine-noradrenaline" target="_blank"&gt;norepinephrine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22611-epinephrine-adrenaline" target="_blank"&gt;epinephrine&lt;/a&gt;, all of which partly contribute to the body’s fight-or-flight response. Low levels of these neurotransmitters can lead to various problems, including anxiety, depression and trouble focusing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z9pev900013b6mfm3qj3jn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Prenatal phthalate exposure was also linked with lower levels of the essential amino acid tryptophan, which converts into 5-hydroxytryptophan (or 5-HTP), which then turns into serotonin. Both 5-HTP and serotonin were also low. Serotonin has &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22572-serotonin#:~:text=Serotonin%20plays%20several%20roles%20in,mania%20and%20other%20health%20conditions." target="_blank"&gt;several critical roles&lt;/a&gt; in the body, including mood regulation, sleep, learning, memory, digestion and the body’s response to stress. Previous research has linked low serotonin with mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, sleep problems, and digestive issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000i3b6mxw72mdzg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These biological changes generally were also linked to lower scores on tests measuring attention and excitability, or the ability to respond to stimuli, in participants’ newborns, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000j3b6m6regklcv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Polyvinyl chloride plastic, a primary use for phthalates, “continues to increase in use globally,” said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of the New York University Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards, who wasn’t involved in the study. “We know already — across not just brain development in babies, but a host of consequences that run from cradle to grave, and womb to tomb — that phthalates, in the form of (a) disease burden due to plastic, cost the US $250 billion annually.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000k3b6mg07dqzn2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This study just adds to a voluminous base of evidence that chemicals used in plastic materials harm human health,” Trasande added. “It’s not really something that we should be debating more actively. The more thoughtful approach would be to actually discuss what we need to do about the use of plastic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000l3b6mcx2k780l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Chemistry Council, which represents chemical companies, said via email that its High Phthalates Panel is “dedicated to promoting the benefits of high phthalates such as DIDP and DINP.” Phthalates with a high molecular weight have seven or more carbon atoms. The study did not measure DIDP (diisodecyl) and DINP (diisononyl phthalate), but some of phthalates identified in the study were high phthalates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000m3b6m065568l7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study has a few important limitations, including the lack of information on participants’ diets or whether their births were vaginal or caesarean, all of which can significantly affect both phthalate exposure and a newborn’s metabolites, the authors said. Additionally, around 10% of participants reported using alcohol while pregnant, while 15% reported using tobacco and 40% reported using marijuana. There were no details collected on frequency, quantity or duration of use of those substances.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000n3b6mxi362f7g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adverse pregnancy outcomes related to environmental contaminants can also be influenced by psychological or social stressors, which the study couldn’t account for.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000o3b6m59o2439u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The sample size is small, of course, (but) it’s a complicated and expensive study to conduct in the first place,” Trasande said. “There may be multiple mechanisms by which phthalates disrupt brain development.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000p3b6m5g222or4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people to be able to avoid exposure to phthalates and other chemicals, experts are calling on manufacturers and policymakers to change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000q3b6m53s4m2sa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m part of the Scientists’ Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty (and we) are actually suggesting banning phthalates as a group because of their demonstrated toxicity and that they can cause effects at very low doses,” said ecotoxicologist Dr. Susanne Brander, associate professor in the department of fisheries, wildlife and conservation sciences at Oregon State University. Brander wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000r3b6mse6ilcva@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some manufacturers are creating new plastic additives they hope are safer, but it’s possible they could be as problematic as what we’re using now, Trasande said. “The burden needs to be on the manufacturers to prove that materials … are proven safe before they’re used.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000s3b6mvywd83qf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the meantime, people can reduce their exposure to phthalates by using glass, stainless steel or cast iron and not using nonstick cookware or microwaving or dishwashing plastic materials, Trasande said. “Microwave safe” means the container will be OK, not your food — since it can absorb microscopic particles, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000t3b6mwdqfsus7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When buying personal care products, look for those labeled “phthalate-free” and check ingredient lists, Liang said. Phthalates may be listed as DEP (diethyl phthalate), DBP (dibutyl phthalate) or BBzP (butyl benzyl phthalate). You can use the Environmental Working Group’s &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/" target="_blank"&gt;SkinDeep database&lt;/a&gt; to check which chemicals a product may contain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000u3b6me2igy6tu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Since phthalates can be found in household dust, improving air circulation and regular cleaning with a damp cloth can help,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            Phthalates — &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/12/health/plastic-chemical-early-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;the synthetic chemicals&lt;/a&gt; used in everyday products for food packaging, personal care, toys and more — have been linked to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21854843/" target="_blank"&gt;abnormal neurological development&lt;/a&gt; in infants.

            Now, scientists may have discovered a biological pathway for how this phenomenon could occur.

            Prenatal phthalate exposure was also linked with lower levels of the essential amino acid tryptophan, which converts into 5-hydroxytryptophan (or 5-HTP), which then turns into serotonin. Both 5-HTP and serotonin were also low. Serotonin has &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22572-serotonin#:~:text=Serotonin%20plays%20several%20roles%20in,mania%20and%20other%20health%20conditions." target="_blank"&gt;several critical roles&lt;/a&gt; in the body, including mood regulation, sleep, learning, memory, digestion and the body’s response to stress. Previous research has linked low serotonin with mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, sleep problems, and digestive issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            These biological changes generally were also linked to lower scores on tests measuring attention and excitability, or the ability to respond to stimuli, in participants’ newborns, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Polyvinyl chloride plastic, a primary use for phthalates, “continues to increase in use globally,” said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of the New York University Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards, who wasn’t involved in the study. “We know already — across not just brain development in babies, but a host of consequences that run from cradle to grave, and womb to tomb — that phthalates, in the form of (a) disease burden due to plastic, cost the US $250 billion annually.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000k3b6mg07dqzn2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This study just adds to a voluminous base of evidence that chemicals used in plastic materials harm human health,” Trasande added. “It’s not really something that we should be debating more actively. The more thoughtful approach would be to actually discuss what we need to do about the use of plastic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000l3b6mcx2k780l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Chemistry Council, which represents chemical companies, said via email that its High Phthalates Panel is “dedicated to promoting the benefits of high phthalates such as DIDP and DINP.” Phthalates with a high molecular weight have seven or more carbon atoms. The study did not measure DIDP (diisodecyl) and DINP (diisononyl phthalate), but some of phthalates identified in the study were high phthalates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000m3b6m065568l7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study has a few important limitations, including the lack of information on participants’ diets or whether their births were vaginal or caesarean, all of which can significantly affect both phthalate exposure and a newborn’s metabolites, the authors said. Additionally, around 10% of participants reported using alcohol while pregnant, while 15% reported using tobacco and 40% reported using marijuana. There were no details collected on frequency, quantity or duration of use of those substances.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Adverse pregnancy outcomes related to environmental contaminants can also be influenced by psychological or social stressors, which the study couldn’t account for.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The sample size is small, of course, (but) it’s a complicated and expensive study to conduct in the first place,” Trasande said. “There may be multiple mechanisms by which phthalates disrupt brain development.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000p3b6m5g222or4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people to be able to avoid exposure to phthalates and other chemicals, experts are calling on manufacturers and policymakers to change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000q3b6m53s4m2sa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m part of the Scientists’ Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty (and we) are actually suggesting banning phthalates as a group because of their demonstrated toxicity and that they can cause effects at very low doses,” said ecotoxicologist Dr. Susanne Brander, associate professor in the department of fisheries, wildlife and conservation sciences at Oregon State University. Brander wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000r3b6mse6ilcva@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some manufacturers are creating new plastic additives they hope are safer, but it’s possible they could be as problematic as what we’re using now, Trasande said. “The burden needs to be on the manufacturers to prove that materials … are proven safe before they’re used.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000s3b6mvywd83qf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the meantime, people can reduce their exposure to phthalates by using glass, stainless steel or cast iron and not using nonstick cookware or microwaving or dishwashing plastic materials, Trasande said. “Microwave safe” means the container will be OK, not your food — since it can absorb microscopic particles, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            When buying personal care products, look for those labeled “phthalate-free” and check ingredient lists, Liang said. Phthalates may be listed as DEP (diethyl phthalate), DBP (dibutyl phthalate) or BBzP (butyl benzyl phthalate). You can use the Environmental Working Group’s &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/" target="_blank"&gt;SkinDeep database&lt;/a&gt; to check which chemicals a product may contain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000u3b6me2igy6tu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Since phthalates can be found in household dust, improving air circulation and regular cleaning with a damp cloth can help,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the National Institutes of Health rebuking many of the grants it terminated last month as “antithetical to the scientific inquiry,” experts say members of the academic community may have both administrative and legal recourse to attempt to restore some or all of their research funding. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIH—which sent about $26 billion to more than 500 institutions or research centers affiliated with colleges and universities in 2024—&lt;a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/03/28/nih-grant-terminations-have-frightening"&gt;mostly targeted projects related&lt;/a&gt; to vaccines and the health of women, racial minorities and members of the LGBTQ+ community, &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200/subpart-D/subject-group-ECFR86b76dde0e1e9dc/section-200.340" target="_blank"&gt;citing a federal regulation&lt;/a&gt; that allows agencies to terminate grants “if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While this provision exists and is broad on its face, there are some guardrails for grantees and steps that can be taken along the way to make sure these were done legally,” Amanda Fuchs Miller, a policy consultant, lawyer and former deputy assistant secretary for higher education programs at the U.S. Department of Education, said at a webinar last week hosted by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. “And if termination does remain,” grantees “are allowed to recover as much as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;Some of those tools—which have already been &lt;a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/02/18/trump-administration-faces-growing-number-lawsuits"&gt;used to challenge other executive attempts to halt or cancel federal funding&lt;/a&gt;—include parsing the particulars of individual grant agreements and pursuing agency-specific appeals processes. Per the NIH, grant recipients who received termination notices have 30 days to ask the agency’s director for a review of the decision. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it’s not clear how long it may take the NIH to hear such a high volume of potential appeals and decide if any grants should be reinstated, especially as its parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, initiated the firings of some &lt;a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/04/01/trump-admin-makes-deep-cuts-hhs-public-health"&gt;10,000 employees Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The delay in actually hearing back on the appeals request is a place of concern,” said Krystal Toups, director of contracts and grants administration for COGR, an association of affiliated medical centers, independent research institutes and research universities.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;And since a new federal budget could pass in September that might include more clear guidelines about federal funding priorities, if researchers want some consideration for continuation of their grants, Toups said they should get their cases in front of the appeals committee “sooner rather than later.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Berg, who served as director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences from 2003 to 2011, said that although appeals have to come from the institutions, grantees “would be insane” not to “push their institutions to appeal everything.” But before this year, Berg said, grant terminations were relatively rare and only reserved for extreme circumstances, so he’s not sure how seriously the Trump-run NIH will review any appeals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is completely unprecedented,” he said. “I have no idea if they intend to treat them as good-faith appeals or deny them all as a matter of course, just as they seem to be breaking the law around everything else.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;h2&gt;Litigation Likely&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond administrative appeals, Berg said the NIH’s justification that it can terminate a grant because it no longer “effectuates agency priorities” will “almost certainly” be litigated. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When a grant is awarded to a university, there are terms and conditions that go with the grant. It’s basically a legal contract,” he said. “The question of whether the rationale they’re giving is actually legal is very much an open question. I don’t think it’s a foregone conclusion that the great majority of the terminations that have been done are in fact legal.” &lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;No lawsuit has been filed over the NIH’s grant terminations yet. But if institutions and their advocates do sue, they could argue that the grant terminations violated statutory requirements, constitutional amendments or the Administrative Procedure Act, which prohibits agencies from enacting “arbitrary” or “capricious” orders, among other possible legal challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The APA argument already swayed a federal judge in Maryland last month to &lt;a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/03/19/judge-orders-education-dept-restore-teacher-prep-grants"&gt;reinstate dozens of teacher-preparation grants&lt;/a&gt; the Education Department canceled because it said the programs, which included diversity, equity and inclusion–related content, were “inappropriate and unnecessary.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/03/06/federal-judge-blocks-nih-rate-cut-nationwide-again"&gt;A federal judge in Massachusetts has also enjoined&lt;/a&gt; the NIH’s recent guidance to cap the amount of money it sends to institutions to cover indirect research costs after a cavalry of Democratic attorneys general, institutions and trade associations argued in a lawsuit that the plan is “arbitrary and capricious,” in violation of the APA. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Samuel Bagenstos, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and general counsel for the HHS from June 2022 to December 2024, said in an email that from the termination notices he’s seen, “many folks who have lost their grants would at a minimum have strong arbitrary-and-capricious claims,” in addition to claims that the termination “violates the law creating the grant program, or violates the grant terms.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond litigating potential APA violations, Ted Waters, managing partner at Feldesman Leifer LLP, who specializes in federal grant programs, said the NIH’s grant termination letters rely on language that doesn’t yet apply to grants administered by the HHS. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the last days of Trump’s first administration in 2020, the Office of Management and Budget amended the federal uniform guidance to include a provision that said a federal grant could be terminated if it “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although there were some attempts to strike that language during the Biden administration, those efforts failed. However, when OMB updated the regulations in 2024, it said agencies must “clearly and unambiguously specify all termination provisions in the terms and conditions” of a federal award. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each individual granting agency then had to adopt the uniform guidance and make any agency-specific changes. But Waters said HHS “never got around” to updating its grant provisions with OMB’s language from 2020 or the 2024 amendments. One day before the deadline, on Sept. 30, &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://links.us1.defend.egress.com/Warning?crId=67ec6b1fd1436eb1c445ff34&amp;amp;Domain=insidehighered.com&amp;amp;Threat=eNpzrShJLcpLzAEADmkDRA%3D%3D&amp;amp;Lang=en&amp;amp;Base64Url=eNoVyUEOwyAMBMAXLaZIvfQ3TgCDlBALu-X7TY6jae5qH6K1VmjTOMj1I-tejHKp_D2caj9uPUkyebjRyYOlkOiWYnojvgo4X-p9CBL2OqE8HSlG8MhozSBqQXP9A9JjJyc%3D&amp;amp;@OriginalLink=www.hrsa.gov"&gt;HHS posted in the &lt;em&gt;Federal Register&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it would wait until October 2025 to adopt the “no longer effectuates the program goals” language it’s now using to justify grant terminations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s the height of arbitrary and capricious,” Waters said, “citing a regulation that doesn’t apply to these particular NIH awards.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although it’s not clear whether a lawsuit may be filed against the NIH over the grant terminations, Waters expects a challenge to come from trade associations rather than individual grantees—like &lt;a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/02/18/trump-administration-faces-growing-number-lawsuits" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/02/18/trump-administration-faces-growing-number-lawsuits"&gt;many of the other lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; filed against the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s generally better if you have a collection of institutions getting one of the national associations to file suit,” he said, noting that individual plaintiffs often have their integrity questioned on issues unrelated to the lawsuit. Instead, when associations file lawsuits, it helps keep the focus on the “the bigger picture” of if the action is lawful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

DiNicolantonio also has many research publications (over 200, as his bio on Penguin Random House &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/2145388/dr-james-dinicolantonio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt;) under his name, and has even testified in front of the Canadian Senate about the harms of added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's also the author of numerous books about nutrition. In 1999, he authored a book about a ketogenic diet called &lt;em&gt;Superfuel&lt;/em&gt;. Recently, he came out with books such as &lt;em&gt;The Longevity Solution&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Immunity Fix&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Mineral Fix&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Obesity Fix&lt;/em&gt;. Because his opinions often go against conventional medical advice, he's a somewhat controversial figure in the medical field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;His most controversial claim is perhaps the one from his book &lt;em&gt;The Salt Fix&lt;/em&gt;. In it, DiNicolantonio claims that salt isn't as bad as experts previously led us to believe. In fact, he urges people to eat more salt, not less, as we've been told before by nutrition experts, writing: "Salt everything!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; eating only 1.5mg of salt per day. They claim that on average, Americans consume too much salt: about 3.5mg a day. 2.3mg should be the very maximum, at least. DiNicolantonio, in turn, claims that people should be eating anywhere from 7.5mg to 15g of salt a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does too much salt do to us, exactly? "Significant evidence links excess sodium intake with high blood pressure, which increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and heart failure," The American Heart Association writes. They also address new research, which DiNicolantonio probably uses to base his claims on. The AHA says that often, such research is flawed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[It includes] inaccurate sodium intake measurements and an emphasis on studying people who are sick rather than the general population," the AHA writes. "Often, the studies with paradoxical findings are poorly designed to examine the relationship between sodium intake and health outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some medical experts have even gone as far as to call DiNicolantonio's claims a danger to public health. "By advocating a high-salt diet this book is putting the health of many at risk and it undermines internationally recognised evidence that shows a diet high in salt is linked to high blood pressure, a known risk for heart disease," Prof Louis Levy, head of nutrition science at Public Health England, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/aug/08/a-danger-to-public-health-uproar-as-scientist-urges-us-to-eat-more-salt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;told The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;          &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-18"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medical experts point out that you can't ignore the evidence: the rates of heart disease have lowered. "We've got all the epidemiology, migration studies, treatment trials, mortality trials and now outcome trials in countries," Graham MacGregor, professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Wolfson Institute, Queen Mary University of London, added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Finland has reduced salt. The UK has and there have been big drops in heart deaths. You can't really argue against the importance of salt but you always get one or two people who deny it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-21"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of DiNicolantonio's claims is that sugar is far worse for us than salt. Instead of making salt the evil of all our ailments, we should blame added sugars. Salt, according to him, is an essential nutrient that we need. And that might be the only thing other experts in the medical community agree with him on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-24"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underconsumption of salt can lead to serious health issues as well. One study &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27216139/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that people who consumed less than 3mg of sodium per day were more likely to pass away or have heart disease than those who consumed 4-5g. Still, experts worry that DiNicolantonio takes the possibility of salt underconsumption to an extreme and view his recommendation to eat more salt as dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-27"&gt;&lt;p&gt;DiNicolantonio also has some other &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/James_DiNicolantonio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;problematic allegations&lt;/a&gt; against him, such as being a cholesterol denialist (he says that high blood cholesterol levels do not increase the risk of heart disease) and claiming that seed and vegetable oils cause cancer, heart disease, inflammation, and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-30"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Panda is no doctor, but she thinks it's always best to consult with your own doctor when it comes to making drastic changes in your diet and lifestyle.

Without insurance, he was hesitant to see a doctor, but when he did, he was shocked to learn that that persistent sore throat was actually cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p402_premium"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Squamous cell carcinoma they told me,” the Humboldt man said. “I couldn’t believe it. I was upset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMFI_Article_300x250"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Lane, the cancer invaded his jaw, back of his tongue, his throat, and lymph nodes. He underwent six weeks of chemotherapy and seven weeks of radiation at the Norma Schmoker Cancer Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank God it’s over,” said Lane who had his last treatment on Dec.17, the 21st anniversary of his wife, Deb Stanberg Lane, passing from breast cancer. “That was a big day.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral, head, and neck cancers are twice as likely to be found in men than in women, though they are also diagnosed more often among people over the age of 50 than they are in younger adults. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Rod Lane, of Humboldt, loves to ride his motorcycle but after chemotherapy and radiation treatment for squamous cell carcinoma, he sometimes feels that he doesn’t have the strength to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most Americans don’t know the early symptoms of oral, head and neck cancer, and most symptoms are easy to ignore or go completely unnoticed,” said Dr. Sarah Tofilon, medical oncologist at McFarland Clinic, who also practices at UnityPoint Health – Norma Schmoker Cancer Center. “These cancers often go undiagnosed until the later stages, after it has begun to spread. It’s through routine medical or dental exams that early symptoms are often spotted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMFI_Article2_300x250"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free screenings for oral, head and neck cancer will be provided from 3 to 6 p.m. April 17 at Iowa Central Community College’s Applied Science Technology building. Providers with UnityPoint Health — Norma Schmoker Cancer Center and the Iowa Central Community College Dental Hygiene program have partnered to provide the painless screenings at no charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wish I had had screenings like this,” said Lane. “Get checked. Do the screening. I don’t want anyone to have to experience what I’ve gone through.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Tofilon, every adult should be screened for oral,  head and neck cancer, especially tobacco and alcohol users as they tend to be at greatest risk. Medical research is also finding that throat cancer cases are on the rise in younger adults who do not smoke due to the increasing rate of infection with  human papillomavirus, a potentially cancer-causing infection. Nearly 70 percent of the cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed in the United States this year will be attributed to HPV infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“HPV-related throat cancer is more difficult to detect because it usually occurs on the back of the tongue or on the tonsils,” said  Tofilon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Rod Lane sits with his younger sister, Jody during one of his treatments at the Norma Schmoker Cancer Center. Lane was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The April 17 screenings are available at no cost, are painless, and take approximately 15 minutes. Appointments can be made by calling 515-574-6183. Walk-ins are also welcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hope everyone takes advantage of the screenings,” said Lane, who is anxiously awaiting results from his PET scan next week. Those results will determine if he is cancer-free or if the squamous cell carcinoma has metastasized. “Don’t wait until it’s too late.”&lt;/p&gt;

As of 2024, about one in nine people aged 65 and older were living with the disease in the U.S.—that’s almost 7 million Americans. Unfortunately, there isn't a cure for Alzheimer’s. And while some researchers are looking for solutions, others are focusing their efforts on ways to prevent the disease from developing in the first place—or at least slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we know that no one food is a magic solution for any disease, some foods can be heavy hitters when it comes to disease prevention. For a recent study, researchers in South America and Denmark got together and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on kefir, a kind of fermented milk that originated in the Balkans and Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team chose to look deeper into kefir because there is evidence that a healthy gut microbiome may play a role in Alzheimer’s disease prevention. We know that foods like kefir contribute probiotics, those gut-loving bacteria. And it turns out, kefir contributes more than just that. These researchers published their findings in April 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Brain Behavior and Immunity Integrative&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break down what they found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fermented-foods-for-brain-health-8729105" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The 6 Best Fermented Foods for Brain Health, According to Dietitians;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The 6 Best Fermented Foods for Brain Health, According to Dietitians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Was This Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study authors searched research databases for studies that had been done on kefir and neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer’s disease, as well as others, like Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body dementia and Huntington’s disease. They then began whittling down the list of studies to just those that included data on kefir and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They ended up with seven studies—four on rodents (rats and mice), two on fruit flies and one on humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Did This Review Find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several findings surfaced between these seven studies. Specifically, researchers found that subjects who had consumed kefir had:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;less beta-amyloid protein accumulation in the brain (four of the studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;higher antioxidant activity and reduced oxidative damage (five studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;reductions in neuro-inflammation (three studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;lower levels of brain cell death (three studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;enhanced insulin and glucose pathways in the brain (three studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;restoration of the intestinal lining (two studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the human study specifically, kefir was associated with higher levels of antioxidant activity and better performance on several memory tests for people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Study Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This systematic review and meta-analysis included just one human study. Because non-human studies do not always translate to the same results in humans, we cannot say with a high degree of certainty that these results apply to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers note that because kefir can differ in composition, depending on how it’s made, it presents a significant limitation when comparing the results of different studies on kefir’s benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also note that larger, long-term human studies need to be performed to understand the safety and effectiveness of kefir as a complementary therapy alongside drugs taken for Alzheimer’s disease. This means that, based on current research, they cannot confidently say whether kefir is helpful or safe alongside other treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you aren’t concerned about your Alzheimer’s risk, kefir may still be a gut-healthy beverage &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-late-night-drink-for-weight-loss-11696463" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:worth adding to your routine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;worth adding to your routine&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir is a bit more sour-tasting than plain yogurt, but it’s a great addition to smoothies since it doubles as the liquid and is a probiotic. But that’s not all kefir contributes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to these researchers, kefir is also loaded with other healthy components, including protein, unsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates and a wealth of vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, D, E and K, B vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, potassium and zinc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the carbohydrates in kefir are complex carbohydrates, which feed the beneficial bacteria in the kefir and your gut, helping them to thrive and multiply. And if you’re lactose intolerant, there’s a chance your gut can tolerate kefir, since the process of making it reduces the amount of lactose to almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If plain kefir makes you pucker, you can find sweetened, flavored versions of kefir, usually in fruity flavors on the yogurt aisle. Just beware the sugar content, since many flavored varieties average around 8 grams of added sugar in an 8-ounce serving. With that said, if you don’t eat a lot of added sugar, this easily fits within the American Heart Association’s recommendation of limiting added sugar to no more than 25 grams a day for women and 36 grams a day for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kefir also comes in various levels of fat, depending on what type of milk was used to make it—from low-fat to whole-milk. And there are other varieties, including organic, grass-fed and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8032910/a2-milk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A2 kefir made from A2 milk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;A2 kefir made from A2 milk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t do dairy? There’s something for you, too, since kefir can also be made from non-dairy milks. You’re most likely to see non-dairy kefir made from coconut milk, but you may also find it made from soy and oat milks. There’s even &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265892/water-kefir/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:water kefir;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;water kefir&lt;/a&gt; that you can make yourself by purchasing water kefir grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use kefir in any of your favorite smoothie recipes, including options like our &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/257793/berry-kefir-smoothie/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Berry-Kefir Smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Berry-Kefir Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir can be used in place of buttermilk in your favorite baked goods, including pancakes, waffles and muffins. It can also be used as the buttermilk base of dressings, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8045018/homemade-ranch-dressing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ranch dressing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ranch dressing&lt;/a&gt;. Or replace the milk in your mac and cheese recipe with plain kefir for an added probiotic boost. And of course, you can also sip it on its own. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Your Gut Health Affects Almost Every System in Your Body—Are You Doing Enough to Care for It?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Your Gut Health Affects Almost Every System in Your Body—Are You Doing Enough to Care for It? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating probiotic foods like kefir that enhance the gut microbiome is showing promise in playing a positive role in Alzheimer’s disease prevention. However, much more human research needs to be done. Until then, following an eating pattern like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-mind-diet-meal-plan-for-cognitive-health-11700108" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the MIND diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, which includes foods that have been shown to benefit brain health, is a good place to start. Besides fermented foods like kefir and yogurt, the MIND diet is also loaded with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds and healthy fats. It also includes lean proteins like chicken and seafood, and limits ultra-processed foods, red meat, sugar and salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to food, other habits also play a role in brain health. If you smoke, get help to quit. Alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-drink-to-limit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-8743556" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:isn’t great for your brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;isn’t great for your brain health&lt;/a&gt;, so if you don’t drink, don’t start. If you do, limit your intake to no more than one or two drinks a day—though less is probably better. Loneliness is also a risk factor for dementia, so be sure you’re spending time with loved ones on a regular basis. Good sleep and regular exercise can help you out, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that list seems overwhelming, take a deep breath and try improving just one thing at a time. Start with walking around the block a couple of days a week or limiting screen time before bed for better sleep. Small steps can lead to big changes when it comes to your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/kefir-alzheimers-study-11707164" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:05:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBmeHA0RE10NnZsRXdYRmZsTVpzdWdYZGdyTkJNUUpDNGFOSWk2X1ZNeEZjUksxX1B0NGhYeHoydXdnWUpZcTc1YXcwUlRhRHd6S045R2JVZ1RNUUNjSzhlOWZvZHZaR2c2MEJuTUxmellPUElHRUE</guid></item><item><title>Kent County records first measles case in 12 years - WOODTV.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNZVZBaGRyRVFzcEhackhHZU0wcDZBcUoybC1USEVDbllGVG41Q2pkQnBjYmtBNEw4eHFiTnlKVWQxWjBWMmxGOE5DUVY4cmpYczB0bnlvUWFxaG8yWXZlU3hTbXE1dC1ydkJVVHgySTE0ZUFGOVVEUUJLUmxxbWNtcmRwam9reXRuSnZkel9lR0NRYUtiRkHSAZsBQVVfeXFMUDVCSWVvRDQtVjRkNHpBMzc0TE0zLTdXRE1ZYk55MkdFQlFRLVA1ZGlDMGZmanlOMHJMUmdRZFZSTkwzWHNEaHNWWkd6TFZqQ096Uy1aVjBNeEF6TGM3MzUyZDF1TmdUZHNBWFlEVjdSbHpLd3RDWGdJUlZrNW5PeHlHbUdNNHh3TFNnclF3czg2TkN3R3d2d0p0TjQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;More than five years since COVID was &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/covid-19"&gt;declared a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, we’re still facing the regular emergence of new variants of the virus, SARS-CoV-2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest variant on the rise is LP.8.1. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/australian-respiratory-surveillance-reports-2025"&gt;increasing in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, making up close to &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250322.pdf"&gt;one in five COVID cases&lt;/a&gt; in New South Wales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere it’s become even more dominant, comprising at least three in five cases &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/health/lp-covid-variant-cases-future-waves-3598768"&gt;in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is LP.8.1? And is it cause for concern? Let’s look at what we know so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An offshoot of Omicron&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LP.8.1 was first &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;detected in July 2024&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a descendant of Omicron, specifically of KP.1.1.3, which is descended from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-emergence-of-jn-1-is-an-evolutionary-step-change-in-the-covid-pandemic-why-is-this-significant-220285"&gt;JN.1&lt;/a&gt;, a subvariant that caused large waves of COVID infections around the world in late 2023 and early 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) designated LP.8.1 as a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;variant under monitoring&lt;/a&gt; in January. This was in response to its significant growth globally, and reflects that it has genetic changes which may allow the virus to spread more easily and pose a greater risk to human health. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, LP.8.1 has mutations at six locations in its spike protein, the protein which allows SARS-CoV-2 to attach to our cells. One of these mutations, V445R, is thought to allow this variant to spread more easily relative to other circulating variants. V445R has been shown to increase binding to human lung cells in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00015-5/fulltext"&gt;laboratory studies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The proportion of COVID cases caused by LP.8.1 has been rising in New South Wales.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250322.pdf"&gt;NSW Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, the symptoms of LP.8.1 don’t appear &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;to be any more severe&lt;/a&gt; than other circulating strains. And the WHO has evaluated the additional public health risk LP.8.1 poses at a global level to be low. What’s more, LP.8.1 remains a variant under monitoring, rather than a variant of interest or a variant of concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, these changes to the virus with LP.8.1 are small, and not likely to make a big difference to the trajectory of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;That doesn’t mean cases won’t rise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID as a whole is still a major national and international health concern. So far this year there have been close to &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/australian-respiratory-surveillance-reports-2025"&gt;45,000 new cases recorded in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, while around &lt;a href="https://covidlive.com.au/report/daily-hospitalised/aus"&gt;260 people are currently in hospital&lt;/a&gt; with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because many people are no longer testing or reporting their infections, the real number of cases is probably far higher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;COVID is still around.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/asian-traveler-business-man-wearing-face-1739402366"&gt;Hananeko_Studio/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/australian-respiratory-surveillance-reports-2025"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, LP.8.1 has become the &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250322.pdf"&gt;third most dominant strain in NSW&lt;/a&gt; (behind &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/xec-is-now-in-australia-heres-what-we-know-about-this-hybrid-covid-variant-239292"&gt;XEC&lt;/a&gt; and KP.3). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250322.pdf"&gt;has been growing&lt;/a&gt; over the past couple of months and this trend looks set to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say it’s not growing similarly in other states and territories, however NSW Health publishes &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Pages/reports.aspx"&gt;weekly respiratory surveillance&lt;/a&gt; with a breakdown of different COVID variants in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sequences of LP.8.1 in the &lt;a href="https://gisaid.org/"&gt;GISAID database&lt;/a&gt;, used to track the prevalence of variants around the world, increased from &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;around 3%&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2024 to 38% of global sequences as of &lt;a href="https://x.com/Mike_Honey_/status/1905816340331728914"&gt;mid March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some countries it’s climbed particularly high. In the United States LP.8.1 is responsible for &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt;55% of cases&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/health/lp-covid-variant-cases-future-waves-3598768"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt;, where LP.8.1 is making up at least 60% of cases, scientists fear &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/science/new-covid-wave-cases-hospitalisations-3611459?srsltid=AfmBOor_V7pQrPMPhUYQA2KCZgRfsI_CpxTwIRiHDFJHIJhq2kbAmD42"&gt;it may be driving a new wave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="BlueskyEmbed" data-react-props='{"uri":"at://did:plc:cyy3irakdgdbhcdtd4ik6aro/app.bsky.feed.post/3llmzuz457k2m"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Will COVID vaccines work against LP.8.1?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current COVID vaccines, including the most recently available &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/new-covid-vaccines-may-be-coming-to-australia-heres-what-to-know-about-the-jn-1-shots-237652"&gt;JN.1 shots&lt;/a&gt;, are still expected to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;offer good protection&lt;/a&gt; against symptomatic and severe disease with LP.8.1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, due to its designation as a variant under monitoring, WHO member countries will continue to study the behaviour &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;of the LP.8.1 variant&lt;/a&gt;, including any potential capacity to evade our immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there’s no cause for panic due to LP.8.1 variant at this stage, COVID can still be a severe disease for some. Continued vigilance and vaccination, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/getting-your-vaccination"&gt;for medically vulnerable groups&lt;/a&gt;, is essential in minimising the impact of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

But it’s not just a matter of getting enough rest. Sleeping late and less than five hours a day can impact your health in various ways. Dr Dheeraj Kapoor, head of endocrinology at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Mumbai, tells Lata Mishra why getting your daily dose of shuteye is important&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How does poor sleep affect metabolism and blood sugar regulation?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation are two critical factors that contribute to conditions like Type 2 diabetes, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and fatty liver disease. Sleep deprivation, defined as getting less than 7-8 hours of sleep, and disrupted sleep quality, where a person frequently wakes up at night, both increase the risk of metabolic disorders. When sleep is compromised, the body produces excess cortisol, a stress hormone that heightens insulin resistance and increases the risk of diabetes. Additionally, hormonal imbalances occur — ghrelin (the hunger hormone) rises while leptin (which signals fullness) decreases, leading to increased appetite and cravings for high-calorie foods. Sleep deprivation also triggers inflammation and oxidative stress, further contributing to metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Can just one night of poor sleep impact us?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chronic sleep deprivation has a more profound impact, some studies indicate that even one night of poor sleep can elevate cortisol levels which, in turn, increases insulin resistance and the risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why is sleeping less than five hours and going to bed late harmful?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This combination disrupts the body’s circadian rhythm, the internal 24-hour clock that regulates sleep, hormone secretion, and metabolic processes. When sleep duration is too short and occurs too late at night, cortisol production rises, insulin sensitivity decreases, and metabolic disorders become more likely. Night-shift workers and those who regularly stay up late are at higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome due to these disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;If someone gets eight-plus hours of sleep but goes to bed late, are they still at risk for metabolic issues?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. While getting adequate sleep is beneficial, the timing of sleep also matters. Sleeping after midnight disrupts the circadian rhythm which regulates physiological processes, including sleep, hormone secretion, and metabolism. It helps control insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. When disrupted — due to irregular sleep schedules, shift work, or sleeping late — metabolic processes get impaired, leading to increased risks of diabetes and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Do late sleepers tend to have poorer glucose control?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their disrupted circadian rhythms affect insulin function and glucose metabolism. They also tend to have irregular eating patterns, increased cravings for high-calorie foods, and higher cortisol levels, all of which contribute to poor glucose control. Night-time eating habits further exacerbate insulin resistance, increasing the risk of metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What about other disorders like PCOS, fatty liver disease, or high cholesterol? Are they caused by poor sleep too?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Poor sleep affects hormone balance, leading to increased insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction, which play key roles in conditions like PCOS, fatty liver disease, and high cholesterol. Sleep deprivation also promotes weight gain and inflammation, both of which contribute to these metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Can exercise reduce the impact of sleep loss on insulin sensitivity?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Exercise, particularly high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and strength training, can help reduce some of the negative effects of sleep loss by improving insulin sensitivity and metabolic function. However, exercise should ideally be done in the morning, afternoon, or early evening rather than right before bedtime, as late-night workouts can increase adenosine levels and interfere with sleep quality. Also, reducing screen time before bed and avoiding caffeinated drinks can further support better sleep quality and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why does caffeine consumption disrupt sleep more as we age?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that blocks adenosine, a chemical that promotes sleep. As individuals age, the body’s ability to metabolise caffeine slows down, making its effects last longer. Older adults are also more sensitive to sleep disturbances, meaning even a small amount of caffeine consumed in the evening can lead to prolonged wakefulness and fragmented sleep. Additionally, age-related changes in sleep patterns, such as lighter sleep and increased awakenings, make the effects of caffeine more pronounced. It is recommended that older adults reduce caffeine intake in the afternoon and evening to improve sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What are some effective strategies for improving sleep hygiene?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good sleep hygiene involves adopting healthy habits that promote restful sleep. Some effective strategies include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule: Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends, helps regulate the body’s internal clock.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating a comfortable sleep environment: Keeping the bedroom dark, quiet, and cool can enhance sleep quality. Using blackout curtains, white noise machines, and comfortable bedding can help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding stimulants before bedtime: Caffeine, nicotine, and heavy meals should be avoided in the evening to prevent sleep disturbances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engaging in relaxation techniques: Meditation, deep breathing exercises, or light stretching before bed can help relax the mind and body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting regular physical activity: Exercising during the day promotes better sleep, but vigorous workouts should be avoided close to bedtime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9gFBVV95cUxQMW1sWHdqSHdQNkNJT2JtMnI0Y1NwaDBnTDBFT08xOTFGWXVnTUZXX2lrVnIwR2tqMkhjN3gtYzZ2UUR3MzBrdGdnaEV3eWhaRUpXR0daT1B3ZXg0WFptcHhUSTBGMVhGak5zMEZqVklybVIwWXZycWhuMFFXRl9tcDQ0b05meThvQjNLSTd5MWFPQURvbDNValJNVmR2bWgtZTEtd2hXYllWaTNvanoyQUlqXzg0NHpURXJnV1Juak5EYWpwTVBsSV9pTDhoa3hDejBrQ3hlcUVxSjluN0F3Z1hVci1Ib0xMQjRiMDJtWTlKYUk4alE</guid></item><item><title>Kent County sees first measles case in over a decade, exposure locations and dates listed - WZZM13.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1gFBVV95cUxOZ1hnaS1KZXVtcW1ORmNuRkFqOFhIb01zV0toRjRWZXVubnFBMF9jRlQzd1pQM1MxYnEwaW5BNlk0ekNZSTRsSXU0a2R5T0VTNUwxcHBsbjg0WXhCVjNsUW9DdC1FNEVvZjVkT203cE5YUWt2UnpXTVNCbDhMa1JaYTVmS3VWQWU5TU1nTUFXckttWGNfMlFfalFpUG5IZmRKV09RQ0M0eUZaRnBNTXBzZ1cxY0pWSFR2a3FtWlBibzFhRVc0bkRjNFdzaE9wS2ZrRVNHWllR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Kent County confirmed its first measles case in over a decade and listed times and places community members may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KENT COUNTY, Mich. — Kent County hasn't seen a case of seen a case of the measles since 2013, until now.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kent County Health Department said on Tuesday that in partnership with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, they confirmed a case of measles in a Kent County resident.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case in Kent County is Michigan's second case this year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious disease that continues to circulate both in the U.S. and globally," said Dr. Adam London, Health Officer at the KCHD. "This case is a reminder of how quickly measles can spread and the importance of vaccination. We urge residents to check their immunization status and to get vaccinated, especially if planning to travel internationally or into areas with active measles outbreaks."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department said that the infected person is an adult and had recently traveled abroad before returning to the U.S. and traveling between Michigan and New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department listed the following locations where individuals may have been exposed on specific dates:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles can be spread through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves, continuing to infect others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically begin 7-14 days after exposure, according to the health department, though they can surface as late as 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department shared the following list of symptoms to watch for:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul id="isPasted"&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to over 104°F)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums and roof of mouth (Koplik Spots) 2-3 days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on face, spreads to trunk, arms and legs 3-5 days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department advised anyone who was at any of the above locations during the specified times should monitor for these symptoms for 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone experiencing symptoms is urged to call their healthcare provider before seeking in-person care to prevent further spread. The KCHD can be reached Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 616-632-7228. Individuals can call 2-1-1 for support during weekends and evenings.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles can lead to serious complications, especially in young children, pregnant individuals, and those with weakened immune systems," said Dr. Kristin Oldenberg, Medical Director at KCHD. “Fortunately, the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing measles. Two doses of the vaccine provide 97% protection against the disease."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This study suggests that regularly consuming kefir may be beneficial for slowing Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kefir is a versatile fermented food that you can drink by itself or use in recipes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More studies with humans should be done to know if kefir is safe and effective when consumed with drugs for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 60% to 80% of all dementia cases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As of 2024, about one in nine people aged 65 and older were living with the disease in the U.S.—that’s almost 7 million Americans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unfortunately, there isn't a cure for Alzheimer’s. And while some researchers are looking for solutions, others are focusing their efforts on ways to prevent the disease from developing in the first place—or at least slow it down.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we know that no one food is a magic solution for any disease, some foods can be heavy hitters when it comes to disease prevention. For a recent study, researchers in South America and Denmark got together and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on kefir, a kind of fermented milk that originated in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The research team chose to look deeper into kefir because there is evidence that a healthy gut microbiome may play a role in Alzheimer’s disease prevention. We know that foods like kefir contribute probiotics, those gut-loving bacteria. And it turns out, kefir contributes more than just that. These researchers published their findings in April 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Brain Behavior and Immunity Integrative&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Study authors searched research databases for studies that had been done on kefir and neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer’s disease, as well as others, like Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body dementia and Huntington’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They then began whittling down the list of studies to just those that included data on kefir and Alzheimer’s disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They ended up with seven studies—four on rodents (rats and mice), two on fruit flies and one on humans. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-review-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Review Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Several findings surfaced between these seven studies. Specifically, researchers found that subjects who had consumed kefir had: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;less beta-amyloid protein accumulation in the brain (four of the studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;higher antioxidant activity and reduced oxidative damage (five studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;reductions in neuro-inflammation (three studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;lower levels of brain cell death (three studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;enhanced insulin and glucose pathways in the brain (three studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;restoration of the intestinal lining (two studies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the human study specifically, kefir was associated with higher levels of antioxidant activity and better performance on several memory tests for people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Study Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This systematic review and meta-analysis included just one human study. Because non-human studies do not always translate to the same results in humans, we cannot say with a high degree of certainty that these results apply to humans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers note that because kefir can differ in composition, depending on how it’s made, it presents a significant limitation when comparing the results of different studies on kefir’s benefits. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers also note that larger, long-term human studies need to be performed to understand the safety and effectiveness of kefir as a complementary therapy alongside drugs taken for Alzheimer’s disease. This means that, based on current research, they cannot confidently say whether kefir is helpful or safe alongside other treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even if you aren’t concerned about your Alzheimer’s risk, kefir may still be a gut-healthy beverage &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-late-night-drink-for-weight-loss-11696463" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;worth adding to your routine&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir is a bit more sour-tasting than plain yogurt, but it’s a great addition to smoothies since it doubles as the liquid and is a probiotic. But that’s not all kefir contributes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to these researchers, kefir is also loaded with other healthy components, including protein, unsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates and a wealth of vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, D, E and K, B vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, potassium and zinc.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of the carbohydrates in kefir are complex carbohydrates, which feed the beneficial bacteria in the kefir and your gut, helping them to thrive and multiply. And if you’re lactose intolerant, there’s a chance your gut can tolerate kefir, since the process of making it reduces the amount of lactose to almost nothing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If plain kefir makes you pucker, you can find sweetened, flavored versions of kefir, usually in fruity flavors on the yogurt aisle. Just beware the sugar content, since many flavored varieties average around 8 grams of added sugar in an 8-ounce serving. With that said, if you don’t eat a lot of added sugar, this easily fits within the American Heart Association’s recommendation of limiting added sugar to no more than 25 grams a day for women and 36 grams a day for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kefir also comes in various levels of fat, depending on what type of milk was used to make it—from low-fat to whole-milk. And there are other varieties, including organic, grass-fed and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8032910/a2-milk/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;A2 kefir made from A2 milk&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t do dairy? There’s something for you, too, since kefir can also be made from non-dairy milks. You’re most likely to see non-dairy kefir made from coconut milk, but you may also find it made from soy and oat milks. There’s even &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265892/water-kefir/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;water kefir&lt;/a&gt; that you can make yourself by purchasing water kefir grains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Use kefir in any of your favorite smoothie recipes, including options like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/257793/berry-kefir-smoothie/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Berry-Kefir Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir can be used in place of buttermilk in your favorite baked goods, including pancakes, waffles and muffins. It can also be used as the buttermilk base of dressings, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8045018/homemade-ranch-dressing/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Ranch dressing&lt;/a&gt;. Or replace the milk in your mac and cheese recipe with plain kefir for an added probiotic boost. And of course, you can also sip it on its own. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating probiotic foods like kefir that enhance the gut microbiome is showing promise in playing a positive role in Alzheimer’s disease prevention. However, much more human research needs to be done. Until then, following an eating pattern like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-mind-diet-meal-plan-for-cognitive-health-11700108" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, which includes foods that have been shown to benefit brain health, is a good place to start. Besides fermented foods like kefir and yogurt, the MIND diet is also loaded with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds and healthy fats. It also includes lean proteins like chicken and seafood, and limits ultra-processed foods, red meat, sugar and salt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to food, other habits also play a role in brain health. If you smoke, get help to quit. Alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-drink-to-limit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-8743556" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;isn’t great for your brain health&lt;/a&gt;, so if you don’t drink, don’t start. If you do, limit your intake to no more than one or two drinks a day—though less is probably better. Loneliness is also a risk factor for dementia, so be sure you’re spending time with loved ones on a regular basis. Good sleep and regular exercise can help you out, too.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If that list seems overwhelming, take a deep breath and try improving just one thing at a time. Start with walking around the block a couple of days a week or limiting screen time before bed for better sleep. Small steps can lead to big changes when it comes to your health.

This was compared to those with levels above 3.4 mmol/L - the higher end of a healthy range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking statins saw those with LDL cholesterol levels below 1.8 mmol/L reduce their dementia risk by a further 13 per cent and 12 per cent for Alzheimer’s compared with people who do not take them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings emphasise the importance of targeted LDL- C management as part of dementia prevention strategies, with potential integration into clinical guidelines,” the authors wrote in the Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results support the use of statin therapy within specific LDL- C ranges for both cardiovascular and cognitive health benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deadly fungus is &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/28/health/dangerous-fungus-spreading-in-us-hospitals-has-rapidly-increased/"&gt;spreading like crazy&lt;/a&gt; across the United States, sickening and killing hospital patients — and the federal response has been ineffectual at best.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s been found in 29 states since 2016, including New York, and the increase in affected patients is soaring year by year, the American Journal of Infection Control has found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls the drug-resistant Candida auris fungus an  “urgent” threat, but talk is cheap. The agency is largely to blame for its rapid spread.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a textbook example of a federal agency crying out for the Trump administration’s reform. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A shockingly high number of those who contract this hospital-based germ — between 30% and 60% — die.  To put that in perspective, the case fatality rate of COVID-19 is 1.1%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the CDC reported 4,514 cases of C. auris infection in patients of all ages — nine times larger than that seen in the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/29/us-news/measles-outbreak-hits-483-cases-in-21-states-most-in-texas/"&gt;measles outbreak &lt;/a&gt;that has drawn significant public concern.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leftists are moaning that &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/01/us-news/hhs-starts-parting-with-10000-workers-as-rfk-jr-s-overhaul-plans-come-together/"&gt;HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Tuesday job cuts&lt;/a&gt;, which included 2,400 CDC staffers, will imperil our health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nonsense: The agency, more fittingly called the Centers for Disaster and Confusion, has fallen far short of its core mission of stopping the spread of contagious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But by fighting this dangerous new infection, Kennedy can get the agency back on track.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Here’s your to-do list, Mr. Secretary: Prioritize health over political correctness, opt for transparency over secrecy, and deploy new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, put a stop to woke distractions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2021, while C. auris cases soared by 500%, the CDC was busy scolding health-care workers about gender-specific terms like “mother” and “father” and stigmatizing words like “smoker” and “prisoner.”   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ridiculous. Cutting the CDC’s language police won’t harm our health a bit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, provide transparency. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not just price transparency, Republicans’ favorite cure-all, but &lt;em&gt;information &lt;/em&gt;transparency. “Bad care is a bad deal at any price,” says Leah Binder of patient-safety watchdog Leapfrog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once C. auris invades a hospital, it clings to furniture, ceiling tiles, curtains, mattresses and equipment like blood-pressure monitors and wheelchairs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When patients are exposed to the fungus it attaches to their skin — and it’s virtually impossible to get rid of it. A small number develop life-threatening infections, but many more become carriers indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If they’re later admitted to another hospital, they shed the fungus there, unknowingly spreading it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You don’t want to be treated in a hospital struggling with this contagion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the CDC hides which hospitals have it — protecting the hospital’s reputation, but not stopping the spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2022, when the fungus invaded a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/04/20/why-the-coverup-over-naming-hospitals-where-kids-are-dying-from-fungus/"&gt;Las Vegas hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit&lt;/a&gt; through contaminated echocardiogram equipment, a newborn died.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the CDC only revealed the details a year later — in a report that referred to the outbreak site as “Hospital A.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;If you’re about to give birth, you need to know whether the hospital you’re planning to use is battling C. auris.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That “Hospital A” jargon is no exception. The CDC &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; identifies hospitals or nursing facilities battling any type of infection. That’s unfair to the public.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the CDC must join us in the 21st century. The agency’s infection-control guidance for hospitals is straight out of the 1950s.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It recommends using “EPA-approved detergents” — known to be ineffective against C. auris — and discusses changing water in buckets and laundering mop heads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No mention of new technologies that can continuously and nontoxically decontaminate rooms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peer-reviewed medical journals, the gold standard, have demonstrated cutting-edge methods of ridding hospital rooms of C. auris. For example, dry hydrogen peroxide emitted through the HVAC system reduced fungal contamination in a Florida hospital’s burn unit by 93%&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Las Vegas hospital used the method to reduce C. auris contamination on surfaces from 70% to just 17%, reducing the risk that patients will pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Far-UV light can also destroy hospital infection germs without posing any risk to human skin and eyes, according to data published just last month&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the CDC is suspicious of solutions coming from the for-profit world, and the agency’s website and hospital guidelines reflect little awareness of what is technically possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No one has suffered more from the agency’s backward thinking than our schoolchildren.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;During the COVID pandemic, numerous technologies could have been employed to get schools up and running relatively virus-free.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, the CDC gave school administrators wacky, pointless advice to open the windows and keep desks six feet apart.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The public deserves a CDC that can provide up-to-date scientific guidance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr. Secretary, this is your roadmap. The CDC maintains hundreds of projects that have nothing to do with stopping infectious disease.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Slash them and fortify the CDC to battle deadly contagions. Our lives could depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On March 21,&lt;/strong&gt; a remarkable photograph of an orca named Quiver blew up on the Facebook page of Washington State’s Orca Network Community Group, a grass-roots organization that helps monitor Puget Sound’s orca population. The moment was captured by a Whidbey Island-based photographer named Cindi Rausch. Having some years ago moved to the island from Texas, Rausch, a retired high school literature teacher, had never seen a whale of any sort until one day in 2021, when heading back to her car after a morning beach walk, she passed a group of bystanders, all armed with binoculars and long-lensed cameras.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“Hey, where’ya going?” they inquired. “Whales are on the way!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Orcas, to be exact. But not just any old orcas, as Rausch would soon discover, when taking her place among the excited crowd, she immediately became captivated by the compelling story playing out in front of her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“I was told the orca family group approaching was designated T46,” Rausch recalls. “Which was primarily comprised of offspring of a very famous &lt;a href="https://www.theinertia.com/environment/kiler-whale-puget-sound-great-grand-calf-sea-world-orca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;female orca named ‘Wake.’&lt;/a&gt; In 1976, Wake and five other young orcas were captured and held in a netted pen in South Puget Sound for sale to various marine parks. This violent ‘orca roundup’ was witnessed by Washington governor’s aide &lt;a href="https://www.theinertia.com/environment/kiler-whale-puget-sound-great-grand-calf-sea-world-orca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ralph Munro&lt;/a&gt;, and the public outcry following his publicized first-hand account led not only to the release of Wake and the rest of the “Budd Inlet Six,” but a total ban on all orca capture in Washington state waters.”&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Quite understandably, Wake judiciously avoided all human contact until 13 years later, when she reemerged to public view accompanied by two daughters. Since that time, and until her death in 2023 at an estimated age of 57, Wake, as her family’s matriarch, is recognized by both researchers and orca-lovers alike as one of her species most prolific mothers. Having helped successfully rear a total of 27 offspring, she’s revered for the significant role she played in the current healthy state of today’s orca population.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;This was Wake’s extended family Rausch was introduced to that day, and from that day on, she became a dedicated orca-watcher, fired by a combination of intellectual curiosity and awe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;“These are apex predators, powerful, fierce creatures with teeth that tear prey apart,” says Rausch. “There’s nothing in the water they fear. Yet at the same time, they’re sleek, graceful, incredibly social animals, and intensely loyal to their families. It’s this dichotomy that really got me.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;That, and getting to know each member of this family individually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“After years of observation, you get to know every member of the T46 family by name,” Rausch explains. “Recognizing each not only by their distinctive dorsal fins and markings, but by their different personalities.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;On this particular afternoon, after receiving notification that the family group was sighted off Whidbey’s Keystone Inlet, Rausch, who out of sheer necessity had become an accomplished wildlife photographer, grabbed her big lens and rushed to the water’s edge. There she was just in time to document not only T46 members Thor, Loki, Strider, Quiver and Centeki successfully hunting down and killing an unlucky male Stellar sea lion, but the added presence of a lone outrigger canoe paddler (&lt;span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"&gt;which just happened to be me in my OC1&lt;/span&gt;), fortunate enough to find himself in the right place at the right time to witness the ensuing drama and its celebratory aftermath.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“This particular photo really resonates because of the perspective,” says Rausch. “We usually only see the whale’s dorsal fin and back. It’s rare to see the full body, the whole whale. But with the juxtaposing of the paddler in the frame, you’re struck by the whale’s enormity. And this is just Quiver, one of the family’s younger, smaller orcas. Yet what also makes the photo interesting is how the paddler is looking at Quiver in such a relaxed manner, and Quiver is obviously looking back.

These cells produce IGF-1, a protein critical for forming the myelin sheath that helps nerve signals travel efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both mice and preterm infants exposed to maternal inflammation, researchers found decreased levels of IGF-1 and delayed myelination on MRI scans. The findings suggest a potential therapeutic target to protect infant brain development and reduce the long-term effects of prenatal inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Cells Affected:&lt;/strong&gt; Maternal inflammation reduces CD11c-positive microglia during development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myelination Delays:&lt;/strong&gt; Lower IGF-1 levels linked to disrupted myelin formation in infants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting microglia may prevent long-term neurodevelopmental delays.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Nagoya University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A research group led by Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine in Japan has uncovered a potential mechanism linking maternal inflammation to delayed neurodevelopment in infants. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research suggests the role of CD11c-positive microglia—immune cells in the brain crucial for myelination—during infant brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108344"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a baby's face and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When they performed MRI of the infants, the scans confirmed that they had a higher incidence of delayed myelination.   Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, published in &lt;em&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt;, suggest new strategies to mitigate the long-term neurodevelopmental effects of maternal inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation during pregnancy occurs when the mother’s immune system becomes activated during pregnancy, typically due to an infection, autoimmune response, or environmental factors. It can have negative outcomes for the baby, potentially causing long-term cognitive and behavioral challenges.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a research team led by Kazuya Fuma and Tomomi Kotani has discovered the role of CD11c-positive microglia in this process. Microglia, the brain’s immune cells, play a key role in myelination, the process where nerve fibers are coated with myelin. Myelin is essential for making the nerve cells able to transmit electrical signals efficiently.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the researchers tested mice that were exposed to maternal inflammation. They found that the proliferation of these cells was reduced. Then, to determine if these findings were relevant to humans, the researchers analyzed cord blood from preterm infants exposed to chorioamnionitis, a condition that causes inflammation during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found lower levels of IGF-1, a protein linked to CD11c-positive microglia, in their samples. When they performed MRI of the infants, the scans confirmed that they had a higher incidence of delayed myelination.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inflammation during pregnancy suppressed the increase in CD11c microglia that we usually see during typical infant development,” Fuma said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CD11c microglia have been reported to be involved in myelination by being a major source of IGF-1. In the present study, both were decreased in inflammation during pregnancy, suggesting that this pathway is impaired in children with delayed neurodevelopment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study sheds light on the complex relationship between maternal inflammation and neurodevelopment. The researchers hope that understanding the role of CD11c-positive microglia in neurodevelopment will lead to new therapeutic strategies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If future studies confirm a decrease in these microglia in preterm infants exposed to inflammatory conditions, such as chorioamnionitis, early interventions could be developed to prevent or reduce the neurodevelopmental impact of maternal inflammation,” Fuma said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By targeting CD11c-positive microglia, it may be possible to protect infants from the long-term consequences of impaired myelination and improve their chances for healthy cognitive development.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this maternal inflammation and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#eb8288848686b4998e988e8a998883ab9fc5868a8287c5858a8c84928ac69ec58a88c5819b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matthew Coslett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nagoya-u.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nagoya University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Matthew Coslett – Nagoya University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-07511-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prenatal Inflammation Impairs Early CD11c-Positive Microglia Induction and Delays Myelination in Neurodevelopmental Disorders&lt;/a&gt;” by Kazuya Fuma et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prenatal Inflammation Impairs Early CD11c-Positive Microglia Induction and Delays Myelination in Neurodevelopmental Disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Histological chorioamnionitis (HCA) is a form of maternal immune activation (MIA) linked to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our previous study identified neurodevelopmental impairments in an MIA mouse model mimicking HCA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, this study investigated the role of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia, key contributors to myelination through IGF-1 production, in this pathology. In the mouse model, the CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglial population was significantly lower in the MIA group than in the control group on postnatal day 3 (PN3d).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, myelination-related protein levels significantly decreased in the MIA group at PN8d. In humans, preterm infants with HCA exhibited higher IL-6 and IL-17A cord-serum levels and lower IGF-1 levels than those without HCA, followed by a higher incidence of delayed myelination on magnetic resonance imaging at the term-equivalent age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In silico analysis revealed that the transient induction of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia during early development occurred similarly in mice and humans. Notably, a lack of high CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglial population has been observed in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study reports impaired induction of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia during postnatal development in a mouse model of MIA associated with delayed myelination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings may inform strategies for improving outcomes in infants with HCA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 21:58:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPM1ZGYWJtM205ZjhGQVJCSTI2alpSbW9lSWVNbl9icGkxS2ZfUy1jajF2WjhQQ0dBQlU0a0RkX3cxNzNUVmJsbXpwVi0yclk4R2lDcU41czlEZHVoeWdlYjl1M0tCQnRGT2tyd095VmZyNVFCR3BvNXhrNUlDMlVCc1hvRHVobnRJ</guid></item><item><title>Dozens of free measles vaccine clinics close in Texas as federal funding is cut - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQZ3ZLNFcxdkExVDRBa25VaWhVUWNWand5dXkzTjhXY2FyeVdEMkpnTFBubzgyX1NfQWdxRWpsSHJCOUx4WThHTDMwQ3ZtT3dMTFM3QlhOS0VRalhnc0FETVlTbWJYY2lkeDE0SkFFd0FqNkZCT3diSHRNam9DazdwUEJMemVyOEY5RGEzVHp3Z0Vyb0M0RFdyb3RHQTZFSXB6R0k0dllZNGVPbUdLZlHSAVZBVV95cUxOVmVVZTE1R1pJeUE3Q2dScjRJZkplN0xCQWl3aU9iNHlDaUc2SUkyaVUtdlYzWHNxYWp2d3I4U3RsT0NyMzVhRmtEei0xSDFsb0kwZ2ltdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" target="_blank"&gt;Steep federal funding cuts &lt;/a&gt;have forced public health officials in one of Texas’ most populous counties — Dallas — to cancel dozens of vaccination clinics and lay off 21 workers on the front lines of combatting the state’s growing measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I just had to tell our commissioners this morning that we’ve had to cancel over 50 different clinics in our community,” said Dr. Philip Huang, director and health authority for the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. Many of the clinics had been planned for schools in areas with low vaccination rates, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The vaccines, which included measles, mumps and rubella shots, were meant to be given free to families. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The money being cut — $11.4 billion nationwide — was originally allocated to aid community health departments during the pandemic. Local public health officials have more recently been using the Covid funds for other public health initiatives, such as measles prevention, surveillance and testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Last week however, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it would “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" target="_blank"&gt;no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars&lt;/a&gt; responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s very short-sighted and not understanding of the way public health works,” Huang said. “Being prepared for Covid helps build our capacity to be able to respond to other issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Huang said his team was still assessing the exact amount of money slashed in his budget, but estimated it to be in the millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As of Tuesday, 422 measles had been reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;.

MDGA2 typically keeps BDNF/TrkB signaling in check, but when MDGA2 levels drop, heightened neuronal activity and social impairments occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice with reduced MDGA2 showed behaviors resembling autism, including repetitive grooming and social withdrawal. Treatment with a peptide that mimics MDGA2 restored balance and eased symptoms, suggesting a potential pathway for future autism therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein Imbalance:&lt;/strong&gt; Low MDGA2 disrupts BDNF/TrkB signaling, triggering ASD-like symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; Affected mice showed repetitive behaviors and social deficits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Mimicking MDGA2 reduced symptoms, pointing to new treatment avenues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In mice, autism symptoms arise when a certain pair of competing nerve proteins falls out of equilibrium, according to a study published April 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; by Dongdong Zhao of Wenzhou Medical University, China, Yun-wu Zhang of Xiamen University, China, and colleagues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 1% of the world population is considered to have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), exhibiting a series of social and cognitive symptoms.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, Zhao, Zhang and colleagues used mice to examine the activity of two neuronal proteins suspected to be linked to ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MDGA2 is a protein involved in the transmission of nerve signals, and certain mutations in the &lt;em&gt;MDGA2&lt;/em&gt; gene have been identified in ASD patients. Experimental trials revealed that mice with reduced levels of MDGA2 exhibited ASD-like symptoms, including repetitive grooming and altered social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mice also exhibited increased activity in certain nerve synapses and increased levels of BDNF, another neuronal protein that has been linked to ASD and functions through binding and activating the TrkB protein. When these mice were treated with an artificial peptide that mimicked MDGA2 and inhibited BDNF/TrkB activity, the symptoms lessened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these results combined with previous research, the authors suggest that MDGA2 and BDNF maintain a natural balance by competing with each other for TrkB protein binding sites, and disruption to this system can lead to regulatory changes in neuron activity related to ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This protein system might be a promising target for future therapeutic treatments, but further investigation will be required into the exact functions of this system and its relationship to ASD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yun-wu Zhang adds, “Mutations in the &lt;em&gt;MDGA2 &lt;/em&gt;gene causes autism spectrum disorders (ASD) but the underlying mechanism is elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study reveals a novel role of MDGA2 in keeping the BDNF/TrkB signaling at bay for normal excitatory neuronal activity, and demonstrates that MDGA2 deficiency results in aberrant BDNF/TrkB activation and elevated excitatory neuronal activity, leading to ASD-like phenotypes in mice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82001442 to D.Z., and 82130039 and U21A20361 to Y.-w.Z.), and Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (2020M671948 to D.Z., and 2022M722651 to Y.H.).

Both loss of MDGA2 and the ASD-associated MDGA2 V930I mutation promote the BDNF/TrkB signaling activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, we demonstrate that inhibiting the BDNF/TrkB signaling by both small molecular compound and MDGA2-derived peptide can attenuate the increase of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic activity and social deficits in MDGA2-deficient mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results highlight a novel MDGA2-BDNF/TrkB-dependent mechanism underlying the synaptic function regulation, which may become a therapeutic target for ASD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 21:24:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9oaUEtQkFoSTlaUEIyT1dLZUdtV2doYlFkSkFHdkZYYjRZN1paVGpSZDBEMFQtMFoySjdkS1BNT0xpdzAtYzY4NG50YlFEZ1VKRWFfVzdBMVh2QXN2S0RzeWNsanlKV2s</guid></item><item><title>Hidden Heart Risks: Antidepressants Linked to Sudden Cardiac Death - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPVGJiYWJjZGFFOFNVcEdSZGxEa0dGV1J1dkVoanhUWjh2WGtjel9Ea2RCVGJ0TFo0V1FQMHBUanBNTmU3Qk9fT2o3Yl9tOXJHb2c5YzlUaTRqN2dZbnZRN0RxU0ZVSTZMVnFOOVcya01sSFJEN0pSM2Y5VHU1S18za2hrb3BCOVhSQndkV3pNa1BNVUU4T3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 21:11:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPVGJiYWJjZGFFOFNVcEdSZGxEa0dGV1J1dkVoanhUWjh2WGtjel9Ea2RCVGJ0TFo0V1FQMHBUanBNTmU3Qk9fT2o3Yl9tOXJHb2c5YzlUaTRqN2dZbnZRN0RxU0ZVSTZMVnFOOVcya01sSFJEN0pSM2Y5VHU1S18za2hrb3BCOVhSQndkV3pNa1BNVUU4T3c</guid></item><item><title>New study says Lexington has among the highest STI rates in the country - WKYT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQOHZ5c1V6Yi1rLUdYZFI0dkg1dU5UaGprTzAtSTVIdi1VeHd3cWNOQU8zTEtCRUxEcG5PNnBIc1VEVVZJeG9SQlhPTGlHd2tuRUlrVlRXZFB5RndKOEh6S2gzaWtQekZvaEtJMnpDS2VqNU1iQ19FeElQMTh6aE9ncXBzMnVxSkQtVXdCUmNjbjNLS1BBVGRHcw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;LEXINGTON, Ky.

This division helped develop guidance around drugs called pre-exposure prophylaxis — or PrEP — which are 99% effective at preventing HIV when taken by people who are HIV negative and at risk of infection. This branch studies where in the U.S. PrEP is needed and how access can be improved. It also develops new, accurate and accessible tests for HIV (like self-tests) and administers the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://takemehome.org/" target="_self"&gt;Take Me Home&lt;/a&gt; test-by-mail program.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quantitative Sciences: &lt;/b&gt;Makes models to see how different prevention activities are working and at what cost to taxpayers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-component  b-margin-bottom-d40-m20  image-portrait" data-index="18"&gt;&lt;div class="image-component-image inline "&gt;&lt;div class="enlargeImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: AJC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="[object%20Object]" class="image-expand" alt="icon to expand image"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: AJC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="MP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="RP09 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="21"&gt;In addition to the staff cuts, Brooks said the Public Health Associate Program was also closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="22"&gt;If that fellowship program is, in fact, cut, Georgia would lose critical HIV prevention workers. The Georgia Department of Public Health has one CDC–Public Health Associate Program staff member who works to reduce new HIV infections in Georgia, the department has previously said. Cobb, Gwinnett, Macon and DeKalb have Public Health Associate Program staff as well who work on prevention and surveillance activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="23"&gt;The Department of Public Health did not immediately respond to a request for comment and has previously directed comment to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="24"&gt;Zeigler, the public health consultant, says cuts to the CDC’s prevention budget will be felt in Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="25"&gt;“In northwest Georgia, we have high rates of opioid drug use,” she said. “It’s easier to transmit HIV in these settings. If people are pregnant, they can give birth to children who have HIV. That’s one of the many reasons why we need prevention efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="PX01 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="27"&gt;HIV prevention drugs cost $30 a month without insurance or are free with insurance.
