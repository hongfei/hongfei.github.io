&lt;p&gt;It’s been five years since the start of a zoonotic COVID-19 pandemic that &lt;a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;killed millions of people&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the United Nations is urging member governments to take coordinated action to address &lt;a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the “unprecedented” spread of highly pathogenic bird flu&lt;/a&gt; — a threat to health, food security, biodiversity and more. The world has reached an inflection point, another chance to do what is needed to prevent a health crisis.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will either be remembered as the moment we failed to save lives or the moment we finally reckoned with the dangers of factory farming and our mass exploitation of animals. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The warning from the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization came on March 17, the same day the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-reported-first-outbreak-h7n9-bird-flu-farm-since-2017-woah-says-2025-03-17/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a new U.S. outbreak of dangerous H7N9 bird flu&lt;/a&gt; was reported. Since it first emerged in 2013, the strain has a nearly 40 percent mortality rate in humans, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/westernpacific/wpro-emergencies/surveillance/avian-influenza"&gt;translating to 616 human deaths&lt;/a&gt; in China. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite troubling signs that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/severe-bird-flu-cases-virus-can-mutate-lingers-body-rcna186009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the virus is mutating and could become more transmissible&lt;/a&gt;, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s $1 billion strategy to fight bird flu is &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trumps-plan-combat-bird-flu-will-ensure-more-bird-flu-opinion-2042335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;likely to create more danger,&lt;/a&gt; as the federal agency funnels $400 million into factory farms as reimbursements for chickens lost. In so doing, it is propping up the very industry fueling the spread of zoonotic disease.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since early 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nearly 170 million farmed birds have died or been killed&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. due to bird flu outbreaks, equivalent to roughly half the country’s human population. Just since last year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;70 human cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported, the majority of which resulted from direct exposure to livestock. Three came from unknown sources. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We already know that &lt;a href="https://www.emro.who.int/fr/about-who/rc61/zoonotic-diseases.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;75 percent of emerging human pathogens are zoonotic&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, by farming animals in the billions, we are playing with fire. Factory farms confine thousands of animals into unsanitary facilities, where workers are &lt;a href="https://investigatemidwest.org/2024/12/04/bird-flu-ppe-access-in-dairy-producing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;often left unprotected&lt;/a&gt; from disease.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While some have blamed wild birds for the presence of bird flu on large-scale farms, it is more likely that &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/can-wild-birds-spread-avian-influenza-domestic-poultry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;failures to prevent diseases from spreading on farms are the real culprits&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, research has shown that &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250224/Study-finds-strong-evidence-that-bird-flu-spreads-through-the-air-between-farms.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ventilation systems on factory farms may be fueling airborne transmission&lt;/a&gt; of bird flu; &lt;a href="https://time.com/7212477/wastewater-testing-farms-bird-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scientists are currently tracking&lt;/a&gt; wastewater from these intensive operations as a potential avenue for the virus’s spread. The hazards of factory farms themselves are compounded by the clearing of forests for animal agriculture, which diminishes planetary resilience and pushes humans and wildlife into &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/analysis-how-deforestation-helps-deadly-viruses-jump-from-animals-to-humans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ever closer contact and toward a higher risk of disease transmission&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than protecting the public, the U.S. government remains focused on bolstering corporations and lowering egg prices, which, according to a recent report, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/04/egg-prices-bird-flu-corporate-profits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;have likely been artificially inflated&lt;/a&gt; by agribusiness titans taking advantage of consumers. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;As the USDA bails out animal agriculture and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggests that the nation &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;allow bird flu to spread through its poultry industry&lt;/a&gt;, it is critical that a country in which &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;99 percent of all farmed animals are kept on factory farms&lt;/a&gt; begin taking this escalating threat seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600" alt="" class="wp-image-4329764" srcset="https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w" sizes="(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To protect the health of animals and humans, the Trump administration should quickly shift support away from factory farming in favor of a safer and more sustainable plant-based food system. Otherwise, we could be reflecting on an even deadlier pandemic five years from now.  &lt;/p&gt;

            A growing body of evidence has increasingly linked diet sodas and other no- or low-calorie foods with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/health/video/zero-calorie-sweetener-weight-gain-sanjay-gupta-digvid"&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt; — so much so that the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/15/health/who-sweeteners-weigh-loss-guideline-wellness/index.html"&gt;issued an advisory&lt;/a&gt; in May 2023 saying not to use sugar substitutes for weight loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000d3b6m7q0gyjt9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Replacing free sugars with non-sugar sweeteners does not help people control their weight long-term,” Dr. Francesco Branca, director of WHO’s department of nutrition and food safety, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/23/health/artificial-sweetener-reduction-wellness"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000f3b6md97rbbyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, a new study may shed light on why consuming too much of the artificial sweetener sucralose could be counterproductive. Instead of the brain sending a signal to eat less, sucralose triggers an increase in appetite when consumed in a drink.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000g3b6mpjv9j5k5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sucralose activates the area in the brain that regulates hunger, and that activation, in turn, is linked to greater ratings of hunger,” said lead study author Dr. Katie Page, an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics and director of the Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000h3b6mzk2mdcbj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In fact, people who drank water with sucralose said their appetite increased by nearly 20% compared with drinking water with table sugar, Page said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000i3b6mv5lex0th@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, sucralose is a key ingredient in some Splenda sugar substitutes.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In Europe, &lt;a href="https://www.kraftchemical.com/product/sucralose/" target="_blank"&gt;sucralose is known as E955&lt;/a&gt; and is found in sugar substitutes sold under the brand names Candys, Canderel Yellow, Cukren, Nevella, Splenda, SucraPlus, Sukrana and Zerocal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000j3b6m7xd0tliz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study only investigated the impact of sucralose and did not research other popular artificials sweeteners such as &lt;a href="https://www.kraftchemical.com/product/aspartame/" target="_blank"&gt;aspartame&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.kraftchemical.com/product/acesulfame-k/" target="_blank"&gt;acesulfame-K&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.kraftchemical.com/product/sodium-saccharin/" target="_blank"&gt;sodium saccharin&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000k3b6mx34q7qjb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is a very high quality study, using state of the art methods and careful analysis,” said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine, via email. Katz, founder of the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://www.truehealthinitiative.org/" target="_blank"&gt;True Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine, was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000l3b6msgx0rmv5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors interpreted their results carefully yet make a strong case that “non-caloric sweeteners, and sucralose specifically, interfere with normal appetite regulation in ways that could have adverse effects on weight control and health,” Katz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000m3b6mnamo4nj6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson for Heartland Food Products Group, which manufactures Splenda, said that low-calorie and zero-calorie sweeteners are backed by research and expert recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8taooq900043b6m6173swe4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Low- or zero-calorie sweeteners like sucralose are recommended by healthcare professionals, food safety experts and credible health organizations for diabetes and weight management based on trusted scientific research showing that the impact of low- or zero-calorie sweeteners on body weight is similar to that of water, and that sweet-tasting products have decreased the want for additional sweets while also helping people manage weight, reduce intake of calories from added sugars, and manage blood sugar levels,” the spokesperson wrote via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000o3b6mt2yjecmu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The idea that artificial sweeteners may be increasing hunger signals from the mammalian brain isn’t new — a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784545?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=092821" target="_blank"&gt;prior study&lt;/a&gt; coauthored by Page  found women and people with obesity were especially sensitive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000p3b6mw322oruy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Animal studies have hinted at some of these effects,” Katz said. However, “this is, to my knowledge, the most decisive study to date in humans of direct effects on the appetite center.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000q3b6mvo3wc56e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All cells in the body require glucose for energy. The brain is the biggest user, gobbling up to &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news-events/publications-archive/brain/sugar-brain" target="_blank"&gt;half of all sugars&lt;/a&gt; circulating in the blood. Nature, however,  designed the brain to respond to natural sugars such as glucose found in whole fruits and some vegetables.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000r3b6mwpjda4uj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Artificial sweeteners, therefore, appear to confuse the brain, Page said, by sending signals of sweetness without delivering the needed calories the brain requires. Scientists have hypothesized that when those promised calories don’t arrive, the brain may send out a signal to eat more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000s3b6mnad22171@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01227-8" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature Metabolism, asked 75 people to consume one of three drinks on three separate occasions: plain water, water sweetened with table sugar (sucrose), and water sweetened with sucralose.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000t3b6m1yl5quh2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During each visit, the research team tested participants’ fasting blood sugar levels, followed by a brain scan called Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or fMRI, which tracks blood flow to capture activity in different regions of the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000u3b6mg7bi0qx1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They came out of the scanner and consumed one of the three drinks, and went back into the scanner,” Page said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000v3b6mh1tlp2ke@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One glass contained 300 milliliters of water and 75 grams (about 2.5 ounces) of sugar (sucrose), which is the equivalent of a 16-ounce can of sugary soda, Page said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000w3b6mndvnxqp2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another drink contained enough sucralose to match that sweetness. Sucralose is about &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/aspartame-and-other-sweeteners-food#:~:text=Sucralose%20is%20sold%20under%20the,under%20certain%20conditions%20of%20use." target="_blank"&gt;600 times sweeter than sugar&lt;/a&gt;, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. The third drink was plain water, which served as a control.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000x3b6m3h8dwyes@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the brain scanning, Page and her team did another round of blood sampling at 10 minutes, 35 minutes and 120 minutes after consuming the drink and asked participants to rate their hunger level.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000y3b6m3stwgnre@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “(The study) is particularly strong because it used repeated measures within the same participants and included different methods such as brain imaging, blood draws, and subjective ratings to test their hypothesis,” said Kyle Burger, a scientist at the nonprofit Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, which investigates human senses of taste and smell. Burger was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000z3b6muet2vijq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to finding that drinks with sucralose increased the sensation of hunger by about 17%, Page and her team found increased connections to other parts of the brain responsible for controlling motivation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00103b6m6own09nl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sucralose appears to affect your decision-making skills,” Page said. “For example, we found increased brain connectivity between the hypothalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex, which controls the risks and rewards of a decision.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00113b6mvhtamvd9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, blood tests showed sucralose had no effect on hormones the brain uses to tell when we are satisfied and no longer hungry, Page said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00123b6m293hhjj6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s no signal, no signal at all,” she said. “There’s a sweetness signal, but there’s no hormone signal telling you you’re full. Sucralose doesn’t have an effect on those hormones.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00133b6moqaw01g5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not everyone, however, may feel the combined effects of sucralose in the same way, Katz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00143b6meg4td4fb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those with insulin resistance, for instance, may be especially prone to disruption of normal appetite control with sucralose,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00153b6m3g8hwie2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recommendations on how to manage the body’s reactions to artificial sweeteners are currently complex, Page said. For example, the American Diabetes Association tells people with insulin resistance and diabetes to &lt;a href="https://professional.diabetes.org/sites/dpro/files/2023-12/sugar_substitutes.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;use no-calorie drinks and foods&lt;/a&gt;, but sparingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00163b6mbkjgorub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m an endocrinologist so I see patients for diabetes and obesity,” Page said. “I would never say drink or eat more sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00173b6m0u3z10bh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Instead, I tell my patients to not rely on non-caloric sweeteners as a substitute for sugar and try to reduce the overall intake of dietary sweeteners in general,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00183b6mmh4l1kbv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Katz agreed, preferring to suggest a form of &lt;a href="https://hartfordhealthcare.org/file%20library/services/pdfs/hvi-lifestyle-taste-bud-rehab-3-pager-hartford-healthcare.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;taste bud “rehab&lt;/a&gt;” that can reduce overall use of sugars, no matter what their form.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00193b6m4lorqw8t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A truly wholesome diet has little added sugar in the first place, and thus no sugar to ‘replace’ with sucralose and related compounds,” Katz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir001a3b6msfhv72ya@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Just as many people have cut their use of salt, it’s possible to cut your use of sweeteners by teaching taste buds to desire fewer sweets, he said. Taste buds will respond by finding sugary foods that used to be delicious now cloyingly sweet, or in the case of sodium, much too salty, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4500487/#:~:text=In%20summer%202014%2C%2020%20people,use%20less%20or%20even%20no" target="_blank"&gt;research has shown&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir001b3b6mjmytvsiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Start out by finding hidden sources of sugar in foods you may not realize are sweetened, Katz told CNN in a prior interview.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir001c3b6m9bqu0w9m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I asked you to boycott all the desserts in your life, you would probably rebel or fail,” Katz said. “But there is a massive amount of added sugar and sweeteners hiding in foods that are not sweet — in salad dressing, pasta sauce, bread, crackers, even salty chips.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir001d3b6mi2hdkx8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By choosing products without sweeteners, he said, it’s possible to reduce a person’s daily intake of sugar or sweeteners “by a third, maybe even a half as many grams a day before we even lay a hand on anything that you actually expect to be sweet.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Would you add a few more vegetables and whole grains to your diet in return &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/protecting-your-muscle-mass-is-vital-for-healthy-aging-heres-why"&gt;for a healthy old age&lt;/a&gt;? A new study has broken down in detail the food groups that increase the likelihood of healthy aging – and identified the best diet overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of the study, researchers led by a team from Harvard University defined healthy aging as reaching 70 without any chronic diseases – and still being &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-sign-of-dementia-risk-may-be-keeping-you-up-at-night"&gt;in good shape mentally&lt;/a&gt; and physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) came top of eight &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-should-eat-more-of-these-8-healthy-foods-and-heres-why"&gt;healthy dietary patterns&lt;/a&gt; studied: &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/scoring-highly-on-alternative-healthy-eating-index-lowers-risk-for-many-illnesses-202202082681"&gt;developed by Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, the AHEI prioritizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diet also keeps red and processed meats, sugary drinks, and salt down to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156605" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156605" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DietChart.jpg" alt="Diet chart" class="wp-image-156605 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DietChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DietChart-509x415.jpg 509w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DietChart-600x489.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156605" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;All the dietary guidelines studied improved the likelihood of healthy aging. (Tessier et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings also show that there is no one-size-fits-all diet," &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Anne-Julie Tessier, a professor of nutrition from the University of Montreal in Canada. "Healthy diets can be adapted to fit individual needs and preferences."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers tracked the eating habits of 105,015 people across the course of 30 years, cross-referencing how their diets matched up with the eight sets of healthy eating guidelines – and then checking health at 70 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, sticking closely to any of the diet plans improved the chances of aging healthily, and there was a lot of crossover in terms of the healthy eating recommendations: fruits, vegetables, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_grain"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt;, and unsaturated fats were frequently mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 9,771 people met the health criteria at 70, with the AHEI showing the most benefits. The participants who ranked in the top fifth in terms of AHEI adherence were 86 percent more likely to be healthy at 70 than those in the lowest fifth. It seems &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-mediterranean-lifestyle-really-can-help-you-live-longer-study-shows"&gt;the widely praised Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; may have some competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Studies have previously investigated dietary patterns in the context of specific diseases or how long people live," &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology from Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ours takes a multifaceted view, asking, how does diet impact people's ability to live independently and enjoy a good quality of life as they age?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associations between diet and good health have been demonstrated in countless studies – whether you want to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-can-add-10-years-to-your-life-simply-by-changing-your-diet-massive-study-finds"&gt;add years to your life&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-japanese-diet-is-linked-to-less-brain-shinkage-in-women-experts-say"&gt;keep your brain ticking over&lt;/a&gt; – and while this new research doesn't show direct cause and effect, the link is strong enough to give us useful extra evidence for the benefits of eating well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since staying active and independent is a priority for both individuals and public health, research on healthy aging is essential," &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Marta Guasch-Ferré, a professor of epidemiology from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that dietary patterns rich in plant-based foods, with moderate inclusion of healthy animal-based foods, may promote overall healthy aging and help shape future dietary guidelines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03570-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Yvonne Vávra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayor of New York City refuses to walk in a straight line, loves hanging out in front of Zabar’s hoping to snag a bagel, and enjoys bossing around dogs — but only the large white ones, because he thinks they’re sheep. There. The truth is out. He also loves jumping into freshly made beds and messing them up. But that’s all just because he’s a dog. Simon of Riverside Drive is the official Dog Mayor of New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Simon this week and was shocked to learn not only that we had a Dog Mayor, but that he’s a fellow Upper West Sider! The seven-year-old basset hound-cattle dog mix was sworn in just two months ago on the steps of City Hall, becoming only the second Dog Mayor in the city’s history. He succeeded basset hound Sally Long Dog of the East Village, who had served for two years. In front of some of the city’s most prominent human elected officials, Simon pledged to “uphold the office of New York City Dog Mayor with liberty — and yes, dognity — for all,” before shaking paws with Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who administered the Oaf of Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_92536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-92536" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-92536 size-full" src="https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/79DE0DEF-E6A3-4545-99CF-ECEDA67E5F14-e1743105642230.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/79DE0DEF-E6A3-4545-99CF-ECEDA67E5F14-e1743105642230.jpeg 640w, https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/79DE0DEF-E6A3-4545-99CF-ECEDA67E5F14-e1743105642230-300x149.jpeg 300w, https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/79DE0DEF-E6A3-4545-99CF-ECEDA67E5F14-e1743105642230-360x180.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-92536" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Photograph courtesy of Sophie.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Honorary New York City Dog Mayor Election was founded by media producer and dog lover Stephen Calabria as a way to bring joy and foster community during challenging times. With many people feeling overwhelmed, disillusioned, and tangled in the chaos of national politics, electing a Dog Mayor seems like an initiative pawsitively everyone can get behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s much more than a happy escape. A Dog Mayor may not know how to come up with plans or proposals to serve the greater good, nor how to mobilize people to step up. Not that many human politicians know, either. But dogs do, in fact, have qualities every good leader needs: They have the power to bring people together and foster a sense of belonging, which many of us crave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking the streets these days, I sometimes feel panic rising because everything seems so normal. People go about their business, sitting on benches, laughing, and eating ice cream. “We have no time for ice cream!” my brain screams. Please excuse it; it’s been screaming a lot, and it’s my fault. I’ve exposed it to too much news. Now it’s running wild, eyes wide and flailing: “The nerve of people to sit on benches in these times!” We should rather … uh … do something. But what? I don’t know. Anyone? The way I experience things is exactly what bad times need to stay bad: people feeling disconnected, scared, hopeless, and jaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, it’s absolutely crucial to eat ice cream. We need to enjoy life and each other’s company, gather, and find out if the people sitting on benches feel the same way. That’s how we gain the strength to create positive change. The power of connection can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And who can teach us how to foster these connections? Mayor Simon — representing all the canines of Gotham. Dogs show us that community-building doesn’t have to be complicated: Wag your way into shared moments of joy, be present, loyal, supportive, and always ready to lend a paw to anyone in need. Woof to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_92537" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-92537" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-92537 size-full" src="https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_4590-scaled.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_4590-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_4590-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_4590-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_4590-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_4590-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_4590-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w, https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_4590-750x563.jpeg 750w, https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_4590-1140x855.jpeg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-92537" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sophie and Simon.

&lt;p&gt;Dogs don’t even need to do anything — their presence alone makes us stronger. There’s plenty of scientific evidence showing that dogs not only promote positive interactions between people, but also strengthen social trust and encourage helping behavior within communities. And, of course, they’re natural icebreakers. If you’ve ever walked with a dog, you know how many smiles and conversations come your way. Those small moments that acknowledge your presence instantly make you feel like you belong. You’re not just a passerby; you’re one of the crowd, part of the pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never met more people than I have since adopting Simon,” says Sophie, the Mayor’s mom. “We get stopped all the time, and I actually have close friends who I met because of Simon. I have so many interactions in a day — that’s my favorite part about the Upper West Side. We love it here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon may never pass a law or make a speech. But we should follow his lead. He ran on the slogan “Adopt a Brighter Future” and plans to use his term to champion animal rescue and adoption. Let’s adopt that mindset and rescue one another from facing these chaotic times alone. Short-legged Simon running the highest pawffice in the city reminds us that making a difference doesn’t always require big, bold steps. Sometimes, it’s simply about showing up with an open, loyal heart. The strength of our community lies not in how much we do, but how well we do it together — never forgetting to refuel along the way. Ice cream for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

A moment in a crib, or the taste of a first birthday cake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="300" data-end="534"&gt;Chances are, those memories aren’t real. Decades of research suggest that most people cannot recall personal experiences from the first few years of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 3 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 1 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 2 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 3 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-start="536" data-end="789"&gt;However, even though we can’t remember being a baby, a new study has found new evidence that babies do take in the world around them and may also begin forming memories far earlier than once thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-did-the-study-work-and-what-did-it-find"&gt;How did the study work and what did it find?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study published this month in Science by researchers at Yale and Columbia universities has revealed that babies as young as 12 months old can form memories via the hippocampus – a part of the brain that stores memories in adults, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To observe this, the researchers used a specially adapted brain scan for infants during a single session. It allowed them to watch how babies’ brains responded while they were awake and looking at images of faces and objects. Parents remained close to their babies, which helped keep them calm and alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, 26 infants aged four to 25 months were shown a series of images. It was found that if a baby’s hippocampus was more active the first time they saw a particular image, they would look at the same image for longer when it reappeared a short time later, next to a new one – suggesting they recognised it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that babies’ brains have the capacity for forming memories – but how long-lasting these memories are is still an open question,” said Tristan Yates, a postdoctoral research scientist in the department of psychology at Columbia University and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time scientists have directly observed how a memory begins to take shape in an awake baby’s brain. Previous &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34022155/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; relied on indirect observations, such as watching whether babies reacted to something familiar. This time, however, researchers observed brain activity linked to specific memories as they form in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most past brain activity studies have been done while babies were asleep, which limited what researchers could learn about conscious memory-building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-does-this-tell-us-about-early-life-memories"&gt;What does this tell us about early life memories?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that episodic memory – the kind of memory that helps us remember specific events and the context in which they took place – begins to develop earlier than scientists previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, it was widely believed that this type of memory didn’t begin to form until well after a baby’s first birthday, typically around 18 to 24 months. Although the findings from the Science study were strongest in infants older than 12 months, the results were observed in much younger babies as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="so-at-what-age-do-we-start-making-memories"&gt;So, at what age do we start making memories?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now understood that babies begin forming limited types of memory when they are as young as two or three months. These include implicit memories (such as motor skills) and statistical learning, which helps infants detect patterns in language, faces and routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, episodic memory, which allows us to recall specific events as well as where and when they occurred, takes longer to develop and requires the maturation of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Cristina Maria Alberini, professor of neural science at New York University, the period in infancy when the hippocampus is developing its ability to form and store memories may be “critical”. This window could be important not only for memory but also has “great implications for mental health and memory or cognitive disorders”, she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memories formed in early childhood do not typically last very long, it is believed, which might explain why we can’t remember them later in life. In an ongoing study at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Germany, 20-month-old toddlers &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/are-your-earliest-childhood-memories-still-lurking-your-mind-or-gone-forever"&gt;were able to remember&lt;/a&gt; which toy was in which room for up to six months, while younger children retained the memory for only about one month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-can-t-we-remember-anything-from-infancy"&gt;Why can’t we remember anything from infancy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="465"&gt;Humans’ near-universal inability to recall personal experiences from before the age of about three is a phenomenon known as “infantile amnesia”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="465"&gt;For decades, scientists believed this happens simply because babies’ brains were too immature to store episodic memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="465"&gt;But the Science study has shown that babies do indeed form memories. The mystery is &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; those memories become inaccessible as we grow older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="467" data-end="780"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adw1923"&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt;, scientists say, is that babies’ brains undergo rapid neurogenesis – the fast-paced creation of new neurons in the brain. This rapid growth might disrupt or “write over” existing memories. In animal studies, when scientists slowed this process in baby mice, the mice were able to retain memories much longer – similar to adult mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1066" data-end="1357"&gt;There is also a hypothesis that episodic memory requires language to describe them and a “sense of self” to relate to them. Since these skills don’t fully develop until around age three or four, the brain might not yet have the tools to organise and retrieve memories in the way adults do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1359" data-end="1665"&gt;Some researchers also think the process of forgetting might serve a developmental purpose. By letting go of specific early experiences, the brain might be better able to focus on building general knowledge – to understand how the world works, for example – without being distracted by detailed memories which no longer serve a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="can-some-people-remember-events-from-infancy"&gt;Can some people remember events from infancy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people claim they can remember being a baby, but there is no evidence that what they describe are genuine episodic memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Yale and Columbia study, this belief typically stems from a psychological process called “source misattribution”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People may remember information, such as that they cried during their first haircut, but not where that information came from. They might unconsciously attribute the memory to personal experience when it actually came from a photo, family stories or a parent’s retelling. Over time, the line between “real” and “reconstructed” has blurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows that early family stories, frequent photo viewings or cultural emphasis on early development can all contribute to this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yale is currently conducting a new study in which parents will film their babies regularly, either with their phones angled from the baby’s point of view or by using head-mounted cameras on toddlers. Later, as the children grow older, the researchers will show the children these old videos to see if they recognise the experiences, primarily by monitoring brain activity, to find out how long early memories can last, Yates told Al Jazeera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="could-early-memories-be-recalled-later-in-life"&gt;Could early memories be recalled later in life?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is debate about whether early life memories are completely erased or have simply become inaccessible and could eventually be recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yates said that while the latest study does not answer this question, preliminary evidence from other research at the Yale lab shows that early life memories can be recalled in early childhood, but not later childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think the idea that at least some of our early life memories may exist in some form in our brains as adults is fascinating,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of adult rodents have shown that early memories can be brought back through approaches such as optogenetics – activating the specific brain cells which are believed to store those memories. This works by identifying the brain cells involved in forming a memory, then later using light to reactivate those same cells, causing the animal to recall the memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Techniques such as optogenetics cannot yet be used in humans, but the study of rodents suggests that the process by which we retrieve memories is where the issue lies, rather than whether the memories exist at all, according to Paul Frankland, senior scientist at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps there are natural conditions where these early life memories become more accessible,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychoanalysts such as Sigmund Freud believed that early childhood memories are not lost but buried deep in the unconscious, and that psychotherapy might help bring them to the surface by changing mental states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Frankland said that this is a “controversial area” as “it is difficult to verify the veracity of recovered memories”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera English</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 11:26:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNV1lDVnh1VHJ5UnNUYzZMeldGcnBULXNRQlo3Qkl6bld0YWVGcnlST1VrZE81aFEyc2Q0NEF3ck9rOUxydGFtUGd6dTNNZTdjaEw5Rm11c0tfYmZiZ1ROU1V5d2VfaUFSWDFtdjB4Z3gwQmRzM01IR19qSDZBSkJ1QUlPdmFDQjVraV9fUGU4RHVvTHY5eFhldGJvekJWSzB0R1BLSXBhQjRjMmRO0gGyAUFVX3lxTE45bzZpbTNLNVd0MXlJa2hPU1gyTXR4UVZCTkhZOFlyRmZ0M0ctX3g1Nl9yRUx5UkhmOWlqc0ZucTJwbXpzRzdoUDhxSDZNTHE0TTE1UlNVb3hON0pQek50Qk9jQXdZc0RqaUtCa2VkbW9lcW11U1QxNE44aVRvZXJsOEpyY0MyQ1A4VUZIVlMwNFc4U3ZHZnI0SkF0OFc1LWluOFQ5dndzalphZFBnTFpTQkE</guid></item><item><title>'Rucking' Is The Latest Walking Trend You Need To Try.

Specifically, rucking benefits your “cardiac output, it’s going to help with the efficiency of your heart pumping the blood out,” Welch explained. This can help lower your blood pressure and improve your heart rate, so it’s a win-win all around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also good for your posture and back strength. “The ruck is kind of pulling you back, so it really forces you to maintain your posture,” Welch said, who added that it’s a good way to offset the hours and hours and hours of sitting you likely do every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Going for a walk with a weighted backpack or rucksack on your back is a good way to add resistance training to your walk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plus, rucking is good for your mental health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucking is an exercise you do outdoors, and getting outside in itself is great for your mental health. According to &lt;a href="https://mhanational.org/surroundings/outdoors-nature" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mental Health America" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58514e4b0d06e412d4dc9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://mhanational.org/surroundings/outdoors-nature" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Mental Health America&lt;/a&gt;, getting outside is linked to lower levels of stress and a better mood overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="the body produces vitamin D" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58514e4b0d06e412d4dc9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;the body produces vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; when exposed to sunlight, which is important for bone health and can even help &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9468237/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="curb depression and anxiety symptoms" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58514e4b0d06e412d4dc9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9468237/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;curb depression and anxiety symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re going to always say you never come back from a ruck in a bad mood. It gives you time to clear your head,” Cihlar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are simple ways you can start rucking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting rucking doesn’t have to be complicated. “What’s nice is you can literally start with a backpack you have in your closet and ... throw some magazines in it ... your water bottle,” Cihlar explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also get a rucksack and rucksack weights if you want to use something that is officially made for the sport. Both experts said a rucksack is preferable because it’s safer. A regular backpack can sit pretty low on your back, which can cause issues if you’re carrying around a heavy bag. If you do decide to opt for a backpack, just make sure it isn’t sagging too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to how much weight you’ll want to carry on your back, that depends on your strength level and your size. “I always say start low because you can always grow from there,” Cihlar said. “You don’t want to start heavy and get discouraged.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t a frequent exerciser or weightlifter, starting with just 5 or 10 pounds and building on that is a good idea, she said. As for distance, start with a mile and see how you feel, Cihlar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, if you’re someone that is regularly active and you lift weights, you could probably do a 20-pound plate, a 30-pound plate in your ruck,” Cihlar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting with a mile is a good idea here, too, said Welch, but you can bump it up to a mile and a half or more if you don’t feel challenged. For an additional challenge, take your workout to hilly terrain, Welch added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

&lt;p&gt;Leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered staff this week not to release their experts’ assessment that found the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an aborted plan to roll out the news, the agency would have emphasized the importance of vaccinating people against the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease that has spread to 19 states, the records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CDC spokesperson told ProPublica in a written statement that the agency decided against releasing the assessment “because it does not say anything that the public doesn’t already know.” She added that the CDC continues to recommend vaccines as “the best way to protect against measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what the nation’s top public health agency said next shows a shift in its long-standing messaging about vaccines, a sign that it may be falling in line under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” the statement said, echoing a line from a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;column Kennedy wrote&lt;/a&gt; for the Fox News website. “People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProPublica shared the new CDC statement about personal choice and risk with Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. To her, the shift in messaging, and the squelching of this routine announcement, is alarming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m a bit stunned by that language,” Nuzzo said. “No vaccine is without risk, but that makes it sound like it’s a very active coin toss of a decision. We’ve already had more cases of measles in 2025 than we had in 2024, and it’s spread to multiple states. It is not a coin toss at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years, the CDC hasn’t minced words on vaccines. It &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html"&gt;promoted them with confidence&lt;/a&gt;. One campaign was called “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/ad-council-flu-campaign.htm"&gt;Get My Flu Shot&lt;/a&gt;.” The agency’s website &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/hcp/conversation-tips/index.html"&gt;told medical providers&lt;/a&gt; they play a critical role in helping parents choose vaccines for their children: “Instead of saying ‘What do you want to do about shots?,’ say ‘Your child needs three shots today.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuzzo wishes the CDC’s forecasters would put out more details of their data and evidence on the spread of measles, not less. “The growing scale and severity of this measles outbreak and the urgent need for more data to guide the response underscores why we need a fully staffed and functional CDC and more resources for state and local health departments,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s agency oversees the CDC and on Thursday announced it was poised to eliminate 2,400 jobs there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked what role, if any, Kennedy played in the decision to not release the risk assessment, HHS’s communications director said the aborted announcement “was part of an ongoing process to improve communication processes—nothing more, nothing less.” The CDC, he reiterated, continues to recommend vaccination “as the best way to protect against measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Secretary Kennedy believes that the decision to vaccinate is a personal one and that people should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine,” Andrew G. Nixon said. “It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal healthcare decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to questions about criticism of the decision among some CDC staff, Nixon wrote, “Some individuals at the CDC seem more interested in protecting their own status or agenda rather than aligning with this Administration and the true mission of public health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s risk assessment was carried out by its Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which relied, in part, on new disease data from the outbreak in Texas. The CDC created the center to address a major shortcoming laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic. It functions like a National Weather Service for infectious diseases, harnessing data and expertise to predict the course of outbreaks like a meteorologist warns of storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other risk assessments by the center have been posted by the CDC even though their conclusions might seem obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late February, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/h5-risk-assessment.html"&gt;forecasters analyzing the spread of H5N1&lt;/a&gt; bird flu said people who come “in contact with potentially infected animals or contaminated surfaces or fluids” faced a moderate to high risk of contracting the disease. The risk to the general US population, they said, was low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the measles assessment, modelers at the center determined the risk of the disease for the general public in the US is low, but they found the risk is high in communities with low vaccination rates that are near outbreaks or share close social ties to those areas with outbreaks. The CDC had moderate confidence in the assessment, according to an internal Q&amp;amp;A that explained the findings. The agency, it said, lacks detailed data about the onset of the illness for all patients in West Texas and is still learning about the vaccination rates in affected communities as well as travel and social contact among those infected. (The H5N1 assessment was also made with moderate confidence.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal plan to roll out the news of the forecast called for the expert physician who’s leading the CDC’s response to measles to be the chief spokesperson answering questions. “It is important to note that at local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist even in areas with high vaccination coverage overall,” the plan said. “The best way to protect against measles is to get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, though, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 483, more than 30 agency staff were told in an email that after a discussion in the CDC director’s office, “leadership does not want to pursue putting this on the website.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cancellation was “not normal at all,” said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal with layoffs looming. “I’ve never seen a rollout plan that was canceled at that far along in the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety among CDC staff has been building over whether the agency will bend its public health messages to match those of Kennedy, a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine group and referred clients to a law firm suing a vaccine manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS halted the CDC campaign that encouraged people to get flu shots during a ferocious flu season. On the night that the Trump administration began firing probationary employees across the federal government, some key CDC flu webpages were taken down. Remnants of some of the campaign webpages were restored after &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated"&gt;NPR reported&lt;/a&gt; this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some at the agency felt like the new leadership had sent a message loud and clear: When next to nobody was paying attention, long-standing public health messages could be silenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day in February that the world learned that an unvaccinated &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/R8XT-4XUB"&gt;child had died&lt;/a&gt; of measles in Texas, the first such death in the U.S. since 2015, the HHS secretary &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/"&gt;downplayed the seriousness&lt;/a&gt; of the outbreak. “We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview on Fox News this month, Kennedy championed doctors in Texas who he said were treating measles with a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, a supplement that is high in vitamin A. “They’re seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As parents near the outbreak in Texas stocked up on vitamin A supplements, doctors there raced to assure parents that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doctors-push-back-parents-embrace-kennedy-vitamin-texas-measles-outbreak-2025-03-08/"&gt;only vaccination, not the vitamin, can prevent measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the CDC added &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;an entry on Vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; to its measles website for clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, CNN reported that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/texas-measles-vitamin-a-toxicity/index.html"&gt;several hospitalized children in Lubbock, Texas, had abnormal liver function&lt;/a&gt;, a likely sign of toxicity from too much vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas health officials also said that the Trump administration’s decision to rescind $11 billion in pandemic-related grants across the country &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/26/texas-measles-public-health-funding-cut/"&gt;will hinder their ability to respond&lt;/a&gt; to the growing outbreak, according to The Texas Tribune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is among the most contagious diseases and can be dangerous. About 20 percent of unvaccinated people who get measles wind up in the hospital. And &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children&lt;/a&gt; with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. The virus can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html"&gt;linger in the air&lt;/a&gt; for two hours after an infected person has left an area, and patients can spread measles before they even know they have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week Amtrak said it was notifying customers that they may have been exposed to the disease this month when a passenger with measles &lt;a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/amtrak-confirms-passenger-measles-traveled-new-york-washington-dc/16085440/"&gt;rode one of its trains&lt;/a&gt; from New York City to Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;

The first is called primary vaccine failure, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"That is that small subset of people that just don't form an immune response to the measles vaccine," she told ABC News. "So, after your first dose of the vaccine, it's thought that maybe 7% of people won't have an immune response, and the second shot is thought to really cover most of those people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Then there is secondary vaccine failure, which is when somebody has an insufficient response to the vaccine over time or waning of the immune response, Arrington said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This may occur in older people, who have immune systems that weaken over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccinologist and co-director of The Atria Research Institute -- which focuses on disease prevention -- said other reasons for breakthrough cases include someone being genetically predisposed or the MMR vaccine not being stored at the right temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The reason that people who got one or maybe two doses of vaccine and yet still got infected, I've written extensively about this, is the vaccine might not have been handled properly," he said.

			&lt;p&gt;Hard on the heels of impressive research findings that a glass of milk is &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-a-daily-glass-of-milk-really-could-reduce-bowel-cancer-risk-an-oncologist-explains-247301"&gt;good for reducing cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;, another &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2452237"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; has highlighted the potential benefits of yoghurt consumption in lowering the risk of certain types of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="156617" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; – particularly colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of new colorectal cancer cases among people under 55 has doubled globally in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37222697/"&gt;recent years&lt;/a&gt;, with diagnoses &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30520562/"&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; by nearly 20%. As a consultant oncologist, many people have asked me how their risk can be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2452237"&gt;emerging evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests that regular yoghurt consumption may have a protective effect against certain aggressive forms of colorectal cancer by modifying the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/uk/topics/gut-microbiome-1624"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, the natural bacteria that live in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in overall health, influencing digestion, immune function and even cancer risk. The gut bacteria can live &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35427497/"&gt;inside&lt;/a&gt; cancer itself, and in general a healthy balance of these bacteria is thought to be essential for maintaining a &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00158-8"&gt;strong immune system&lt;/a&gt; and preventing inflammation, which can contribute to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bug-drugs-bacteria-based-cancer-therapies-are-finally-overcoming-barriers-251278"&gt;cancer development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2VdZwUmVlY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y&lt;span&gt;oghurt contains live cultures of beneficial bacteria, such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/digestive-health/lactobacillus-bulgaricus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;lactobacillus bulgaricus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Probiotics-HealthProfessional/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;streptococcus thermophilus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which can help maintain this balance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that consuming two or more servings of yoghurt per week was associated with a lower risk of a specific type of aggressive colorectal cancer, which occurs on the right side of the colon and is associated with poorer survival outcomes compared with cancers on the left side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study analysed data from over 150,000 participants followed for several decades, indicating that long-term yoghurt consumption may alter the gut microbiome in ways that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-022-00974-4"&gt;protect&lt;/a&gt; against certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers surveyed the participants every two years about their yoghurt intake, and measured the amount of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10869629/"&gt;a type of bacteria found in yoghurt&lt;/a&gt;) in the tumour tissue of 3,079 people within the sample who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While yoghurt did not directly lower the risk for all types of colorectal cancer, those who ate two or more servings of yoghurt per week had a lower risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2452237#abstract"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;-positive proximal colon cancer"&lt;/a&gt;, a type of colorectal cancer that occurs in the right side of the colon and has one of the lowest survival rates. This new work also validates and builds on &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7727484/"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; showing similar findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how yoghurt might reduce cancer risk. One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26846801/"&gt;key mechanism&lt;/a&gt; is the modulation of the gut &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2464945?src=recsys"&gt;microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoghurt's probiotics can enhance the diversity and balance of gut bacteria, potentially &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7913863/"&gt;reducing inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and levels of cancer-causing chemicals (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9915879/"&gt;carcinogens&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, yoghurt may exert anti-inflammatory effects on the colon lining cells, called the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10030639/"&gt;mucosa&lt;/a&gt;, which could help prevent cancer development. Improving gut barrier function is another potential mechanism, as yoghurt may reduce &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28091645/"&gt;gut permeability&lt;/a&gt;, which is linked to increased cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choose wisely&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond its potential anti-cancer effects, yoghurt offers several other health benefits. Like milk, it is rich in calcium, which supports bone density and may &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3641848/"&gt;reduce the risk&lt;/a&gt; of brittle bones, known as osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular yoghurt consumption has also been associated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6613217/"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and reduced risk of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29462263/"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;. Some studies suggest that yoghurt intake may help prevent &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28615384/"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and other diseases too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when incorporating yoghurt into your diet, it's important to choose wisely. Opt for plain, unflavored yoghurt to avoid added sugars, which can negate health benefits – for example by causing weight gain, which is a risk factor for obesity and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30506248/"&gt;fermentation processes&lt;/a&gt; can result in varying levels of beneficial bacteria, so look for yoghurts with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24695895/"&gt;live cultures&lt;/a&gt;. Plain, unsweetened Greek yoghurt is generally higher in protein and lower in sugar, while full-fat yoghurt often has fewer processed ingredients than reduced-fat or non-fat variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoghurt contains all nine essential amino acids, and aside from improving gut health, a serving of plain Greek yoghurt contains 15 to 20 grams of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609537/"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are nearly 45,000 cases of bowel cancer every year in the UK, making it the nation's fourth most common cancer, and third &lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/72/2/338"&gt;worldwide&lt;/a&gt; – but many of these are &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/bowel-cancer"&gt;preventable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R6OR_SpmAGI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cancer Research UK &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/bowel-cancer#heading-Three"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;, 54 percent of all bowel cancers could be prevented by having a healthier lifestyle. Smoking, lack of exercise, alcohol, eating processed meat, and poor diet are all &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016508518349424"&gt;significant factors&lt;/a&gt; in the development of bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emerging evidence suggests that yoghurt, particularly when consumed regularly, may play a role in reducing the risk of certain aggressive forms of colorectal cancer. While more research is needed to fully understand these effects, incorporating yoghurt into a balanced diet could be a beneficial choice for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as with any dietary recommendation, it's crucial to consider the broader context of a healthy lifestyle, including a diverse diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, along with regular physical activity. While yoghurt is not a magic bullet against cancer, it is a nutritious food that can contribute to a healthy diet and potentially offer protective effects against certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As research continues to uncover the complex relationships between diet, gut health and cancer risk, incorporating yoghurt into your daily routine may be a simple yet beneficial step towards a healthier life.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/251942/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Plastics have improved modern life in countless ways, but the ultimate price of this convenience is only now coming clearly into focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have reached the point as a society where researchers have begun looking beyond the environmental hazards of plastic pollution to uncover hidden connections between plastic exposure and human well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions are emerging about how microplastics might be &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-chewing-gum-may-be-full-of-microplastics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;affecting our bodies&lt;/a&gt; and whether this is something we should address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some everyday items, such as water bottles, may contribute far more than trash. They could be releasing tiny plastic particles that slip into our bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early studies suggest that plastic particles are influencing human &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/study-reveals-over-2000-genetic-markers-that-affect-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, a condition linked to serious cardiovascular problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Johanna Fischer from the Department of Medicine at &lt;a href="https://www.dp-uni.ac.at/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Danube Private University&lt;/a&gt; in Austria, a few recent findings have sparked new debates about what happens when microplastics flow through our bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tiny-pieces-of-plastic-wreaking-havoc"&gt;Tiny pieces of plastic wreaking havoc&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics measure less than 5 mm, arising from the breakdown of larger plastics or from everyday sources like car tires and synthetic clothing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have been detected in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-pose-a-greater-threat-to-some-ocean-animals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;food, water, and the air&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists have identified them in the placenta, in certain organs, and even in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their presence has raised concerns because they might trigger inflammation or hormonal imbalances. By entering daily routines unnoticed, these microscopic bits could pose health hazards that are still under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent work has pointed to an unexpected culprit for high blood pressure. Their investigations indicate that common water bottles can release particles into the liquid we drink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to preliminary insights, microplastics can migrate into our system, with potential effects on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-smell-control-your-blood-pressure-new-research-says-yes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood pressure measurements&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators also discovered these minute fragments in glass containers, which complicates efforts to avoid them altogether. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This points to a wider issue that stretches beyond visible waste and calls for innovative approaches to monitoring exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plastics-linked-to-blood-pressure"&gt;Plastics linked to blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight healthy adults took part in a project aimed at exploring any links between plastics and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were asked to rely on tap water instead of bottled drinks for about a month. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/black-gold-the-vitamin-packed-fruit-that-regulates-blood-sugar-and-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; readings were collected at the outset, after two weeks, and at the end of four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings indicated that women showed a noticeable dip in blood pressure levels, particularly in diastolic readings, while men did not exhibit the same changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One explanation might be that only three men participated. That small number makes it difficult to form broad conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the overall data hint that cutting back on plastics could influence cardiovascular health by reducing the number of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-are-widespread-in-the-seafood-we-eat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plastic particles&lt;/a&gt; present in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research group emphasizes that larger trials are needed. They aim to measure the actual concentration of microplastics in the blood, providing a clearer picture of how plastic exposure might relate to changes in blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-pressure-and-plastics-the-results"&gt;Blood pressure and plastics – the results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We concluded, after extensive research, that beverages packaged in plastic bottles should be avoided,” the research team warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes observed in blood pressure suggest that reducing the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-in-the-brain-alarming-new-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;intake of plastic particles&lt;/a&gt; could lower cardiovascular risk, emphasizing how these findings may fit into the bigger picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these scientists, a lower exposure to plastics seems to correlate with improvements in some blood pressure markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By stating that “plastic particles &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-found-in-every-semen-sample-tested/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;present in the bloodstream&lt;/a&gt; could contribute to increased blood pressure,” the team highlighted a potential link between microplastics and cardiovascular concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although their study involved only a small group, they view the results as a motivation to investigate these interactions further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the precise pathways remain unclear, the prospect that tiny plastic fragments might affect blood pressure and overall cardiovascular health should encourage us all to rethink these common habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-next"&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because hypertension is a leading cause of heart complications, any factor that might raise blood pressure deserves scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans already face multiple risks for cardiovascular disease, so identifying one that might be avoidable is compelling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting bottled beverages or opting for tap water in reusable non-plastic containers will definitely help reduce exposure, though additional verification is needed to confirm the long-term impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewing many different studies, it’s very clear that microplastics have infiltrated every nook and cranny of our bodies, natural environments, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sounding-the-alarm-microplastics-are-disrupting-photosynthesis-around-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;global ecosystems at large&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of high blood pressure and other cardiovascular health issues that arise from the consumption of microplastics, scientists and physicians are concerned about inflammation, endocrine problems, and oxidative stress, all of which can harm overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the convenience of disposable products is tempting, making a personal choice of removing single-use plastics from our everyday lives will undoubtedly yield benefits – both for our health and the global environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8929/3/3/26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Microplastics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?

      &lt;p&gt;Measles spreads quickly in communities where vaccination rates are low - and vaccine hesitancy has been on the rise for years.  But amid a growing outbreak in Texas, vaccine enthusiasm is growing, as parents try to get their kids vaccinated early.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AILSA CHANG, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Measles is now spreading in five states - Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio and Oklahoma. Most of the cases are in West Texas, which reported today that they have had 400 cases since the outbreak started. Measles spreads quickly in communities with low vaccination rates, and vaccine hesitancy has been on the rise for years. But now, some pediatricians are seeing vaccine enthusiasm. NPR's Maria Godoy is here to tell us more. Hi, Maria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARIA GODOY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANG: OK, so what are the latest numbers we're seeing right now on measles?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: Well, today, Texas reported 77 new cases just since Tuesday, which just goes to show how contagious measles is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANG: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: Yeah. Health officials there are expecting more cases, and as you noted, the virus is now spreading in other states. New Mexico has 44 cases. Kansas has 23. So there's concern that the virus will keep spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANG: And do most cases involve people who are not vaccinated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: Correct. The vast majority are not vaccinated. But here's something interesting. While we're hearing a lot about parents who don't want to vaccinate their kids, pediatricians I've been talking to are also hearing from worried parents who want their kids to get their vaccines early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANG: What do you mean by early?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: So normally, kids get their first measles vaccine between 12 and 15 months and then a second dose between 4 and 6 years. But the CDC says in certain situations, you can get the measles vaccine as young as 6 months, like if you're traveling abroad or are in an outbreak area. I spoke with Dr. Shannon Fox-Levine. She's a pediatrician in Broward County, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHANNON FOX-LEVINE: Our call center is - was inundated with calls about, you know, MMR vaccine. Is their child up to date? Should they get another vaccine? Should they get an extra one? Can they get it early?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: And this is in Florida, where vaccine hesitancy has been growing, so Fox-Levine says hearing vaccine enthusiasm is exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANG: And why do you think there has been an uptick in enthusiasm?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: Well, two things - parents are watching what's happening with these outbreaks, and they're worried that measles will spread to where they live. You know, it is spring break season now, so people are traveling, and if you have kids who are too young for the vaccine, you might worry that you could run into someone with measles or that someone with measles could travel to your community. So these are the concerns pediatricians are hearing, but there's also politics at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANG: What do you mean? Like, what kind of politics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: Well, several pediatricians told me they're hearing from parents who are worried about the future of vaccine access. These are parents who watch the news. They know that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been a longtime critic of vaccines. Here's Dr. Susan Sirota. She's a pediatrician in the Chicago area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUSAN SIROTA: There's a bit of fear among moms and dads and parents about their ability to protect their children and to prevent diseases because vaccine access is in question for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: And, you know, it's not just the measles vaccine. Sirota says some patients are worried about access to the HPV vaccine, which protects against cervical cancer. Kennedy has been involved in legal challenges to that vaccine. Now, during his confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he wouldn't take vaccines away from anyone. He's called them a personal choice. We did reach out to HHS for comment. They did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANG: That is NPR's Maria Godoy. Thank you so much, Maria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: My pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Using PET imaging, they found that dopamine levels spike in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex when people switch between tasks — and the more dopamine released, the more efficiently they adapted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This confirms a biochemical link between dopamine and the brain’s ability to adjust behavior in response to changing demands. The discovery may help refine treatments for disorders like Parkinson’s, depression, ADHD, and schizophrenia, which often impair flexible thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine &amp;amp; Adaptability:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher dopamine release correlates with better task switching.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Region Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; PET scans showed dopamine activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may guide treatments for psychiatric and neurological disorders with impaired cognitive flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SNMMI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the first time, scientists have confirmed a neurobiochemical link between dopamine and cognitive flexibility, according to new research published in the March issue of &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Nuclear Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PET imaging shows that the brain increases dopamine production when completing cognitively demanding tasks, and that the more dopamine released, the more efficiently the tasks are completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108271"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dopamine release was calculated using the linearized simplified reference region model which compares the two task blocks with each other. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with this information, physicians may soon be able to develop more precise treatment strategies for neurological and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive flexibility is the ability to adapt one’s thinking and behavior appropriately to a changing environment and is considered an aspect of executive function. Cognitive flexibility differs among people and is reported to be impaired in several psychiatric and neurologic disorders, such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, addiction, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the neurotransmitter level, the dopamine system has been linked to cognitive flexibility. A direct neurochemical response to cognitive flexibility, however, has yet to be shown,” said Isabelle Miederer, PhD, associate professor in experimental nuclear medicine in the department of nuclear medicine at University Medical Center Mainz, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our study, we sought to examine the release of dopamine in real-time by performing PET scans while individuals completed behavioral flexibility tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteen participants were scanned with the D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor ligand &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fallypride in a two-part block study design. In the first part, participants performed two tasks consecutively on a computer screen without rule switching while undergoing PET imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second part of the PET scan, participants had to switch flexibly between two task rules. Dopamine release was calculated using the linearized simplified reference region model which compares the two task blocks with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PET imaging analysis showed a displacement of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fallypride in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during the task switching (higher cognitive demand) part of the study, which is assumed to be the release of dopamine. Results also showed that the greater dopamine release, the more efficient participants were in switching between tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The present findings emphasize the significance of dopamine in cognitive flexibility,” said Mathias Schreckenberger, MD, head of the department of nuclear medicine at University Medical Center Mainz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are consistent with the results of previous clinical studies indicating that dopamine deficiency in disorders such as Parkinson’s disease may cause behavioral deficits in cognitive flexibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking forward, it is expected that the results of the study will contribute to a better understanding of the neurochemical mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility and thus facilitate the development of treatment strategies to improve flexibility in neurological and psychiatric disorders,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this dopamine and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#85f7e8e4fde0fcc5f6ebe8e8ecabeaf7e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rebecca Maxey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://snmmi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SNMMI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Rebecca Maxey – SNMMI&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.124.268317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dopaminergic Mechanisms of Cognitive Flexibility: An [18F]Fallypride PET Study&lt;/a&gt;” by Isabelle Miederer et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Nuclear Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopaminergic Mechanisms of Cognitive Flexibility: An [18F]Fallypride PET Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive flexibility is the ability to appropriately adapt one’s thinking and behavior to changing environmental demands and is conceptualized as an aspect of executive function. The dopamine system has been implicated in cognitive flexibility; however, a direct, that is, neurochemical, link to cognitive flexibility has not been shown yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate how cognitive flexibility is mediated by dopaminergic signaling in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; Eighteen participants were measured in a PET study with 174 ± 12 MBq of the D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor ligand [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fallypride in a block design with 2 parts. While participants processed 2 tasks sequentially without rule switching on a computer screen in the first part of the PET scan, they had to flexibly switch between the 2 task rules after 100 min after injection in the second part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine release (γ) was quantified using the linearized simplified reference region model contrasting the 2 task blocks (switching vs. no-switching/baseline). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; The statistical analysis of the parametric γ-images showed that the increased cognitive demand during task switching induced a displacement of the D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor ligand [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fallypride in the vmPFC (maximum T value = 13.8; cluster size: 528 voxels; familywise error rate–corrected &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; mean γ = 0.022 ± 0.006 min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, a correlation between behavioral switch costs and vmPFC [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fallypride displacement suggested that participants showing greater dopamine release were more efficient in task switching. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; To our knowledge, this is the first experimental PET study to show direct involvement of dopamine in the vmPFC in a task-switching paradigm, confirming model assumptions about the neurochemical basis of cognitive flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 22:32:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE1sZUlteXlHOFp6dDFZM1JpcE9UdF95c0lfZDVWTkEteDlpeUhTQ29mRXR3TU1XSWJIcTJITUl1RkZWTmlvcjhFdGdXZWdVLWNFWU5XektoUllVRGpxOXlzRnNqVlZGb2J5SWVVUWVOa2Y2OGJE</guid></item><item><title>You’re not eating enough protein if you have these 6 symptoms - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost every bodily function depends on protein. Every element of your body, including your hair and bones, contains proteins. They aid in the production and maintenance of cells, which are essential for development and growth. It is essential for the synthesis of enzymes, hormones, and antibodies and is a key component of muscles, skin, hair, and nails. However, a typical nutritional gap is a lack of protein. The following are the 6 typical indicators that your diet is lacking in protein: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weakness and fatigue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sunil Rana, Associate Director and Head- Internal Medicine, Asian Hospital says, “Your body uses weakness and fatigue to indicate a protein shortage. Fatigue, low energy, and general weakness might result from your body not getting enough protein. Your body may not be getting enough protein to support your daily energy levels if you feel exhausted all the time, even after you've rested. “ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weak hair, skin and nails&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since proteins make up the majority of hair, skin, and nails, the condition of these tissues is one of the most obvious indicators of a deficit. You can have thinning hair or easily broken nails. Proteins like keratin, collagen, and elastin make up skin, hair, and nails. You may have dry and flaky skin, deep ridges on your fingernails, and brittle or thinning hair when your body is unable to produce them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Slow wound healing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dt. Debjani Banerjee, Incharge Dietetics, PSRI Hospital, “Slow wound healing and recurrent illness are two other typical signs of a protein shortage. Swelling (also known as edema), particularly in the hands, legs, feet, and abdomen, is one of the most typical indicators that you aren't receiving enough protein. Edema can be caused by a variety of factors, so be careful to consult your physician if you suspect something more serious. Your immune system may be compromised by a severe protein shortage. Protein aids in the production of antibodies, which guard against infections and other diseases. A lack of protein results in fewer antibodies, which raises your risk of infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mood swings&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, proteins are essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters that control mood and mental acuity. Mood fluctuations, impatience, and trouble focusing can all be caused by a protein shortage. Another typical sign of a protein shortage is mood swings. To convey information between cells, your brain employs chemicals called neurotransmitters, which are composed of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Therefore, eating too little protein would alter how your brain functions. For instance, you can experience depression or excessive aggression if your dopamine and serotonin levels are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uncontrolled cravings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent snack cravings, particularly for savory or sweet meals, may be your body's way of indicating a protein shortage. Your body uses skeletal muscle tissue as fuel when there is insufficient protein. Muscular atrophy, or a loss of muscular mass, results from this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Poor muscle mass&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, sustaining muscle mass, particularly as we age, requires protein. The body starts to break down muscular tissue for energy when it doesn't obtain enough protein from diet. Since muscles support and cushion the joints, this can result in muscular atrophy, weakening, and even joint discomfort. Insufficient protein intake may be the cause of joint pain or muscle loss. It frequently takes longer for cuts and scratches to heal in those who consume little protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprains and other injuries associated with exercise appear to be no different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;10 symptoms you're having too much screen time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.’s Faulty Advice On Bird Flu - FactCheck.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE9pZVJyMnE0MUdNZTBiVF9oZ0JFTndRVzFiWXdTek4yNTRjaE5Yd3daN2pma1hjYTRudXFxOW8zUGwycmZJZXhnX25QRE9VRk54cUNjTUhwSm1vdUZpcVMwQVdTM2puNXZIN3RaQzFwNTBsN3M3akQtWA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent news appearances, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/person/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; has suggested allowing bird flu to spread in poultry flocks unchecked. Scientists &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; that’s risky because it gives the virus more opportunities to replicate, increasing the chance it could change to spread easily among humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Avian influenza, or bird flu, has been &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/05/qa-on-h5n1-bird-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;spreading&lt;/a&gt; in U.S. dairy cows for more than a year now and has &lt;a href="https://archive.is/aFE8n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;infected&lt;/a&gt; several dozen dairy workers. The virus also has &lt;a href="https://archive.is/YHEcz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;infected&lt;/a&gt; flocks of chickens and other poultry in the U.S. since 2022, leading to the deaths of more than 168 million birds, infections in poultry workers and high &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/qa-on-egg-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;egg prices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“We’ve in fact said to [the U.S. Department of Agriculture] that they should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds and preserve the birds that are immune to it,” Kennedy said of bird flu in an &lt;a href="https://nation.foxnews.com/watch/d5c0ee929861616db083854daa058a56/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel. The conversation aired March 4 on Fox Nation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most of our scientists are against the culling operation,” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in an interview with Sean Hannity, which aired on Fox News March 11. Kennedy advocated testing therapeutics in flocks and again suggested looking for birds with “a genetic inclination for immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have acknowledged that culling on its own &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-02-26/poultry-culling-hasnt-stopped-h5n1-bird-flu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;has not stopped&lt;/a&gt; bird flu from infecting poultry. But they &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/birdflu/114731" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; is risky and unlikely to yield a breakthrough in the search for bird flu therapeutics or genetic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If someone is going to say well, we should let the virus just go unchecked and follow RFK Jr.’s suggestion, we’re going to exacerbate the problem,” &lt;a href="https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty/maurice-ernest-pitesky" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Maurice Pitesky&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at University of California, Davis, Veterinary Medicine Cooperative Extension, told us. “There’s no scenario where that is a good idea.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Why do we want to give the virus a leg up? Why do we want to give it an advantage and let it do its worst without being checked?” &lt;a href="https://www.pirbright.ac.uk/our-science/scientists/prof-ian-brown-obe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ian Brown&lt;/a&gt;, group leader of avian virology at the Pirbright Institute in the U.K., asked us. “That doesn’t feel terribly logical.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Letting bird flu run through poultry flocks is “not advisable and this will cause serious harm to poultry and put other animals at risk, but also humans who will have to manage the culling/clean-up, which poses a huge biosecurity risk,” &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/popescu-saskia/"&gt;Saskia Popescu&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, told us in an email.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Kennedy left out important context about the risk of bird flu. And he misleadingly claimed that vaccinating poultry would turn birds into “mutation factories,” when researchers say that vaccinating birds could be one possible way of mitigating agricultural harm and reducing risks to people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is in charge of HHS, not the USDA, so it is unclear how much his views will influence the policy on culling or vaccinating birds. On the human health side, lawmakers and scientists recently have raised concerns that HHS is threatening pandemic preparedness by pulling back &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-government-pulls-back-over-11-billion-funding-state-health-departments-2025-03-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;funding to states&lt;/a&gt; being used to control infectious disease, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/politics/health-department-job-layoffs-rfk-jr.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;embarking on&lt;/a&gt; a massive reduction in HHS staff and reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/hhs-moderna-vaccine-contract-bird-flu-pandemic-preparedness-worries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reevaluating&lt;/a&gt; a contract for research into bird flu mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins in a Feb. 26 Fox News &lt;a href="https://x.com/AmericaNewsroom/status/1894798813681827949" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; indicated USDA might try out a pilot program to build a “safe perimeter” around some flocks to “see if there is a way forward where the immunity and the genetics and the DNA become part of this.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the USDA affirmed to us via email that its policy is still to require culling. “The United States will continue to follow our established stamping out policy,” in keeping with international &lt;a href="https://www.woah.org/en/what-we-do/standards/codes-and-manuals/terrestrial-code-online-access/?id=169&amp;amp;L=1&amp;amp;htmfile=chapitre_avian_influenza_viruses.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, an agency spokesperson said, and also will work to “develop innovative strategies (including alternative response activities) and ensure we use every tool at our disposal” to fight bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In late February, the USDA &lt;a href="https://archive.is/HY0SY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a $1 billion strategy to combat bird flu, which &lt;a href="https://archive.is/rSXDT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;includes&lt;/a&gt; funds dedicated to developing vaccines for poultry and for improving biosecurity on farms. Good biosecurity can help prevent bird flu from being introduced to farms in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letting Bird Flu Spread in Poultry Is Risky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;H5N1 bird flu — the type causing the current outbreak in the U.S. — spreads rapidly in chickens and is &lt;a href="https://archive.is/WhPDJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;highly lethal&lt;/a&gt;. USDA &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt; is to kill all the birds in a flock once H5N1 is detected. This culling process, also referred to as depopulation, reduces bird flu’s ability replicate, mutate and spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his interview with Hannity, Kennedy blamed high egg prices on culling. “We’ve killed 166 million chickens,” Kennedy said. “That’s why we have an egg crisis.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But bird flu is the root cause of the bird deaths. These birds “would die anyway if they were not depopulated,” Brown said, explaining that the “lethality is pretty close to 100%.” The hens would stop laying eggs early in their infection, he added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When infection is allowed to take its course, poultry “die quite a horrible death,” Brown said, so there is also an animal welfare issue with not culling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most likely outcome of stopping culling, Pitesky said, would be more bird deaths as the virus spread unchecked, ultimately reducing the country’s food security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The quicker you depopulate, the quicker you can prevent disease transmission from that facility to other facilities or to wild birds that are in that area that are then going to transmit the disease to other facilities,” Pitesky said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stopping culling could increase the risk of bird flu changing in dangerous ways. “The more opportunities the virus has to replicate, the more opportunities it has to mutate and reassort with all kinds of different strains,” Pitesky said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy was also wrong to almost entirely blame bird flu cases in humans on culling. “Almost all of the people who have gotten sick were workers who were involved in the culling operations,” he told Siegel. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s inaccurate,” Popescu said. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 24 out of 70 U.S. human bird flu cases cave been in people &lt;a href="https://archive.is/aFE8n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;exposed&lt;/a&gt; via poultry farms and culling operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been cases “related to culling, but this is also in relation to poultry exposure overall – culling is a necessary practice to avoid additional exposure (humans and animals), and frankly it’s a horrific illness for birds,” Popescu said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy Unlikely to Identify Flu-Resistant Chickens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers said that stopping culling in order to find resistant birds or new therapeutics was unlikely to be effective. “People have been trying to breed genetic lines that are resistant to flu for some years now and have generally failed to succeed,” Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There has been research into whether some birds might have genes that could provide flu resistance, Pitesky said, but this work is done in poultry being raised in villages in Africa and Asia that have more genetic variation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commercial chickens in the U.S. are bred to be as genetically identical as possible so that they will grow at the same rate, Pitesky added. These poultry are the “least ideal population” to test whether it’s possible to identify birds with genetic resistance to H5N1, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pitesky also said that before testing a therapeutic in the field, “you ultimately need some indication that it’s going to work.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The biggest issue is we don’t have anything in the pipeline right now, as far as I know, that there’s any indication it could be curative of a viral infection like this in poultry,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown said that there have been concerns about whether therapeutics for chickens could be cost-effective, “even if they could do the job, which I doubt.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I do think we do need to think outside the box, but that is not a viable outside-the-box scenario,” Pitesky said, referring to Kennedy’s proposal for finding resistant chickens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccinating Poultry Could Curb Bird Flu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One possible way to protect chickens would be to vaccinate them, Brown said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in his conversation with Hannity, Kennedy misleadingly dismissed vaccination as a strategy that could harm human health. “All of my agencies have advised against vaccination of birds because if you vaccinate with a leaky vaccine — in other words, a vaccine that does not provide sterilizing immunity, that does not absolutely protect against the disease — you turn those flocks into mutation factories,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown said that vaccination would reduce illness in birds and their ability to spread the virus. Bird flu vaccines do not completely prevent infection, and vaccination could favor versions of the virus that aren’t as well targeted by the vaccine. However, there isn’t evidence that vaccination would “generate some monster virus that can infect people,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Poultry vaccines are available, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/french-bird-flu-vaccine-campaign-helps-poultry-output-recover-producers-say-2025-02-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;countries&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2023/02/17/bird-flu-vaccination-policies-by-country/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; Mexico, France, Egypt and China use vaccines against bird flu in poultry. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “claim that poultry vaccination will ‘turn those birds into mutant factories’ is incorrect,” virologist &lt;a href="https://medicine.usask.ca/profiles/bmi-affiliated/angela-rasmussen.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Angela Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Saskatchewan said in a social media &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/UQK8-UZ3T" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. Vaccination in China against another type of bird flu virus, H7N9, did &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/2DZB-6XUX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;favor&lt;/a&gt; survival of flu genotypes that could evade the vaccine, she said. But researchers found that the “variants that emerged were less adapted to infect humans,” Rasmussen said, and &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/4J56-58X6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;vaccinating&lt;/a&gt; the birds “basically stopped human infections.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So yes, RNA viruses like flu can mutate &amp;amp; vaccination creates selection pressures driving their evolution,” Rasmussen &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/YJM4-JU2U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “But that doesn’t turn chickens into mutant factories &amp;amp; reduces the risk to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are policy and logistical &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/20/h5n1-bird-flu-egg-prices-former-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-biosecurity-vaccines-new-normal/"&gt;barriers&lt;/a&gt; to vaccinating chickens in the U.S. Brown explained, for instance, that some countries do not allow imports from countries that vaccinate their poultry. The laying industry in the U.S. does not have a substantial export business and is for vaccinating poultry. The meat industry, also called the broiler industry, exports large quantities of chicken and is against vaccination due to the trade embargoes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we’ve written, USDA is funding vaccine research. In response to a March 26 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a39tYB91NJs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; from Forbes about Kennedy’s poultry vaccine comments, asked during an impromptu interview outside the White House, Rollins did not comment specifically but emphasized that multiple agencies would work together to curb bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks of Bird Flu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://archive.is/E0l0E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://archive.is/HV5qd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; currently consider the risk of H5N1 bird flu to the general public to be low. However, public health experts still &lt;a href="https://archive.is/ExJxs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; that people take precautions, such as avoiding raw milk and using caution around wild birds and other potentially infected animals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists also have emphasized that the risk level of bird flu &lt;a href="https://archive.is/5dlV3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;could&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/bird-flu-america-death.html?unlocked_article_code=1.6k4.u3Jf.JV8nun8aMOP6&amp;amp;smid=url-share&amp;amp;utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;change very quickly&lt;/a&gt; if the virus changes to more readily infect and spread among humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy — who has advocated &lt;a href="https://archive.is/d1ImN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;deregulating&lt;/a&gt; raw milk in the past — left out this context in talking about the food supply. “It’s not transmitted through eggs or through dairy products,” he told Siegel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As far as we know, you cannot get it from an egg or milk or meat from an infected animal,” he said to Hannity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been no documented human cases of bird flu in the U.S. resulting from eating eggs, milk or meat. Birds with flu stop laying eggs early in the course of their infection, and the virus isn’t found in high amounts in eggs, Pitesky said. For eggs, “I’d be more concerned about salmonella than I would about avian influenza,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Dairy is different,” Pitesky said, saying that raw milk is “dangerous,” both due to the potential presence of bird flu and due to other microbes. In cows, bird flu is found at the highest levels in the udder and milk. Pasteurization kills the bird flu virus, but it has been shown to persist in raw milk and raw milk products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cats have &lt;a href="https://archive.is/f04HN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; from H5N1 bird flu after drinking raw milk. “If someone is going to tell me, let’s wait until a human dies … I’m not willing to take that chance,” Pitesky said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Raw meat pet foods have also &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/04/h5n1-avian-flu-cats-transmission-pets-companion-animals-disease-surveillance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; cats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also said that B3.13, the version of bird flu that spread to cows in late 2023, is “not very dangerous to humans,” adding that it “is not something that we’re deeply concerned about.” He said to Siegel that the D1.1 version of the virus, which has been found in wild birds and poultry and also recently spread to cow herds, is “more dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To date, the B3.13 genotype has caused mild disease in humans. D1.1 and a related version of the virus, called D1.3, have led to &lt;a href="https://archive.is/kYP5f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;three severe bird flu cases&lt;/a&gt; in humans in the U.S., including one &lt;a href="https://archive.is/LrBi7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. The severe cases occurred in two people with backyard &lt;a href="https://archive.is/SAl5P" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;poultry&lt;/a&gt; and one worker who was culling diseased poultry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, scientists cautioned against complacency in the response to any version of the virus. “It only needs to acquire a couple of mutations” to become more dangerous to humans, Brown said. “That risk profile might change.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Epidemiologists like me are wary of drawing premature conclusions about severity,” Caitlin Rivers of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health wrote in a recent New York Times &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/bird-flu-america-death.html"&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt;. She cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from small numbers of cases occurring largely in dairy workers, when people with high-risk health conditions or the very old or young might be underrepresented.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I fear that the apparent mildness of infections in the United States has confounded calls to act more decisively,” Rivers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

At least &lt;strong&gt;41 people&lt;/strong&gt; have been hospitalized so far.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An unvaccinated, but otherwise healthy child, died of measles in February, becoming the &lt;strong&gt;first measles fatality&lt;/strong&gt; in the U.S. in a decade. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just two cases have occurred in people fully vaccinated, according to the data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Friday’s updates come after the Trump administration abruptly canceled more than &lt;strong&gt;$11 billion&lt;/strong&gt; in COVID-era public health grants, a move that state and local health departments said could harm Texas’s measles response.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Departments are already operating on &lt;strong&gt;thin margins&lt;/strong&gt; and need to balance sometimes competing public health priorities. Due to the loss, some health departments are already starting to cancel contracts and lay off workers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Grants were used for information modernization, as well as to hire people to help with vaccinations, testing and disease tracking. But that work had to &lt;strong&gt;stop immediately&lt;/strong&gt;.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Philip Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, said &lt;strong&gt;grant money&lt;/strong&gt; was going to be used to help equip a new lab that is being built. The new equipment would have expanded the lab’s testing capacity for COVID-19, as well as other pathogens, like measles.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This is going to stop work in its tracks that was really important for their communities,” said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs at the National Association of County and City Health Officials.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;“Work to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in nursing homes, for example, or to be able to track measles cases … the work has to stop, and yet the needs in the community remain,” Casalotti said.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Hill</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 21:36:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNMGhlRlA3eFRieVdFX3F1SVBrQmR0blJlc2oxRHVkZW1wTDBDSnBLek9fOVlfWG9zQU1vT3pBNldCNmhmZW4wd19mZV9naE1BZVBFUzlQSjQ1OExLeHcxV2QwQ1ZIRVdnTUFEYnB2eDhEZUFMVHE0dXZJU1dxY3NDWjZxb2RzaTNvNmfSAY8BQVVfeXFMTUhLaTAxMWZleUtZeVg4cHIwNEVEY3BjdE1jS2F3QXUzXzZaTlhBOWNWN0RBRG5Yb3o4Y0FpSlJjYjgyUHhrTGZjNlJDOE0zaFgwM3o1Vk5CWU82dVVERHdWWjgzeGxJVU9EcTZoSWd5SWJXY01JdHZld0taUHVCOEN5MWVNeWx4SDYtXzFKdG8</guid></item><item><title>Is It Healthy To Eat Yogurt Every Day?

Whether we’re blitzing it into a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a39576599/blueberry-smoothie-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;smoothie&lt;/a&gt;, grabbing it from the cold case at a local cafe, or shoving a cup into our bag as we run out the door on a busy morning, we opt for it because we’re confident in its stunning nutritional resume and relative ease of consumption—especially when we’re &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/g43725813/grab-and-go-breakfast-ideas/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:on the go;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;on the go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is it possible that we’ve become overconfident? Is yogurt really the nutritional powerhouse we believe it is? And, even if it is, is it possible to get too much of a good thing? As someone who personally LOVES &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a27059031/instant-pot-yogurt-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:yogurt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt; (and eats it very often), I take these questions very seriously, so I took a deep dive into the topic, consulting two nutritionists and reading countless articles. Here’s everything you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Let’s talk about that STUNNING nutritional resume:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no denying it: yogurt brings some amazing health benefits. According to registered dietitian &lt;a href="http://www.jessicacordingnutrition.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Cording;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jessica Cording&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, dairy-based yogurt is a great source of calcium, vitamin B-12, riboflavin, potassium, and phosphorus. It also has a lot of protein (depending on the type and brand, a 5.3-ounce serving can contain up to &lt;a href="https://usa.fage/products/yogurt/fage-total-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:16 grams;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;16 grams&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!) and, since most dairy in the United States is fortified with vitamin D, it’s a good source of that as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many types of yogurt also contain probiotics, aka beneficial bacteria, which, according to registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://crossfit26.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kim Yawitz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kim Yawitz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “help optimize the balance between good and bad microorganisms in your gut.” Yawitz shares that eating probiotic-rich yogurt can potentially help to “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-025-93603-3&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.delish.com%2Ffood%2Fa64144233%2Fis-it-healthy-to-eat-yogurt-every-day-experts-weigh-in%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fend off intestinal infections;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;fend off intestinal infections&lt;/a&gt;, relieve symptoms of &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1494118/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:irritable bowel syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/regular-yogurt-consumption-may-reduce-colon-cancer-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduce the risk of colon cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reduce the risk of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;.” Between the gut health benefits, all those vitamins and minerals, and the boost of protein, it might seem like eating a cup of yogurt every morning is a win-win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;However... (let’s not get carried away!)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all yogurt is created equal. While yogurt can have great health benefits, its specific nutritional value vastly varies depending on what yogurt you’re consuming. For example, only some types of yogurt carry the live probiotics that are so good for the gut. Yawitz shares that most naturally-occurring probiotics in yogurt actually die when the yogurt is pasteurized, so the only types of yogurt that still contain them are those where the manufacturers have actually added the bacteria back into the yogurt after it was pasteurized. These refortified yogurts are set up to benefit our gut health; anything that doesn’t tout “live probiotics” on the packaging won’t do your gut any good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, a specific yogurt’s nutritional value can vary wildly depending on the amount of added sugar. According to Yawitz, a “seemingly innocent fruit-flavored yogurt” can contain “just as much added sugar as a serving of ice cream.” Don’t believe it? Check out the nutrition facts for this popular brand’s &lt;a href="https://www.yoplait.com/products/original-single-serve-strawberry" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:6-ounce container of strawberry yogurt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;6-ounce container of strawberry yogurt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: it contains only 5 grams protein and a whopping 18 grams sugar. For comparison, a serving of this brand’s &lt;a href="https://smartlabel.unileverusa.com/077567226006-0001-en-US/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vanilla ice cream;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;vanilla ice cream&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also contains (you guessed it!) 18 grams sugar. I don’t know about you, but given the option, I’d probably take the ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly yogurt has the potential to be a great healthy option on any (and every) weekday morning, but it’s not necessarily a given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what do you buy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few good rules of thumb to follow when choosing your morning “cuppa yo’.” Here’s what to look for, whether you’re cruising the dairy aisle or snagging a container at your local coffee shop:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go high-protein.&lt;/strong&gt; Maximizing yogurt’s high-protein potential is especially important if you’re hoping to sustain your energy until lunch. Cording often recommends Greek or Icelandic-style yogurt since these varieties are both “higher in protein and will help you feel full for longer.” But she does note that these high-protein yogurts aren’t everyone’s favorite, and that if you prefers the texture of plain, non-Greek-style yogurt, you shouldn’t feel obligated to opt for it for the sake of a little extra protein. Instead, she recommends incorporating a little extra protein from other sources into that morning meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid the added sugars. &lt;/strong&gt;Unless you actually want dessert for breakfast (and there’s definitely a time and place for that!), follow Cording’s recommendation and opt for “unflavored” over flavored (i.e. sweetened) yogurts. But if you really hate plain yogurt, don’t despair: Cording recommends looking for lower-sugar options or ones that use “natural sugar alternatives like allulose, monk fruit, and stevia.” She also suggests plain and flavored yogurt together and gradually adjusting the ratios over time so “your tastebuds adjust.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep it cultured.&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure you’re actually getting all the probiotic benefits by checking the labels ensure your yogurt has been refortified with those bacteria. Yawitz recommends looking for products with the words “live and active cultures” on the label and specific strains of bacteria in the ingredients list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yogurt has the potential to be a highly healthy addition to your diet, but it’s absolutely not a given. Double check the label on your carton next time to make sure you’re doubling down on the full benefits of your morning cup of yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 20:57:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5IVE9fWjAybi1JUG9sQkxDTEZsUXhFYUUzVHBXVHo5Z0lCS09jYVpJNmxld3VpWlcyVUZnR2tVMWt5RDBvemc2WEo5ZWlUdjRMYVhrektMRGdLX3ljVkJOQ2xNS200c2hrSXhDRjR0bDE</guid></item><item><title>‘Clean your plate’ leads to problems; doctor offers ways to encourage healthy eating in kids - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxNVE5wSW5sN2JZLUtrQzA0RHU4YzkyOVlCT19tZm04dWJ1RVhVOFh6LWNMb25oWGJzR3oySlJSSGl4cVoxSXdGQzhLOWdUVGlJTkt4aGhBbGxfdjEzamNHRV94ZjhuVG1tbUVQNHYxdEFEd092VlVNZG9UMUdOcC1pQklyMDF3eVpjR19hb0RRMVo1ZHZiRDZYUUU4MFJTWWFEcmh0QzE5bllGb1JzUUJ5Yk02MXRhSFhxc0o3dVIyeV9McXBzNHV4QVNR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;One local doctor offers is offering ways to encourage healthy eating in kids as food rules could lead to overeating, food anxiety or eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;For generations, well-meaning parents have resorted to an arsenal of food rules, including “clean your plate before you leave the table,” to try to get their children to eat a well-balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My parents said the same thing to me,” said &lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/providers/michelearthurs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Michele Arthurs&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine physician with Kaiser Permanente in Temple Hills, Maryland. “When we’re looking at the overall relationship with food, we want to rethink that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forcing children to finish their food can teach them to ignore natural hunger and fullness signals that are built-in for humans. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over time, this can contribute to overeating, and food anxiety, and sometimes even eating disorders,” said Arthurs. “It’s important for our kids to learn how to stop eating when they feel satisfied, not when they feel too full.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, March is &lt;a href="https://www.eatright.org/about-national-nutrition-month" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National Nutrition Month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making healthy food available at the dinner table is a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s important for our children to be exposed to all the food groups — different vegetables, different fruits, different whole grains, different sources of protein,” said Arthurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having a little bit of a trial on the plate can be helpful — invite that,” she suggested. “It doesn’t have to always be accepted by our child. We might have to try 30 times before the new food, no matter what color it is, is indeed sampled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the problem with food rules?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a parent insists a child eat their food, “it can create a relationship with food that feels antagonistic,” Arthurs said. “The child does not have control over that particular situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, she said the goal is to empower young eaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When it comes to their own choices for food, that they have control over that. That they understand the purpose of food — that’s it’s more than just how it tastes, that it’s there to nourish their body,” Arthurs said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects can be long-lasting. A child who is forced to eat vegetables is likely to become an adult who doesn’t want to eat vegetables, and “that’s a hard habit to undo,” said Arthurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empower children at the grocery store&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than imposing edicts at the dinner table, Arthurs said there are easy ways to help children develop a healthy relationship with food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If they’re coming with us to the grocery store, we can play ‘Where’s Waldo’ with food,” she suggests. As an example: “I’m looking for a food that’s red, that’s sweet, that has tiny little seeds on the side, and is high in all these wonderful vitamins and nutrients that we need — what might that be?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The answer, by the way, is “strawberries.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another idea is to look for ways to remind children about the benefits of healthy eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of kids say, ‘I want to grow up to be big and strong.’ And you can answer, ‘What are the foods on your plate that are going to support that?'” said Arthurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0"&gt;Leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered staff this week not to release their experts’ assessment that found the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0"&gt;In an aborted plan to roll out the news, the agency would have emphasized the importance of vaccinating people against the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease that has spread to 19 states, the records show.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0"&gt;A CDC spokesperson told ProPublica in a written statement that the agency decided against releasing the assessment “because it does not say anything that the public doesn’t already know.” She added that the CDC continues to recommend vaccines as “the best way to protect against measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0"&gt;But what the nation’s top public health agency said next shows a shift in its long-standing messaging about vaccines, a sign that it may be falling in line under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines:&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0"&gt;“The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” the statement said, echoing a line from a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;column Kennedy wrote&lt;/a&gt; for the Fox News website. “People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0"&gt;ProPublica shared the new CDC statement about personal choice and risk with Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. To her, the shift in messaging, and the squelching of this routine announcement, is alarming.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0"&gt;“I’m a bit stunned by that language,” Nuzzo said. “No vaccine is without risk, but that makes it sound like it’s a very active coin toss of a decision. We’ve already had more cases of measles in 2025 than we had in 2024, and it’s spread to multiple states. It is not a coin toss at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0"&gt;For many years, the CDC hasn’t minced words on vaccines. It &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html"&gt;promoted them with confidence&lt;/a&gt;. One campaign was called “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/ad-council-flu-campaign.htm"&gt;Get My Flu Shot&lt;/a&gt;.” The agency’s website &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/hcp/conversation-tips/index.html"&gt;told medical providers&lt;/a&gt; they play a critical role in helping parents choose vaccines for their children: “Instead of saying ‘What do you want to do about shots?,’ say ‘Your child needs three shots today.’”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0"&gt;Nuzzo wishes the CDC’s forecasters would put out more details of their data and evidence on the spread of measles, not less. “The growing scale and severity of this measles outbreak and the urgent need for more data to guide the response underscores why we need a fully staffed and functional CDC and more resources for state and local health departments,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0"&gt;Kennedy’s agency oversees the CDC and on Thursday announced it was poised to eliminate 2,400 jobs there.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0"&gt;When asked what role, if any, Kennedy played in the decision to not release the risk assessment, HHS’ communications director said the aborted announcement “was part of an ongoing process to improve communication processes — nothing more, nothing less.” The CDC, he reiterated, continues to recommend vaccination “as the best way to protect against measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0"&gt;“Secretary Kennedy believes that the decision to vaccinate is a personal one and that people should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine,” Andrew G. Nixon said. “It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal healthcare decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0"&gt;Responding to questions about criticism of the decision among some CDC staff, Nixon wrote, “Some individuals at the CDC seem more interested in protecting their own status or agenda rather than aligning with this Administration and the true mission of public health.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0"&gt;The CDC’s risk assessment was carried out by its Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which relied, in part, on new disease data from the outbreak in Texas. The CDC created the center to address a major shortcoming laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic. It functions like a National Weather Service for infectious diseases, harnessing data and expertise to predict the course of outbreaks like a meteorologist warns of storms.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0"&gt;Other risk assessments by the center have been posted by the CDC even though their conclusions might seem obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0"&gt;In late February, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/h5-risk-assessment.html"&gt;forecasters analyzing the spread of H5N1&lt;/a&gt; bird flu said people who come “in contact with potentially infected animals or contaminated surfaces or fluids” faced a moderate to high risk of contracting the disease. The risk to the general U.S. population, they said, was low.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0"&gt;In the case of the measles assessment, modelers at the center determined the risk of the disease for the general public in the U.S. is low, but they found the risk is high in communities with low vaccination rates that are near outbreaks or share close social ties to those areas with outbreaks. The CDC had moderate confidence in the assessment, according to an internal Q&amp;amp;A that explained the findings. The agency, it said, lacks detailed data about the onset of the illness for all patients in West Texas and is still learning about the vaccination rates in affected communities as well as travel and social contact among those infected. (The H5N1 assessment was also made with moderate confidence.)&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0"&gt;The internal plan to roll out the news of the forecast called for the expert physician who’s leading the CDC’s response to measles to be the chief spokesperson answering questions. “It is important to note that at local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist even in areas with high vaccination coverage overall,” the plan said. “The best way to protect against measles is to get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0"&gt;This week, though, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 483, more than 30 agency staff were told in an email that after a discussion in the CDC director’s office, “leadership does not want to pursue putting this on the website.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0"&gt;The cancellation was “not normal at all,” said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal with layoffs looming. “I’ve never seen a rollout plan that was canceled at that far along in the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0"&gt;Anxiety among CDC staff has been building over whether the agency will bend its public health messages to match those of Kennedy, a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine group and referred clients to a law firm suing a vaccine manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0"&gt;During Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS halted the CDC campaign that encouraged people to get flu shots during a ferocious flu season. On the night that the Trump administration began firing probationary employees across the federal government, some key CDC flu webpages were taken down. Remnants of some of the campaign webpages were restored after &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated"&gt;NPR reported&lt;/a&gt; this.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0"&gt;But some at the agency felt like the new leadership had sent a message loud and clear: When next to nobody was paying attention, long-standing public health messages could be silenced.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0"&gt;On the day in February that the world learned that an unvaccinated &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/R8XT-4XUB"&gt;child had died&lt;/a&gt; of measles in Texas, the first such death in the U.S. since 2015, the HHS secretary &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/"&gt;downplayed the seriousness&lt;/a&gt; of the outbreak. “We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0"&gt;In an interview on Fox News this month, Kennedy championed doctors in Texas who he said were treating measles with a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, a supplement that is high in vitamin A. “They’re seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0"&gt;As parents near the outbreak in Texas stocked up on vitamin A supplements, doctors there raced to assure parents that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doctors-push-back-parents-embrace-kennedy-vitamin-texas-measles-outbreak-2025-03-08/"&gt;only vaccination, not the vitamin, can prevent measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0"&gt;Still, the CDC added &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;an entry on Vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; to its measles website for clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0"&gt;On Wednesday, CNN reported that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/texas-measles-vitamin-a-toxicity/index.html"&gt;several hospitalized children in Lubbock, Texas, had abnormal liver function&lt;/a&gt;, a likely sign of toxicity from too much vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0"&gt;Texas health officials also said that the Trump administration’s decision to rescind $11 billion in pandemic-related grants across the country &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/26/texas-measles-public-health-funding-cut/"&gt;will hinder their ability to respond&lt;/a&gt; to the growing outbreak, according to The Texas Tribune.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0"&gt;Measles is among the most contagious diseases and can be dangerous. About 20% of unvaccinated people who get measles wind up in the hospital. And &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children&lt;/a&gt; with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. The virus can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html"&gt;linger in the air&lt;/a&gt; for two hours after an infected person has left an area, and patients can spread measles before they even know they have it.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0"&gt;This week Amtrak said it was notifying customers that they may have been exposed to the disease this month when a passenger with measles &lt;a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/amtrak-confirms-passenger-measles-traveled-new-york-washington-dc/16085440/"&gt;rode one of its trains&lt;/a&gt; from New York City to Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
        
    &lt;/div&gt;

Forty-one patients have been hospitalized, and a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/anti-vaccine-influencers-weaponized-measles-death-texas-rcna196900" target="_blank"&gt;6-year-old child has died&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;All but two of Texas' confirmed infections have been in people who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The outbreak has spread to three other states: New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas, where the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON561" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization reported on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that a DNA sequence of the virus in one case was identical to those from Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The outbreak originated in Gaines County, Texas, which has recorded 226 cases, according to the state health department. The county has one of the state’s highest school vaccine exemption rates at nearly 18%, according to&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions" target="_blank"&gt; health department data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Katherine Wells, director of public health for nearby Lubbock County, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/-worried-getting-worse-texas-measles-outbreak-grows-families-resist-va-rcna196873" target="_blank"&gt;told NBC News last week&lt;/a&gt; that efforts to increase vaccination there have gotten a lukewarm response and suggested that it could be a year until the outbreak is controlled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Nationally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 92.7% of kindergarteners have had two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The two-shot regimen is &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-texas-rfk-jr-response-vaccines-doctors-wary-rcna194510" target="_blank"&gt;97% effective at preventing measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-vaccination-rates-may-lower-thought-risking-us-elimination-sta-rcna198259" target="_blank"&gt;rate may be lower&lt;/a&gt; among children younger than 5, who are not fully captured in surveillance data. A &lt;a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/epdf/10.2105/AJPH.2024.307912" target="_blank"&gt;study last month&lt;/a&gt; calculated, based on a survey, that the share could be as low as 72%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In large part thanks to the success of the MMR vaccine, measles has been considered eliminated in the U.S. since 2000, meaning the virus is not continuously spreading, though there are occasional outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-texas-measles-mn-1030-810564.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-texas-measles-mn-1030-810564.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-texas-measles-mn-1030-810564.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-texas-measles-mn-1030-810564.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-texas-measles-mn-1030-810564.jpg" alt="One Death Reported As Texas Measles Outbreak Spreads"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Ambra Hawksley holds her son, Andrik, 6, while his sister, JaeLynn, holds his hand as he prepares to get an MMR vaccine at a clinic in Lubbock, Texas, on March 1. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Jan Sonnenmair / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Infants usually get their first measles shot at 12 to 15 months, followed by the second when they are 4 to 6 years old.

It also has a lot of protein (depending on the type and brand, a 5.3-ounce serving can contain up to &lt;a href="https://usa.fage/products/yogurt/fage-total-0" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://usa.fage/products/yogurt/fage-total-0" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="16 grams" data-node-id="4.3" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="4.3.0"&gt;16 grams&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!) and, since most dairy in the United States is fortified with vitamin D, it’s a good source of that as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Many types of yogurt also contain probiotics, aka beneficial bacteria, which, according to registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://crossfit26.com" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://crossfit26.com" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kim Yawitz" data-node-id="6.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="6.1.0"&gt;Kim Yawitz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “help optimize the balance between good and bad microorganisms in your gut.” Yawitz shares that eating probiotic-rich yogurt can potentially help to “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1525073&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-025-93603-3" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-93603-3" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="fend off intestinal infections" data-vars-ga-product-id="e1347d59-1fca-4683-b336-cff775d30c3b" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="6.3" data-href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-93603-3" data-product-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-93603-3" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1525073&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-025-93603-3" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/tLTZ/nature-placeholder","site_id":"0ab1c860-336a-4b0b-bb94-dd080aea7a20","network":{"name":"Skimlinks"}}' data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="15e02e83-46e8-4ebf-8ed7-8f9a471aa20b" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-1i7jlb0 e1aq0z090"&gt;fend off intestinal infections&lt;/a&gt;, relieve symptoms of &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1494118/full" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1494118/full" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="irritable bowel syndrome" data-node-id="6.5" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/regular-yogurt-consumption-may-reduce-colon-cancer-risk/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/regular-yogurt-consumption-may-reduce-colon-cancer-risk/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reduce the risk of colon cancer" data-node-id="6.7" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;reduce the risk of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;.” Between the gut health benefits, all those vitamins and minerals, and the boost of protein, it might seem like eating a cup of yogurt every morning is a win-win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="however----lets-not-get-carried-away" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-1iyazm5 emevuu60"&gt;However . . . (let’s not get carried away!)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Not all yogurt is created equal. While yogurt can have great health benefits, its specific nutritional value vastly varies depending on what yogurt you’re consuming. For example, only some types of yogurt carry the live probiotics that are so good for the gut. Yawitz shares that most naturally-occurring probiotics in yogurt actually die when the yogurt is pasteurized, so the only types of yogurt that still contain them are those where the manufacturers have actually added the bacteria back into the yogurt after it was pasteurized. These refortified yogurts are set up to benefit our gut health; anything that doesn’t tout “live probiotics” on the packaging won’t do your gut any good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In addition, a specific yogurt’s nutritional value can vary wildly depending on the amount of added sugar. According to Yawitz, a “seemingly innocent fruit-flavored yogurt” can contain “just as much added sugar as a serving of ice cream.” Don’t believe it? Check out the nutrition facts for this popular brand’s &lt;a href="https://www.yoplait.com/products/original-single-serve-strawberry" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.yoplait.com/products/original-single-serve-strawberry" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="6-ounce container of strawberry yogurt" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="10.1.0"&gt;6-ounce container of strawberry yogurt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: it contains only 5 grams protein and a whopping 18 grams sugar. For comparison, a serving of this brand’s &lt;a href="https://smartlabel.unileverusa.com/077567226006-0001-en-US/index.html" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://smartlabel.unileverusa.com/077567226006-0001-en-US/index.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="vanilla ice cream" data-node-id="10.3" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="10.3.0"&gt;vanilla ice cream&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also contains (you guessed it!) 18 grams sugar. I don’t know about you, but given the option, I’d probably take the ice cream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Clearly yogurt has the potential to be a great healthy option on any (and every) weekday morning, but it’s not necessarily a given. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="so-what-do-you-buy" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1iyazm5 emevuu60"&gt;So what do you buy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;There are a few good rules of thumb to follow when choosing your morning “cuppa yo’.” Here’s what to look for, whether you’re cruising the dairy aisle or snagging a container at your local coffee shop:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;Go high-protein.&lt;/strong&gt; Maximizing yogurt’s high-protein potential is especially important if you’re hoping to sustain your energy until lunch. Cording often recommends Greek or Icelandic-style yogurt since these varieties are both “higher in protein and will help you feel full for longer.” But she does note that these high-protein yogurts aren’t everyone’s favorite, and that if you prefers the texture of plain, non-Greek-style yogurt, you shouldn’t feel obligated to opt for it for the sake of a little extra protein. Instead, she recommends incorporating a little extra protein from other sources into that morning meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;Avoid the added sugars. &lt;/strong&gt;Unless you actually want dessert for breakfast (and there’s definitely a time and place for that!), follow Cording’s recommendation and opt for “unflavored” over flavored (i.e. sweetened) yogurts. But if you really hate plain yogurt, don’t despair: Cording recommends looking for lower-sugar options or ones that use “natural sugar alternatives like allulose, monk fruit, and stevia.” She also suggests plain and flavored yogurt together and gradually adjusting the ratios over time so “your tastebuds adjust.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Keep it cultured.&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure you’re actually getting all the probiotic benefits by checking the labels ensure your yogurt has been refortified with those bacteria. Yawitz recommends looking for products with the words “live and active cultures” on the label and specific strains of bacteria in the ingredients list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Yogurt has the potential to be a highly healthy addition to your diet, but it’s absolutely not a given. Double check the label on your carton next time to make sure you’re doubling down on the full benefits of your morning cup of yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/37b1c6a7-d6d1-4464-8eaf-a6e9b24393a1_1737744884.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Taylor Ann Spencer" title="Headshot of Taylor Ann Spencer" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;div class="css-10lfdfh ev8dhu54"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As food editor at Delish, Taylor Ann has tested and developed dozens of recipes, styled numerous photo &amp;amp; video shoots, and writes feature stories specializing in health, food science, and safety.

Carefully crafted from shaded green tea leaves, the tea is renowned for its rich flavor, smooth texture and culinary versatility, from overnight oats to cake and even jello shots. Along with its alluring sensory appeal, matcha green tea contains several key compounds that contribute to a wide range of health benefits. Below you will discover the health benefits of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-matcha-powders-8702967" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;matcha powder&lt;/a&gt; and exciting ways to enjoy this robust—and often refreshing—beverage.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Starting your day with a mug of matcha may promote a sense of calm and clarity. Matcha contains an amino acid called &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/l-theanine-benefits-8662995" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;L-theanine&lt;/a&gt;, which has been found to boost alpha waves in the brain, leading to increased feelings of relaxation and calmness, says &lt;a href="https://upliftfitnutrition.com/about-lacey-dunn/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lacey Dunn, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a functional medicine dietitian and owner of Uplift Fit Nutrition.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; L-theanine also increases the production of several neurotransmitters in the brain, such as serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which help to reduce stress and anxiety, she adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Enhance Your Brain Function &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with being an excellent source of L-theanine, matcha also contains a small &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009784/how-much-caffeine-is-too-much/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;amount of caffeine&lt;/a&gt;. Together, L-theanine and caffeine can increase memory and mental alertness, says Dunn.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In that way, you get the best of both worlds. “L-theanine may help to avoid the jittery and anxious feeling that comes with caffeine consumption, as well as promote a feeling of relaxation,” she says.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Matcha may also aid in reducing oxidative stress, which can damage neurons in the brain and is linked to cognitive decline and memory impairment, says Dunn.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “It’s believed that the EGCG and caffeine content in matcha may help to alleviate this and reduce neuroinflammation,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Reduce Your Risk of Cancer &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Making matcha a regular part of your daily routine may also aid in the prevention of certain cancers. “Matcha may help reduce cancer risk by halting the growth of cancer cells and reducing oxidative stress, which increases the risk of DNA damage and tumor formation,” says Dunn. The anti-cancer effects of matcha are attributed to a powerful catechin called epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, matcha is just one part of your diet. More clinical research is needed to confirm these findings and understand its full potential in cancer prevention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Improve Your Heart Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The compounds in matcha may also tone up your ticker. More specifically, the catechins in matcha have strong antioxidant properties that help to lower inflammation associated with cardiovascular disease, says&lt;a href="https://jejenoval.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; JeJe Noval, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, an integrative and functional registered dietitian specializing in digestive and hormone health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Matcha may also help to lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases and improve heart health through its ability to increase insulin sensitivity, reduce total and LDL (bad) cholesterol and reduce triglycerides,” says Dunn. She adds that matcha may even have a small but beneficial effect on high blood pressure by boosting antioxidant enzymes that protect blood vessel walls from damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regularly sipping on matcha tea may be good for your gut. The EGCG in matcha can help support gut health by counteracting harmful bacteria and promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut, says Dunn.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For that reason, matcha may be a good addition to your diet in cases of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291572/what-to-eat-if-you-have-ibs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and &lt;em&gt;H. pylori&lt;/em&gt; infections, she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Help Manage Your Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Matcha may help lower blood glucose levels through its ability to improve &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Think of insulin like a key, allowing glucose to enter your cells to be used, versus floating freely in the blood,” says Dunn. “When your cells are more sensitive to insulin, your body is better able to use glucose as fuel versus storing it as body fat,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The compound in matcha that is believed to regulate insulin secretion and enhance insulin sensitivity is a plant pigment called quercetin. This compound may support carbohydrate metabolism, says Noval, which may be one tool to help manage healthy blood glucose levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Matcha’s rich EGCG and caffeine content may help slightly increase your metabolism and ability to burn fat through a process called thermogenesis, says Dunn. “This increased thermogenesis helps your body to produce more heat, which increases the calories you burn at rest,” Dunn explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This effect is likely to be small (and more research is needed), but matcha may play a role in your overall diet if you’re aiming to lose weight.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Matcha is a low-calorie beverage with very few vitamins and minerals. However, it is a significant source of bioactive compounds, including L-theanine, quercetin, catechins, caffeine and chlorophyll, which are responsible for matcha’s various health benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though matcha is typically safe to consume and well-tolerated by most people, its caffeine content may cause side effects in some individuals. “It may induce anxiety, irritability, insomnia or headaches in those sensitive to caffeine,” says Dunn.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, high doses of matcha may affect liver enzyme function and detoxification pathways in the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (This is most likely to occur from taking high doses of green tea supplements.) As a result, Dunn warns that this can interact with some medications. Therefore, if you have preexisting health conditions and are taking medications, speak with your health care provider to ensure matcha is safe for you to consume.

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matcha is a green tea powder that is made from the leaves of the &lt;em&gt;Camellia sinensis &lt;/em&gt;plant.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What sets it apart from other green tea varieties is its unique cultivation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the growth period, the green tea bushes are covered with bamboo to shade the delicate leaves from direct sunlight. This method of sun protection prompts the tea leaves to produce higher amounts of beneficial compounds, including chlorophyll and L-theanine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These potent plant compounds give matcha its distinctive dark green pigment and robust flavor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the leaves have fully matured, they are carefully harvested and lightly steamed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The leaves are then ground into a fine powder to make matcha tea. Unlike steeping traditional &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-green-teas-8606079" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;green tea&lt;/a&gt;, matcha involves consuming the entire leaf, offering a more concentrated source of its many health-enhancing compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is OK and beneficial to drink matcha regularly. Matcha is a great beverage to consume in the morning, as it contains L-theanine and caffeine. The L-theanine, in particular, helps to offset the jittery feeling associated with caffeine consumption while promoting a sense of calm and mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed to confirm matcha’s effects on weight loss, it may help increase your metabolism and ability to burn fat through a process called thermogenesis. However, matcha is not a magic bullet for weight loss and should be combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_5-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although matcha is safe to consume for most people, its caffeine content may cause several side effects, including headaches, anxiety, irritability and insomnia in those who are sensitive. Additionally, high doses of matcha may negatively influence liver enzyme function and the metabolism of certain medications. Therefore, it may be helpful to talk to your health care provider before making matcha a regular part of your dietary regimen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether enjoyed in a cozy coffee shop or the comfort of your home, matcha contains several key compounds that make it ideal to add to your routine. From L-theanine to EGCG, matcha offers potential benefits for brain, gut and heart health and may aid in weight management and improve your blood glucose levels. If you have existing health concerns, be sure to consult with your health care provider before incorporating it into your daily routine.&lt;br&gt;

Longevity is one of three "transformational innovation opportunities" that will drive equity markets in the next decade, a team of strategists said in a note Wednesday. The other two are artificial intelligence and power and resources. "The combination of ever-increasing lifespans and a demographic shift toward an older population creates a range of investment opportunities," the UBS strategists wrote. One area that is already established in the space is retirement living, which is growing at a 4% compound annual growth rate until 2030, they said. The oldest baby boomers are rapidly approaching their 80th birthday and that is going to increase demand for senior housing options, such as independent living, assisted living and nursing homes. The National Investment Center for Seniors Housing &amp;amp; Care predicts that 200,000 additional senior housing units will be needed in 2025, an additional 500,000 units by 2028 and another 775,000 units by 2030. Senior housing stocks UBS sees two real estate investment trusts that will benefit from the trend, and they pay solid dividends. Ventas , whose portfolio includes senior housing communities, skilled nursing facilities and medical office buildings, has a 2.8% dividend yield. Analyst Jonathan Woloshin likes the diversity in its real estate holdings and geographic locations. Ventas has 1,400 properties across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. VTR YTD mountain Ventas The ongoing recovery in senior housing, which took a hit during the Covid pandemic, has led to an uptick in Ventas' senior housing occupancy levels, he pointed out. New senior housing supply is now at its lowest level since the first quarter of 2013, he noted. "The increase in occupancy is leading to stronger pricing power and margin improvement," Woloshin said. In addition, the inconsistent management execution seen in recent quarters has abated and ventas' shares are closing the valuation gap with the company's largest peer, he added. Shares are up about 16% year to date. Welltower also has a diversified portfolio. The company boasts more than 1,500 senior housing, post-acute communities and outpatient medical properties in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. It pays a dividend yield of about 1.8%. "WELL has a strong senior housing portfolio located in a number of high-barrier-to-entry markets, something that continues to benefit the company in a post- COVID-19 world," UBS analyst Thomas Parmentier wrote. "In addition, senior housing occupancy gains have bolstered WELL's stock price." WELL YTD mountain Welltower The stock, which is up 21% so far this year, is trading at a "significant premium valuation" to its peers, he pointed out. However, he thinks a premium is justified given Welltower's strong operational performance and growth. "WELL is in solid financial shape, in our view, with an investment-grade balance sheet, a good management team, manageable debt maturities, and solid access to liquidity," Parmentier said. "We believe the dividend is safe and could increase should operating results continue to improve." Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange! Uncertain markets?

It staged the trial in conjunction with six NHS hospitals in England and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Shiva Tripathi, an NHS pain consultant and the chief investigator of the trial, said if the drug is approved by regulators and becomes available it would be “a gamechanger for chronic lower back pain on the similar levels as [how] antibiotics made a difference to infection. Because if we can get these 25% of the patients with chronic low back pain back to work, back to no medications, back to no more disability, then I think [that] will be the massive gamechanger for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, the randomised controlled trial involved only 44 patients – 22 in Britain and 22 in Spain, Denmark and New Zealand – so PP353 will have to undergo further trials, and be endorsed by the medicines watchdogs, before doctors can offer it to patients to relieve their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The patients had all had severe back pain for at least six months, and in some cases more than five years, that had not responded to conventional treatment, such as painkilling medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Persica said that a big advantage of their treatment is that the patient has two injections four days apart rather than undergoing surgery or taking tablets for a long time. Recent &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/18/only-10-of-non-surgical-treatments-for-back-problems-kill-pain-says-review" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research found&lt;/a&gt; that most of the 56 ways of trying to alleviate back pain which researchers studied – ranging from massage and acupuncture to painkillers and physiotherapy – brought little or no real relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;PP353 is a combination of three substances that are already widely used in medicine: linezolid, an antibiotic; iohexol, a contrast agent or dye; and a thermosensitive gel. It is injected into the lower back in order to banish an infection that has developed around the discs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Steve Ruston, the firm’s chief executive, said: “Our first patient trial produced really positive results. [It produced] significant reductions in pain and disability and [patients also got] clinically meaningful benefit and statistically significant benefit. The patient benefit potential is enormous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“If you can reduce the pain and disability that people are living with in the way that some of our [trial] patients have responded, it will transform their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Market research shows that 2 million people in the US and 250,000-300,000 in the UK could benefit, he added. “Millions of people around the world can benefit from this. But low back pain is not just a first-world problem; everybody gets low back pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The drug is different from other back pain treatments, Ruston added, because it targets the underlying cause of the problem rather than just its main symptom – pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/low-back-pain" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Low back pain&lt;/a&gt; is one of the world’s commonest health problems. Six in 10 people in the UK develop it at some point. It is expected to grow as a problem worldwide because of the ageing and growing population. It is often hard to diagnose the cause and even harder to treat successfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Many patients in the trial experienced a drop in the amount of pain they were suffering within a month of the injections and were still feeling a lot better after a year, Persica said. However, it reduced, but did not remove, the need to keep taking painkillers, Ruston added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But Dr Benjamin Ellis, a consultant rheumatologist at Imperial Healthcare NHS trust in London, who specialises in chronic pain, voiced scepticism about PP353’s potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Modern medicine has largely failed people with chronic – in other words, long-term – back pain. But there is little evidence that interventions using surgery or injections, or even taking medicines, makes much difference for the vast majority of people with chronic low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“People with chronic low back pain are understandably desperate for anything that can help. There’s also a huge industry in supplying technologies and medicines that claim to help, but little evidence that these do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Promising holistic approaches, such as cognitive functional therapy, often don’t get a look in, particularly when services are overstretched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“That being said, if there is a subgroup of people with chronic low back pain that can reliably and safely benefit from a simple pair of injections, then that would be fantastic news – but it seems unlikely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 18:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQTzlldDZ2MHBrU2h1V0dUMUFxV2hBV2t5MXhlQkF3dGF2cllyOWVqUTNxYW11dWdodktZcGxUTnFmQTliUmZabmh2a0NGYmpvN0pkWngtOFFsZnBTZDNBYjU1eHJpekFBWEJRTmlaYU9kSXNHWFJIRjFKak1QV0piQ2x2cGk2R3k2Z1QxN19jSFVTV29pc0ZBWHlSeU9PeGI4</guid></item><item><title>Texas hospital treating children with vitamin A toxicity: Reports - NewsNation Now</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxOTE42YnowUUo2Ui1jZHBqcHpBZDVQREo4TW1tUGgyNWhRTFMxYTZCcS0tbXpjUER1VVpMZjZHclpFb2hzajFsTlRUNHVxZXRJeWNPTFJCcGptZWhkeHpNV3I3VUJfRGluS1JUSmJ0Nzl2VlpBQkhwZkhiMURKMVlBNEhEYmRqbTR1WmZIS0VGYVpEaTB30gGaAUFVX3lxTFBWM0xUWE1EVVpqY0FpVGk3THhXeG02Q3ZiLWZ4TTBpalV0OHd3S1Jra1BHRVRSRERFUzU1LVhGbU5uRVhHZmxhZTRNMXlSaFZ4bVFGVDJ4OGZjaW1NNkVhWHZhYnMtM2hxR19lWm1vRmJoaW5lUFcyYnUzeDhha3YzQU1DS1lRWS0zRHJlUE9zRmtOeWU2a1c2WkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t2f91a004tvrm01n4s93zr@published"&gt;Tuberculosis has been crawling its way back into the spotlight. In 2020, after a &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/us-tuberculosis-tb-rates-rising"&gt;three-decade decline&lt;/a&gt;, TB cases in the U.S. began climbing again. Last year, that number &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/tuberculosis-tb-infection-cdc-d1165566b838bd8a838975e4e5e13b79"&gt;was at its highest since 2011&lt;/a&gt;. There has been a &lt;a href="https://www.kumc.edu/about/news/news-archive/tuberculosis-outbreak-in-kansas.html"&gt;TB outbreak in Kansas&lt;/a&gt; since January 2024, with over 100 people infected and two deaths. Recent data show that Europe saw a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-calls-immediate-action-report-shows-10-rise-child-tb-infections-european-2025-03-24/"&gt;10 percent rise in childhood infections&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, with more than 7,500 cases. What with &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-tb-day"&gt;World Tuberculosis Day&lt;/a&gt; this week, and the release of John Green’s new book &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/03/john-green-tuberculosis-book-fault-in-our-stars.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything Is Tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week, TB, which is often thought of as an old-timey disease, might seem to suddenly be a concern once again.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabw001w3b72hcriri8h@published"&gt;In reality, though, tuberculosis never went away. It regularly kills over a million people a year and infects millions more. It is literally the world’s &lt;em&gt;deadliest infectious disease&lt;/em&gt;—yes, you read that right. It was bumped out of first place by COVID-19 for a while, but it returned to the top last year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabw001x3b72k4wp4hod@published"&gt;We don’t hear much about TB in the U.S. because it’s largely under control here, but it’s a huge threat in other regions, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2023/tb-disease-burden/1-1-tb-incidence"&gt;Southeast Asia and Africa&lt;/a&gt;. There are treatments for TB. And yet, the federal government’s &lt;a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1160826"&gt;recent cuts to foreign aid&lt;/a&gt; mean that many people across the world will no longer be able to access treatment (on top of all the people who already lacked access to treatment). “We can cure virtually everyone with tuberculosis,” says William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “We have the capacity to do that.” As Slate’s Tony Ho Tran wrote eloquently in a piece about &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/03/john-green-tuberculosis-book-fault-in-our-stars.html"&gt;Green’s new book&lt;/a&gt;: “It’s a decision to let people die.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabw001y3b72sv68pd1m@published"&gt;That decision also increases the risk for Americans, most of whom have long been lucky enough to not have to think about TB. Let’s talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="10" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabw001z3b72y1ihguzc@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;cases rising in the U.S. right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="119" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabw00203b72k5yu573n@published"&gt;Any time there’s turbulence in the world, the risk of transmission increases. That’s true of most diseases, but especially for TB, which requires long courses of treatment to work. Whether due to armed conflicts, refugee migration, or a global pandemic, “if populations are in turmoil, public health breaks down,” says Schaffner. “And tuberculosis control programs come to a screeching halt.” That’s what happened in 2020, when COVID brought the world, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10381217/"&gt;TB control programs&lt;/a&gt;, to a stop. When those initiatives stall, infected individuals can’t receive their treatment, and they can’t be monitored and supported while receiving their treatment. That leads to more transmission, which means more infections—which increases risk even in places where the disease has been under control.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="9" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabw00213b72ca63f3bh@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m realizing I don’t even know what tuberculosis &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabx00223b72i0m775m6@published"&gt;Fair enough! It shows up in movies and books as old-fashioned and romantic—think poets wasting away by the seaside of “consumption” (TB’s historical nickname). The wasting-away part is true: “For the most part, TB is a &lt;em&gt;smoldering&lt;/em&gt; disease,” says Schaffner. It kills slowly. But it’s definitely not romantic.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabx00233b72rfn46kgj@published"&gt;Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria that, after infecting a person, tend to hibernate in the body. It can stay there for five, 10, 20 years, without causing any symptoms. This is known as latent infection, and it’s not contagious.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabx00243b72gpqm325q@published"&gt;Eventually, though, the bacteria wake up, and that’s when active infection starts. At that point, the person with the infection is now contagious. The bacteria start eating away at the lungs, destroying tissue. From there, it can move to other parts of the body. Symptoms—prolonged cough, chest pain, weakness, fever—may start off mild. Depending on the person’s age and health, they can suffer from active infection for more than a year, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/tuberculosis-death-usaid-trump/682062/"&gt;losing weight&lt;/a&gt; due to lack of appetite and extreme abdominal pain, until their lungs collapse or fill with fluid—or a few other terrible possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="6" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabx00253b72ej1rwvi1@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But there are treatments available, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabx00263b72teahaxe3@published"&gt;Yes. “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/health/tuberculosis-tb-treatment-vaccine-diagnosis.html?unlocked_article_code=1.7E4.N_z-.-t1g_6WlN_mQ&amp;amp;smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;amp;referringSource=articleShare"&gt;TB is curable and preventable&lt;/a&gt;,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;World Health Organization’s website&lt;/a&gt;. However, treatment isn’t a straightforward one-and-done kind of thing. It involves six months of a multidrug regimen; using just one drug can lead to the bacteria’s becoming resistant such that they simply do not respond to that drug. In some cases, if treatment is implemented incorrectly, a person’s bacteria can become resistant to multiple drugs, which then makes it very difficult to treat. Multidrug-resistant TB is considered a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/tackling-the-drug-resistant-tb-crisis"&gt;pretty serious public health issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3maby00273b729ym04k8z@published"&gt;Crucially, you don’t want something happening in the middle of TB treatment that disrupts a patient’s access to drugs. The Trump administration’s funding cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, which among many other things supports TB treatment programs, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/05-03-2025-funding-cuts-to-tuberculosis-programmes-endanger-millions-of-lives"&gt;are just that kind of disruption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="13" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3maby00283b72lyx3f5w4@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yikes. What about preventing TB in the first place? Is there a vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="33" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3maby00293b72c3a5g2e3@published"&gt;There is one, but it’s not very effective for adults or adolescents. For babies and small children in countries where TB is common, it can help protect against death and more severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3maby002a3b72yx7ikgoo@published"&gt;Finding a new, better TB vaccine is one of the holy grails of vaccinology, says Schaffner, along with better flu and COVID vaccines and an HIV vaccine: “These are at the top of the list of every vaccinologist’s Christmas list.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="19" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3maby002b3b727vbstzhm@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we treat &lt;em&gt;latent &lt;/em&gt;TB, then? Get ahead of things, instead of waiting for the infection to become active?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3maby002c3b72dnh2w94j@published"&gt;We can! And that’s the ideal situation: Find everyone with latent TB and treat them before&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;they become contagious and experience symptoms. “That’s actually part of the plan of every state’s TB program,” says Schaffner. “And we need to do more of that.” You can test for TB with an easy skin test; there’s also a newer blood-test option. The good news is that if you do have latent TB, you don’t have to wait until it becomes active to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/ltbi.htm"&gt;receive treatment&lt;/a&gt; (which is still a regimen of multiple drugs over several months).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="14" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabz002d3b72r3vvm0gj@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, I’m ready to get tested! Point me to the nearest TB testing stand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabz002e3b72jj3nqghu@published"&gt;If you’re near the &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2242/Tuberculosis-Outbreaks"&gt;outbreak in Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, you may be contacted by public health authorities to get tested. In those cases, “please cooperate with the public health authorities, because it’s to your own benefit,” says Schaffner. But in general, we don’t do mass TB testing in the U.S. because there’s no real need. Despite being deadly, TB is not contagious in the way that measles or COVID is—TB typically &lt;a href="https://ehs.unc.edu/topics/infectious-diseases/tuberculosis/"&gt;requires &lt;em&gt;prolonged &lt;/em&gt;exposure&lt;/a&gt;. Certain populations are at higher risk of TB, Schaffner says, including people in low-income areas, people who have been in prison, people with HIV infection, or people raised in countries where TB is more common. Screening is more important in those communities. Other populations, like health care workers, are regularly tested for TB.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="20" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mabz002f3b72q7a54kmv@published"&gt;But if you don’t fall into any of those categories, it’s very, very, very unlikely that you’re harboring TB bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="10" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mac0002g3b72s9eh6itz@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But with TB rates rising in parts of the world …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="140" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mac0002h3b720au1fykt@published"&gt;Right. People in the U.S. are extremely fortunate to not have to think about tuberculosis on the regular. As the richest country in the world, we have a responsibility to help those who are less advantaged. So we should care about the rising cases for humanitarian reasons. But TB in other parts of the world &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/health/usaid-funding-disease-outbreaks.html"&gt;does also concern&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. directly. “Germs don’t need a passport,” says Schaffner. “Whatever’s over there can be over here in 24 hours.” This is true of any infectious disease, and something we saw very clearly with COVID-19. Again, TB is not at all like COVID—and the primary reason to worry about TB is because of the destruction it causes globally, not because of the risk it poses to you personally. But the more TB spreads, the higher your chances of being near an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t3mac0002i3b72rgsqy3dp@published"&gt;Undoubtedly, the cuts to USAID funding—which, in addition to funding prevention, testing, and treatment services, has been the world’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/05-03-2025-funding-cuts-to-tuberculosis-programmes-endanger-millions-of-lives"&gt;third-largest TB research funder&lt;/a&gt;—will lead to more illness and death. It might not be immediately apparent in the data, says Schaffner, because TB is a relatively slow-moving disease. But many lives &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/health/tuberculosis-kenya-us-cuts.html"&gt;are already being affected&lt;/a&gt;. As WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/tuberculosis-returns-top-infectious-disease-killer-who-says-2024-10-29/"&gt;told Reuters&lt;/a&gt;: “The fact that TB still kills and sickens so many people is an outrage, when we have the tools to prevent it, detect it and treat &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and perhaps pass away when they were one or two years old," according to Dr Jamie Duckers, consultant at the All Wales Adult Cystic Fibrosis Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"But the latest data... suggests if you're born now with cystic fibrosis in the UK, half are expected to live to at least 64 years old - and some new data suggests many patients can expect to live much closer to normal life expectancy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Advances have also been made possible through screenings, such as the heel-prick test for babies, but also as Dr Duckers said, through the rollout of ground-breaking new therapies - made possible by clinical trials such as the one Sophie took part in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's a real exemplar of what can be done through research," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 17:57:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1mRUdidzlpNVZDLW51QXBQWHVWdWJjQzAwN215TFhaOGFsNHdpNzNmUFZMR0NMMDFWZUdBbldKUDlVS0hhb3ljSTNtNnRNY2o1YU5fdkZNOFZyUdIBX0FVX3lxTE9feGZVWk9ZM1hQb0s2eE1TRmhzaWotQ2U2WUFNY191ZG9zUkpyVTBzVnFUd0lyazdUajM1LWtkSUJieThIVmN3TXBxcTRoQ2VmRm0zdUdoSTdySF96c0pn</guid></item><item><title>My Daughter Has a Rare Condition That Requires a Specialist.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t2e4kf00233572gv9tpkgm@published"&gt;My 14-year-old, “Kim,” was recently diagnosed with a condition that is not life-threatening but that does need to be managed by a specialist. There are not many specialists, as the condition is relatively rare. She must see this specialist every 4-to-6 weeks for at least a year or two. Our family gets our health insurance from my husband’s employer; if the doctor is in-network, the copays are very affordable. A handful of in-network specialists are within a two-hour drive of our house, and they are all male doctors. The problem is, Kim refuses to see a male doctor, as her condition may require occasional physical examinations on a private area. I totally get Kim’s feelings; I prefer female doctors if they will see me naked, but I will see a male doctor in an emergency or if there are no other options.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t2e4pd00243572j1572s0l@published"&gt;There are one or two female doctors out-of-network that are driving distance, but paying out-of-pocket for monthly visits (not to mention testing if these doctors use only out-of-network labs) will be cost-prohibitive without cutting the budget elsewhere. I am unsure what to do and feel there is no good answer. It does feel wrong to make Kim see a doctor she feels uncomfortable with. On the other hand, I do not want to lessen our contributions to retirement accounts, college funds, and other savings. My daughters (I have two other teens) do one non-school-sponsored extracurricular (music lessons, dance classes, etc.). I do not want this to impact my other girls, and it feels unfair to ask Kim to choose between flute lessons or a female doctor. Forgoing medical care is out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;

I have told her that these male doctors will allow her to have a female nurse or patient advocate in the room with her during the exams and that I (her mom) could go in the examination room with her if she wants me to. But Kim still protests when I bring up seeing the male doctor. What do you think I should do?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t2e4zx002a35725ahtri01@published"&gt;You’re right, there’s really no good answer here. Either Kim will have to get past her discomfort with male doctors, or there will have to be significant financial sacrifices made to accommodate her. I think you should let your daughter know that there are likely to be times in her life when a female doctor may not be an option, such as on a trip to the emergency room; it’s also possible that if she continues to have to manage this rare condition, there may not be female specialists available in the future—it would be best to help her get past this aversion now.&lt;/p&gt;

Reiterate your promise to be in the exam room with her, and alert the practice about your daughter’s anxiety, so that the doctors and staff may be extra sensitive. Gently explain to her that she simply cannot forgo this care and that she has no choice but to allow a man to treat her.&lt;/p&gt;

Ever since last year, when her friend had to drop out because she got long-COVID, my daughter has become obsessed with it. First, she was just obsessively reading articles on health and wellness, but now she’s sending me studies from medical journals about how getting COVID affects all these organs and aspects of the body. Worse yet, now she’s bought this high-end respirator that looks like some kind of space alien mask and refuses to be around people if she’s not wearing it. She’s even talking about changing her major to epidemiology and abandoning her dream of being a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t2e59e002e3572ilfe5er6@published"&gt;I’m worried that she’s alienating herself from her peers and making herself a target for social ostracism. We were reasonably cautious during the pandemic when she was in high school, but I don’t bother masking anymore since we’ve had the virus a few times and it didn’t seem so bad. Now, however, my daughter has me reconsidering the choice to stop masking since she’s constantly telling me about some horrible outcome that someone she read about had from it. I don’t want her to be right about this, especially since this choice is almost certainly hurting her socially, but the more I’ve researched it myself, the more I think she may have a point. How can I help her balance these fears without letting her get totally alienated from her peers for being the weird girl in the mask?&lt;/p&gt;

Most of us stopped taking COVID seriously a couple of years ago, but it is still very much out here; furthermore, long-COVID sufferers are experiencing devastating symptoms, and we still don’t know all the long-term effects of even a short course of the virus. It seems unreasonable to me to be concerned about the social impact on your daughter when it sounds like she’s taking wise steps to protect herself from what could be a devastating illness, particularly when you consider what happened to her classmate.&lt;br&gt;Ask yourself, does she have meaningful friendships? Has her social life suffered since she started taking COVID more seriously, or are you just assuming that the respirator turns people off?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t2ko4c00363572vj3pwh6i@published"&gt;As a compromise, you could encourage her to continue masking up but ask her to consider a less obtrusive N95 mask for situations in which she needs to interact with people, such as at school or at family functions. But honestly, it sounds like she knows what she’s doing here better than a lot of us do. If your daughter’s concern about this starts to turn into a true fixation or obsession, in the sense that it is damaging the rest of her life, get her to a therapist to parse out sensible protection from problematic anxiety. But for now, I’d say let her take care of her own health as she chooses.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t understand why he can do all these things for someone new who won’t even give him a place to stay, but not me? What’s wrong with me?&lt;/p&gt;

He’ll only see him if I’m not there, but if I say fine, he gets mad at me and accuses me of wanting to go be with other men during that time. I’m at my wit’s end. Should I wait and hope this passes and that he will come to his senses? Do I write him a letter about how sad I am? Should I contact his mother or aunt? I used to tell his dad about how his son was behaving, and he would set him straight, but he died recently. I just want this whole ordeal to end.&lt;/p&gt;

He abused you during the relationship and continues to abuse you via text message. There is nothing wrong with you that is preventing your ex from treating you the way you deserve to be treated. He is not a good guy, and you know that. Instead of agonizing over what he may or may not be doing for his alleged new woman (whom he may be fabricating just to get under your skin), you need to be focused on taking care of yourself and your child. Why would you want a man who mistreats you, doesn’t work, and uses his relationship to you to determine if he sees his son or not?&lt;/p&gt;

I am assuming that this guy doesn’t voluntarily give you money for your child. If you could use some additional support, consider going through the process of having him forced to pay child support through the court system. As far as facilitating visits goes, see if you can coordinate through his mother or aunt so you don’t have to deal with him harassing you about what you’re doing during that time. Let this man know that you are interested in allowing him to have a relationship with his son, but that you will only be willing to do that if he can both treat you with respect and be consistent. If he is unwilling to accept these terms, then do away with visitation.&lt;/p&gt;

Has your son been a witness to how his father talks to you? If not, would you want him to see that? If so, have you considered the impact that may have on his relationships with women in the future? Would you want your son to grow up to be like his father? You have to (quickly) dry your eyes and move past your interest in this guy. The only thing he can do for you is step-up and be an active father to your child. If he refuses to do that, then you need to eliminate him from your life altogether. But the longer you hold on to the fantasy of having him as a partner, the longer he’ll be able to hurt you, and that will certainly impact your child in ways you do not want.&lt;/p&gt;

Breathing patterns don’t just support life—they may directly influence memory, either boosting it or holding it back. With breathing-focused practices like meditation and mindfulness gaining traction, scientists are taking a closer look at the hidden powers of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between breath and brain isn’t just theoretical. Researchers now believe that the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-how-the-human-brain-coordinates-speaking-and-breathing/"&gt;rhythm of your breathing&lt;/a&gt; may steer how your brain forms and stores memories. This insight could open the door to new ways of treating mental health issues and brain disorders, giving people more tools to manage their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_the_medulla_controls_breathing"&gt;How the Medulla Controls Breathing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breathing feels automatic, but it's guided by deep brain activity. At the center of this system is a tiny structure in the brainstem called the Pre-Bötzinger Complex, or PreBötC. This tight group of neurons works like a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/intelligent-brain-pacemaker-revolutionizes-parkinsons-disease-treatment/"&gt;pacemaker&lt;/a&gt; for breath, keeping it steady even while you sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PreBötC lives within the medulla oblongata, a part of the brain that handles breathing without conscious effort. While its job in basic survival is clear, scientists are now realizing it might do more—possibly helping the brain filter information and store memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Drawings (adapted from ref. 33) and diagrams showing a transparent acrylic box surrounded by walls (a) and the conditioning paradigm (b, see “Methods”). c Each epoch alternated between offset time blocks (light orange zone) and onset time blocks (tones, light green zone).

"Although details of respiratory function on brain states remain unclear, recent studies suggest that respiration may play an important role during online brain states."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_neural_connection_between_respiration_and_memory"&gt;The Neural Connection Between Respiration and Memory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, Nakamura’s team ran experiments on mice that had been genetically modified. By disrupting the animals’ natural breathing rhythm through the PreBötC, they noticed an unexpected effect: memory loss. The mice struggled to recognize objects and failed tests linked to fear memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drop in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/first-ever-recording-reveals-what-happens-in-our-brain-as-we-die/"&gt;memory performance&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t random. It revealed just how tightly breathing is tied to cognitive function. Even short pauses in normal respiratory activity had a measurable effect on how well the brain processed and retained information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, these pauses in breathing weren't inconsequential to the brain's overall function. They influenced the activity of the hippocampus, a region crucial for both long-term and short-term memory storage, especially during the process of memory recall. When these mice were subjected to irregular &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breathing-is-the-master-clock-of-the-sleeping-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;breathing patterns&lt;/a&gt;, their memory performance notably improved. However, slowing their breathing deteriorated their ability to recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="linking_breathing_transitions_and_memory_performance"&gt;Linking Breathing Transitions and Memory Performance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A preceding research endeavor by the same team had made noteworthy revelations. They found that an expiratory-to-inspiratory (EI) transition or an inspiratory onset during &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/memory-capacity-of-the-human-brain-is-10x-more-than-previously-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory tasks&lt;/a&gt; could impair memory retrieval in humans. Such a transition from exhaling to inhaling either at the onset or mid-task led to diminished speed and accuracy in recalling information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A subsequent study fortified this claim by employing brain scans. These scans established a correlation between subpar memory performance and the deactivation of the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) – a multifunctional brain region responsible for assimilating information from internal and external environments and determining the suitable reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Drawings showing the PreBötzinger complex (PreBötC), prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus.

This reset might be a contributing factor in the observed &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/blocking-this-key-enzyme-can-substantially-improve-memory-in-older-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory performance&lt;/a&gt; variances in the mice. However, these implications need further validation, particularly in human subjects, pointing to an exciting direction for upcoming studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_broader_implications"&gt;The Broader Implications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the nexus between breathing and the brain isn't novel – considering breathing exercises have been long recognized for their &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/does-a-very-high-dose-of-cbd-affect-driving-surprising-study-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;calming effects&lt;/a&gt; – this research introduces a fresh perspective. As the study team suggests, intentional modifications in our breathing patterns could serve therapeutic purposes beyond relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elucidating this, Nakamura remarks, "The determination of detailed roles of respiration and molecular mechanisms in the brain is a subject to future research to understand effects of stress tolerance." He further emphasizes, "The way of breathing manipulation and application of breathing exercises will be crucial for treatment and therapy of depression and neuropsychiatric disorders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Correlation between neuronal activation and behavioral factors.

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8hgd000v26p2d046fslg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On March 10, Dr. Nisha Acharya got a letter from the National Institutes of Health terminating her grant to study the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine recommended for all adults 50 and older in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400022e6b7o1s5hy5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The grant was canceled after a change in NIH policy to not “prioritize research activities that focus on gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment,” according to the termination letter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400032e6baq6nlbmr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The policy shift was no surprise: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, now leads the US Department of Health and Human Services.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400042e6bbpuppzvi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What was surprising about her grant cancellation is that she’s not studying vaccine hesitancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400052e6b38c6vl67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rather, in a written description of her research, Acharya said, “I had the words ‘hesitancy’ and ‘vaccine’ in the same sentence.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400062e6bu2xdo68n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She thinks her funding was caught in a dragnet of NIH grant cancellations driven by haphazard, error-prone word searches rather than careful review of the research in question. HHS has not clarified how it is selecting grants for termination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400072e6bqjuoqrpc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over the past few weeks, the NIH has canceled at least two dozen grants to researchers who were looking at ways to increase vaccination rates or fight vaccine hesitancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400082e6bz48qah1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The changes come as scientists and universities are already reeling from cuts to funding for research about &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/nih-climate-change-funding-propublica/index.html"&gt;climate science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/25/health/hiv-research-funding-cut/index.html"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and many other topics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400092e6b2qgxdyat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Acharya, the cancellation wipes out just over three years of funding on her current grant that she says is worth almost $2 million in direct and indirect costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc4000a2e6bfqqz8e2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a result, she plans to lay off three full-time employees who were working with her to analyze large amounts of data related to the vaccine. Acharya, a clinician scientist at the University of California at San Francisco, will keep her job seeing patients, although the grant paid about 35% of her salary, which she used for time to conduct research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000b2e6b7y31dpyp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t have a way of continuing this work,” said Acharya, who is planning to appeal the decision.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            During his Senate confirmation hearings, Kennedy, a lawyer, testified that he was “pro-safety” and “pro-good science.” He denied being anti-vaccine and has said he wants people to know the risks and benefits of the vaccinations before they get them, a principle called informed consent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000d2e6b0nz7wey1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s what Acharya wants, too. She believes that studies on vaccine hesitancy are valid and worthwhile and should continue to be funded — but it’s not what she’s studying.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000e2e6blya06h2k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m not anti-vax. I am pro-science, whether it’s positives or negatives,” she said. “I understand that with any medicine, any vaccine, there may be things that are very good and things that people may need to be cautious about. That is the goal, right?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000g2e6b6c7xkf79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acharya is an ophthalmologist, or eye doctor, who studies inflammatory diseases of the eye. Until March 10, she was studying the benefits and risks of the shingles vaccine, particularly as it relates to an infection called herpes zoster ophthalmicus: shingles in the nerves around the eye. This complication is painful and can lead to blindness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000h2e6ba64nln49@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 1 in 3 adults will have shingles at some point in their lives, and Acharya said that 10% to 20% of those cases will involve shingles of the eye.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000i2e6bemutwkr5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The clinical trials that test vaccines can tell researchers whether a shot will generally be effective at preventing the more severe complications of an infection. Clinical trials can also catch common safety issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000j2e6bqt1ceztv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But rare side effects and adverse events from vaccines often aren’t picked up until they’re launched across the population and used by hundreds of thousands of people of different ages and sexes and with different underlying conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000k2e6bmtv0zu06@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acharya was studying all those questions related to the Shingrix vaccine, which landed on the US market in 2018. It is recommended for all adults 50 and older to prevent painful bouts of shingles, a reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000l2e6bovuprocr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acharya said she saw an opportunity to gather more data. “Those trials that led to FDA approval did not include people who had had shingles already. They don’t really include people who are sick or had a lot of medical problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000m2e6bm25zahx4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need to really understand how well the vaccine is working for different age groups, for different people, maybe people who have different comorbidities or different conditions, like who are immunocompromised, people who already have had shingles, already have had shingles on the eye. There’s all these questions that we have no data for, no information,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000o2e6bvrbgvysk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She applied for and won a grant through the NIH to study these questions. It’s a highly competitive process that requires months of work to prepare and submit, and goes through rounds of review from peers before it’s awarded.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000p2e6bslbb4tyk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After her first five-year grant, Acharya was able to show that her work had produced important findings: for example, that the vaccine was safe and effective at preventing shingles – including around the eye – in people who had not had it before. So the NIH awarded her another round of five-year funding to continue.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000q2e6b951m3r2x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said she wanted her second round of research to dig into a question that made her fellow ophthalmologists hesitant to recommend the vaccine to their patients: Many of them had seen people who got the vaccine experience a dangerous reawakening of the virus in their eyes. Was it a coincidence or a real risk?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000r2e6ba70vd6g3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m in a very specialized field, and we actually have a little bit of concern in this very specialized subgroup of people who already have shingles in the eye,” Acharya said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000s2e6bvm3ux9ed@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acharya wanted to see whether it was true that the vaccine could trigger another bout of shingles inflammation. In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2814944?resultClick=1" target="_blank"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology, she showed that it could — an important safety consideration. GSK did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sxw9zu00003b6moim18g87@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the study, Acharya urged more monitoring of patients. She imagined that this data might eventually be used to refine recommendations about who should get the vaccine. But it was just the first study; more research is needed for such a change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000t2e6bo048trak@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, her grant was cancelled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rwq6e000013b6m9x1dmuol@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS didn’t answer specific questions about how it was deciding to terminate grants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000v2e6b2katgn8x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “HHS is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities. At HHS, we are dedicated to restoring our agencies to their tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science. As we begin to Make America Healthy Again, it’s important to prioritize research that directly affects the health of Americans. We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again,” an HHS official said in a statement to CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000w2e6bdwbs0v6n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acharya calls it “ironic” that her grant was flagged. “I never got to explain.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000x2e6bg699um14@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She says the program officers overseeing her grant at the NIH knew her work well, and “they didn’t have any part in this decision.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000z2e6b0qleb9n6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The letter gives her 30 days to appeal the termination if she believes that it was made in error, and the appeal goes directly to Dr. Matthew Memoli, who has been acting director of the agency while new NIH Director &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/health/jay-bhattacharya-confirmation-hearing-nih/index.html"&gt;Dr. Jay Bhattacharya&lt;/a&gt; was awaiting confirmation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            What really makes Acharya sad is the effect of the funding cuts on her colleagues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc500122e6bju799pyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I can’t save them,” she said. “I’m trying to call people and try to get jobs for them. I’m trying to set up interviews and stuff, but it’s really hard.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc500142e6brqqrl23s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Universities have lost so much federal research funding that many are coping with their own grant cancellations and doing their own belt-tightening. There’s a &lt;a href="https://chancellor.ucsf.edu/news/uc-hiring-freeze-and-financial-outlook" target="_blank"&gt;hiring freeze&lt;/a&gt; at UCSF.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It’s not these people’s fault that they ended up being in a research group that was good, it was so promising, and their careers would have been made, and now it’s gone, and they’re gonna be out of a job,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Adenosine is a molecule that helps regulate bodily functions like sleep, blood pressure, and heart rate—and when caffeine blocks these receptors, the body responds by making you feel more awake, focused, and energized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The downside? This impact can also lead to physical sensations like increased heart rate, rapid breathing, and muscle tension—all symptoms that may mimic anxiety.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-coffee-can-cause-anxiousness" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;Why Coffee Can Cause Anxiousness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Can coffee cause anxiety even in non-anxious people? The short answer: usually no, but there are exceptions. “In the general population, you don’t see people who generate anxiety disorders if they drink about one to three cups of coffee per day,” says &lt;a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/2183/bio" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/2183/bio" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Astrid Nehlig" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="15.1.0"&gt;Astrid Nehlig&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a neuroscientist and research director at &lt;a href="https://www.ilae.org/astrid-nehlig" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ilae.org/astrid-nehlig" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="INSERM" data-node-id="15.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="15.3.0"&gt;INSERM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Strasbourg, France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;However, if you feel like you are the chillest person in the room yet feel on edge after drinking coffee, there are a few instances related to genetics variation, metabolization, and the amount/frequency of coffee intake—in which experts say coffee &lt;em data-node-id="16.1"&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; certainly trigger anxiety—even in non-anxious people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="17" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Gene Variation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Nehlig, who is also the editor-in-chief of &lt;em data-node-id="18.1"&gt;Epilepsy&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em data-node-id="18.3"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  explains that a particular &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29514871/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29514871/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="genetic variation" data-node-id="18.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;genetic variation&lt;/a&gt; exists that can mess with how your body regulates dopamine and wakefulness, making you more sensitive to caffeine. However, the variation is “quite rare, affecting only about 5 percent of the population, ” she notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;On top of that, having this gene variation also makes you a "slow caffeine metabolizer," Nehlig says—which means your body takes longer to break down caffeine. You would likely only know that you have this genetic variation if you have done genetic testing via your doctor or an at-home genetic testing health kit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="metabolization" data-node-id="20" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;Metabolization&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The metabolization factor, or how fast the body breaks down the caffeine in your coffee, affects your sensitivity to coffee. Usually, the half-life of caffeine is between three and five hours. However, “The population is evenly distributed between fast and slow metabolizers of coffee, and how long the half-life of coffee remains in their system can be a determinant of how sensitive people are to caffeine,” says Nehlig. This is why some people can drink multiple cups of coffee in a short time without issues, while others start feeling jittery or anxious after just one cup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Fast caffeine metabolizers break down caffeine quickly, so they can have two to three cups over six hours without much buildup in their system. On the other hand, slow caffeine metabolizers process caffeine more slowly, so it stays in their system longer. As they continue drinking coffee, the caffeine accumulates, making them more likely to experience side effects like anxiety and jitteriness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="caffeine-consumption-level-and-frequency" data-node-id="23" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.0"&gt;Caffeine Consumption Level And Frequency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The last and most common instance in which coffee can cause non-anxious people anxiety is the amount of caffeine consumption. As a general rule, “If you drink too much coffee or too much caffeine in other forms, then it’s contraindicated for you and you will start raising anxiety,” says Nehlig. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Coffee naturally has a larger concentration of caffeine than some other caffeinated drinks. The exact amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee depends on the coffee variety, region it comes from, brewing method, and serving size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The recommended amount? The &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="FDA" data-node-id="26.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="26.1.0"&gt;FDA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cites 400 milligrams per day—which is about four or five cups of coffee—as a safe amount for adults. “In most people, it's just finding the right level under which they have no anxiety,” says Nehlig, who adds that no more than 200 mg per sitting and no more than 400 mg a day of caffeine should be exceeded regardless of the source of caffeine including teas, matcha, sodas, and energy drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="27" class="body-h4 css-lviy4r emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="27.0"&gt;How much caffeine is in these common drinks (12 oz.), according to the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="FDA" data-node-id="27.0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="28" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0.0"&gt;Decaf coffee:&lt;/strong&gt; 2 to 15 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.1.0"&gt;Green tea: &lt;/strong&gt;30 to 50 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.2.0"&gt;Soft drinks&lt;/strong&gt;: 23 to 83 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.3.0"&gt;Matcha&lt;/strong&gt;: 35 to 130 mg &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.4"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.4.0"&gt;Black tea&lt;/strong&gt;: 25 to 48 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.5"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.5.0"&gt;Energy drinks:&lt;/strong&gt; 80 to 200 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.6"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.6.0"&gt;Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;: 113 to 247 mg (depending on brewing method)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Ever wondered why drinking coffee affects you differently than drinking matcha or green tea? The bottom line is that coffee in and of itself is probably not causing your anxiety.

But in practice, both Nehlig and Dr. Sultan say there isn’t enough research to recommend adding L-theanine supplements to coffee for this purpose—mainly because there’s currently no research that proves a benefit, or explores the implications of combining these chemical compounds. “It's true that tea is making you less nervous, but there is twice or even three times less caffeine, which might already be an explanation,” says Nehlig. So, the L-theanine may not have anything to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Instead, Dr. Sultan recommends drinking L-theanine from sources that naturally contain it already like tea and matcha rather than adding an L-theanine supplement to coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-enjoy-your-coffee-sans-anxiousness" data-node-id="36" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="36.0"&gt;How To Enjoy Your Coffee Sans Anxiousness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Our experts reiterate that caffeine itself doesn’t usually cause anxiety but can make it worse if you’re already prone to it. However, if you do think your caffeine intake is bringing out anxiousness for you, consider cutting back or kicking the habit entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If coffee makes you feel jittery, try channeling that energy into movement, like a quick walk. If you’re especially sensitive, Nehlig recommends switching from Robusta (which has twice the caffeine of Arabica) to a lower-caffeine Arabica variety like Bourbon Pointu. And if caffeine still feels like too much, decaf lets you enjoy coffee’s perks without the buzz. Bonus tip: Pair your coffee with food instead of drinking it on an empty stomach to soften the impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;You can enjoy your coffee—just tweak your routine to make it work for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img data-dynamic-svg="true" src="/_assets/design-tokens/womenshealthmag/static/images/logos/lettermark.f613c4d.svg?primary=%2523000" loading="lazy" data-testid="dynamic-svg-base" alt="Lettermark" class="css-7mevzh ev8dhu50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;div class="css-19s3ilq ev8dhu54"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doris Alvarez is a freelance writer covering women’s health, lifestyle trends, and cultural issues.

Vitamin A at very high doses — high doses that you would never administer by yourself at home — but high-dose vitamin A administered in the hospital has shown to reduce both mortality and duration and severity of [measles] illness,” Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lack of truth in the statement he made is that giving vitamin A in the form of cod liver oil as like a panacea for all the people in Texas ... is unequivocally wrong,” Patel added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cod liver oil as a measles treatment has not been studied, said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/joelbervell/?igsh=ZWd1dTBxMjk5bjYy" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Joel Bervell" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e6a46ee4b086a4e8de55cf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/joelbervell/?igsh=ZWd1dTBxMjk5bjYy" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Joel Bervell&lt;/a&gt;, a recent medical graduate and medical myth-buster on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not the same as vitamin A supplementation,” Bervell explained. “I think the reason why he was talking about cod oil in the first place was it has high levels of vitamin A, but the amount of vitamin A that’s in cod oil can vary widely, and relying on that instead of vaccines can be risky.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplementation for children just generally can also be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a blanket statement, I would never give my kids cod liver oil because we know the supplement industry is not very well regulated,” Patel explained. “I don’t like giving my kids any supplements, because the truth is, you have no idea what’s in them.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More, taking too much of any vitamin, including vitamin A, can lead to complications and toxicity, Bervell said. “It can cause ... liver damage to fatigue to hair loss and headaches.” According to Texas Public Radio, the hospitalized children who are now being treated for vitamin A toxicity have abnormal liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A also can interact with other medications, which can lead to more problems, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Vitamin A isn’t going to prevent someone from getting the measles, and it’s also not proven to help with symptoms for patients who aren’t hospitalized, according to Patel. Ingesting high amounts of vitamin A or cod liver oil can lead to real health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope RFK knows that what he says is what parents are going to do,” Bervell said. “If they’re believing that either vitamin A or cod oil is a replacement for vaccines, that’s going to do their children, and the rest of communities in these areas, more harm than good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Getting the measles vaccine is the best way to protect yourself from infection.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is what actually works when it comes to protecting yourself from the measles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect yourself and your loved ones from measles, your best bet is to get the MMR vaccine if you haven’t already, Patel stressed. The typical guidance is for children to get the first dose of the two-dose shot at 12 months, but children as young as 6 months can get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re in any pocket of the country that has had a measles case, I would 100% get my child vaccinated early if they were over 6 months,” Patel said, adding that she also encourages people to get their kids the shots early if they are traveling internationally somewhere with measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the second dose of the measles vaccine is typically given to children between 4 and 6 years old, you can also get their second dose early as long as it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="at least 28 days" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e6a46ee4b086a4e8de55cf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;at least 28 days&lt;/a&gt; since their first dose, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After the first dose, you’re 93% protected against the measles. After the second dose, you’re 97% protected,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adults who don’t know their vaccination status or older adults who could have waning measles protection, Patel recommended that you get your titers drawn. This is done via a blood test that measures antibody levels in your blood. You can talk to your primary care doctor about this option to get set up with a test. If your measles antibody levels are low, you can get another MMR shot for protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical experts think there needs to be a larger focus on vaccination by the current administration. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In previous years when we see measles outbreaks, health officials have said we need to have an increase in public health information out there about why people need vaccinations,” Bervell said. “I haven’t seen that to the same degree with this administration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. continues to call vaccination a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="personal decision" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e6a46ee4b086a4e8de55cf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;personal decision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to be making sure that we understand the importance of vaccines right now,” Bervell said, and added that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Food and Drug Administration need to be more focused on putting accurate information out about why the measles vaccine, specifically, is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

There’s also increased demand for cod liver oil at local stores, according to Texas Public Radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals are concerned that this vitamin A misinformation could continue to spread and result in people not understanding what’s actually best for measles treatment and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what medical experts want everyone to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin A is not an at-home treatment or prevention tool for measles, but RFK Jr.’s vitamin A thoughts do come from somewhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Like much of what RFK says, there’s always a kernel of truth, which he sort of manipulates to legitimize the things he’s saying, which I know is a strong statement, but at this point I think it’s very important to say strong statements about it because if we are not clear in our responses, they easily get manipulated,” said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/anitakpatelmd/?hl=en" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Anita Patel" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e6a46ee4b086a4e8de55cf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/anitakpatelmd/?hl=en" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Dr. Anita Patel&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric critical care doctor in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is evident in Kennedy’s claims about vitamin A, according to Patel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The kernel of truth is that he’s right. Vitamin A at very high doses — high doses that you would never administer by yourself at home — but high-dose vitamin A administered in the hospital has shown to reduce both mortality and duration and severity of [measles] illness,” Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lack of truth in the statement he made is that giving vitamin A in the form of cod liver oil as like a panacea for all the people in Texas ... is unequivocally wrong,” Patel added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cod liver oil as a measles treatment has not been studied, said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/joelbervell/?igsh=ZWd1dTBxMjk5bjYy" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Joel Bervell" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e6a46ee4b086a4e8de55cf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/joelbervell/?igsh=ZWd1dTBxMjk5bjYy" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Joel Bervell&lt;/a&gt;, a recent medical graduate and medical myth-buster on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not the same as vitamin A supplementation,” Bervell explained. “I think the reason why he was talking about cod oil in the first place was it has high levels of vitamin A, but the amount of vitamin A that’s in cod oil can vary widely, and relying on that instead of vaccines can be risky.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplementation for children just generally can also be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a blanket statement, I would never give my kids cod liver oil because we know the supplement industry is not very well regulated,” Patel explained. “I don’t like giving my kids any supplements, because the truth is, you have no idea what’s in them.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More, taking too much of any vitamin, including vitamin A, can lead to complications and toxicity, Bervell said. “It can cause ... liver damage to fatigue to hair loss and headaches.” According to Texas Public Radio, the hospitalized children who are now being treated for vitamin A toxicity have abnormal liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A also can interact with other medications, which can lead to more problems, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Vitamin A isn’t going to prevent someone from getting the measles, and it’s also not proven to help with symptoms for patients who aren’t hospitalized, according to Patel. Ingesting high amounts of vitamin A or cod liver oil can lead to real health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope RFK knows that what he says is what parents are going to do,” Bervell said. “If they’re believing that either vitamin A or cod oil is a replacement for vaccines, that’s going to do their children, and the rest of communities in these areas, more harm than good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Getting the measles vaccine is the best way to protect yourself from infection.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is what actually works when it comes to protecting yourself from the measles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect yourself and your loved ones from measles, your best bet is to get the MMR vaccine if you haven’t already, Patel stressed. The typical guidance is for children to get the first dose of the two-dose shot at 12 months, but children as young as 6 months can get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re in any pocket of the country that has had a measles case, I would 100% get my child vaccinated early if they were over 6 months,” Patel said, adding that she also encourages people to get their kids the shots early if they are traveling internationally somewhere with measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the second dose of the measles vaccine is typically given to children between 4 and 6 years old, you can also get their second dose early as long as it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="at least 28 days" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e6a46ee4b086a4e8de55cf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;at least 28 days&lt;/a&gt; since their first dose, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After the first dose, you’re 93% protected against the measles. After the second dose, you’re 97% protected,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adults who don’t know their vaccination status or older adults who could have waning measles protection, Patel recommended that you get your titers drawn. This is done via a blood test that measures antibody levels in your blood. You can talk to your primary care doctor about this option to get set up with a test. If your measles antibody levels are low, you can get another MMR shot for protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical experts think there needs to be a larger focus on vaccination by the current administration. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In previous years when we see measles outbreaks, health officials have said we need to have an increase in public health information out there about why people need vaccinations,” Bervell said. “I haven’t seen that to the same degree with this administration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. continues to call vaccination a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="personal decision" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e6a46ee4b086a4e8de55cf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;personal decision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to be making sure that we understand the importance of vaccines right now,” Bervell said, and added that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Food and Drug Administration need to be more focused on putting accurate information out about why the measles vaccine, specifically, is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

                                &lt;p&gt;Sixteen people in Yakima County have active cases of tuberculosis, according to Yakima Health District officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven cases are being monitored by the Yakima Health District and nine are being monitored by Indian Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agencies are working to identify and test anyone that may have been exposed to the disease, Stephanie Ruiz, Yakima Health District spokesperson said in an email. The first case in the county was confirmed in September, but not all active cases are linked to the same outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are in the Lower Valley, but specific cities and locations are not released to protect patient privacy, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severity of cases can vary, Melissa Sixberry, director of disease control for the Yakima Health District said at a Board of Health meeting on Wednesday. Some people may experience a mild cough, but others may take a long time to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a large number compared to what we normally would be managing," Sixberry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis patients must have their treatment observed daily, which can cause a strain on health resources, Sixberry said. The county has been using video visits, but Indian Health Services must go to the patient to do it in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Treatment can go anywhere from four months to 12 months," Sixberry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people can receive their treatment at home, Ruiz said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis, or TB, is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/causes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;respiratory disease caused by a bacteria&lt;/a&gt; and spread through the air when an infected person coughs or speaks, according to the CDC. Without treatment, it can be fatal. Some people can have the disease without symptoms, called inactive TB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of exposure is low unless you have prolonged exposure to an infected person, Ruiz said. Anyone with concerns should speak with their primary care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In other news&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yakima County has had 12 flu deaths since the season began in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Activity is still high," Sixberry said in the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been no pediatric deaths in the county, but there have been elsewhere in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with additional information from the health district.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
