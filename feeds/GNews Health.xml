Her paediatrician also advised her to move up her older son's second shot of the vaccine - the full course for the immunisation - as the risk to his health grows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Mentally, it's taking a toll on me, thinking about not just myself and my child, but also about the people that I have to be around," said Leah, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The US declared measles "eliminated" from the country in 2000, but in recent years, as anti-vaccine sentiments rose, the country has seen several outbreaks of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Texas outbreak began in a small Mennonite community near Lubbock, home to 260,000, and has since spread. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak "not unusual", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Public health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions," Leah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;In Lubbock, worried parents and doctors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Since the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic," she told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;That includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting. His wife is nine months pregnant and plans to deliver in the same hospital where the patient died of the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b30e/live/f6a065e0-f5fe-11ef-a576-211c964a64b2.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b30e/live/f6a065e0-f5fe-11ef-a576-211c964a64b2.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b30e/live/f6a065e0-f5fe-11ef-a576-211c964a64b2.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b30e/live/f6a065e0-f5fe-11ef-a576-211c964a64b2.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b30e/live/f6a065e0-f5fe-11ef-a576-211c964a64b2.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b30e/live/f6a065e0-f5fe-11ef-a576-211c964a64b2.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b30e/live/f6a065e0-f5fe-11ef-a576-211c964a64b2.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b30e/live/f6a065e0-f5fe-11ef-a576-211c964a64b2.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Kyle Rable Kyle Rable and his wife expecting a baby boy" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Kyle Rable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Kyle Rable and his wife are extremely concerned for their son's first year of life, when he cannot be vaccinated&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Rable is terrified for his son's first year of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"With it spreading essentially like wildfire out here, do we just not leave our house for a year? We can't do that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;To achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community," said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Now, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I share that concern with them," said Dr Malbari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Kennedy stays mum on vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Before Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine skeptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;During his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to "do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult" to get vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Kennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of "informed consent" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is "what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In addition to calling the Texas outbreak "not unusual", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ron Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's a devastating disease," he said. "And it's completely preventable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Vaccines as a 'choice'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Leah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs. After the death was announced on Wednesday, around 18 people came to a vaccination clinic following many slow days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Still, she said, when she tells parents their children may have been exposed, some still do not want to vaccinate, including doses of the shot that can protect them after potential exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"In Texas, vaccines are very much a choice," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Local health officials are working overtime to build trust and show that the vaccine is safe and effective, Dr Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We're seeing some success, but we would like to see significantly more," he said.  "It would be nice to have some confidence coming out of the powers that be - at the national level - to show that this is a good vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 08:33:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE81eGNfdEFQT2txcG1aY2pzSWhlWEtveFUyMXg0d013VUxIWTdTSFkzWkNXTGJYSE1rdXNFNVQ5Wi1DbGpBMWpsaTR5QlN2VjJIWEZlWTNOQ19MUdIBX0FVX3lxTE1WS0sxOHpVOXFMM0RwdzMyblpxa3hKNFBwSjYtVk1QN1V5dGFpMTlTWXdYR1pUOW9KVWdNWFRmWWFlNHctSXdmQTF3VkdONkFzS0VseDVjTHVlaW14TkJn</guid></item><item><title>Health officials say they have a confirmed measles case reported in Austin - KVUE.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNR25GdUFGWXdPQnlFQjJvLVZWMGZQb2JWalVteUR1cWo0RnQ1a1hjOS1ZYUtuc0tVenJxVlJwbUFTbHp5empMNGpiR0xaTWFKaTRIOER6WFNNRk8zR3Znbi1xdjNPNkktMS1vR3hBRzd2cWNFdVdaVGU1WldEaUp5Z2x6bDByRHc1aHM2aGZ5ZHpRMkRBSU1qRXktZDJacTR3enFwNTAyNnlVdTQ0S2RISmpXR01aUDA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Most of the recent confirmed measles cases in Texas have been in the South Plains region, but this patient was exposed to the disease while traveling overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, Texas — Health officials say they have confirmed a case of measles in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a press briefing Friday, Austin Public Health confirmed that an unvaccinated infant was exposed to measles while traveling overseas. Everyone else in the child's family is vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials said contact tracing is complete and they don't expect additional exposures. The child and their family members are all isolated at home.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It certainly raises our level of concern, our level of readiness, but we've been ready," Austin Travis County Public Health Authority Dr. Desmar Walkes said. "We've been planning for over a year for the possibility of a measles outbreak because we've known that our vaccination rate has been declining. We've been working hard to get people vaccinated, and we're calling for people to get vaccinated now, if they're unvaccinated, to protect themselves."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walkes said the case is not related to an ongoing measles outbreak in the South Plains region of Texas, where &lt;a target="_blank" href="/article/news/health/measles/measles-outbreak-texas-2025-update/285-dded2ec7-e37b-42f7-8adb-2956fdb329bc"&gt;146 cases have been reported&lt;/a&gt; as of Friday, Feb. 28. Twenty of the patients have been hospitalized, and one unvaccinated child has died, marking the first &lt;a target="_blank" href="/article/news/health/measles/texas-measles-death-outbreak-lubbock/285-636380ac-1d18-4404-999d-b804f40137af"&gt;measles death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. To give you a sense of how contagious this virus is, doctors say if one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The measles virus can survive in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours after the infected person has left the area," Walkes said. "People who have direct contact through coughs or sneezes should monitor for symptoms for up to 21 days after exposure."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local health officials stress that there is no local outbreak, but they say now is the time to take precautions and prepare.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MMR – measles-mumps-rubella – vaccine is highly effective in protecting against measles. According to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC), one dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles and two doses are 97% effective against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know how to combat this, and we need that vaccination rate to increase in our community by coming together, getting vaccinated, and prioritizing public health," Travis County Judge Andy Brown said. "We can do this together. The steps are simple. Get vaccinated if you haven't already."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to state health data, Travis County's MMR vaccination rate among kindergarteners is just under 90%. Doctors say communities need 95% immunization rates to have "herd immunity."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that worries local leaders is the under 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners at some schools, which health officials said increases the risk of an outbreak by 51%.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're continuing to work with those school administrators to get vaccines in arms," Walkes said. "We've been having clinics. Our mobile team has been educating families, and we're continuing that work and that effort. It'll be ongoing until we get the job done and get the message to parents that need to hear it."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said kids as young as a year old can get their first dose of the MMR vaccine and the second when they're between four and six years old. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If everybody else had their kids vaccinated at the proper ages, this would not be an issue," Brown said. "By not vaccinating your child at the proper ages of 12 to 15 months and then again at 4 to 6 years, you're putting other infant children at risk. You're putting our community's lives at risk. You're putting our economy's life at risk."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a parent is going to an area where measles is prevalent, Walkes said the child should be vaccinated earlier, at six to eleven months. Walkes said that guidance may change if we see more cases in the Austin area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we do have an outbreak where we see more than three or more cases in our area, then we will change our guidance," Walkes said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), of the 146 cases, 98 have been reported in Gaines County, and 21 have been reported in nearby Terry County. Most of the cases have been among children. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DSHS reports that 79 of the 146 patients were unvaccinated, 62 have unknown vaccination status, and five have received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is no local outbreak right now, Walkes said she and her team are prepared for the worst but are hoping for the best.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've been in contact with our hospital partners and clinics and folks across our jurisdiction, and they are ready and prepared and have processes in place to handle people who may contact them saying that they have symptoms of measles," Walkes said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another primary concern for local leaders is South by Southwest (SXSW) starting next weekend. As hundreds of thousands of people descend upon Downtown Austin, they don't want that to become a super spreader event. They are encouraging those in the community who aren't vaccinated to get vaccinated. The city and health department say they are working with organizers on health precautions for the event.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We work in collaboration with Austin Special Events to help them mitigate and strategize for health precautions for events," Walkes said. "Our team has been in contact with them and our business partners across the city."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone looking to get the vaccine can do so at doctor's offices and pharmacies. The health department offers the MMR vaccine at its "Shots for Tots" and "Big Shots" clinics. You can find information about those &lt;a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/department/immunizations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Children under the age of 14 do need a prescription from a doctor to get the vaccine at a pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When Kim Kardashian &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvszJqGyfqr/?utm_source=ig_embed"&gt;posted on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; about having had a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/keeping-up-with-advanced-mri-kim-kardashian-promotes-whole-body-scans-could-they-be-worth-the-hype-211676"&gt;full-body MRI&lt;/a&gt;, she enthused that the test can be "life saving", detecting diseases in the earliest stages before symptoms arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Kardashian neglected to say was there's no evidence this expensive scan can bring benefits for &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmri.26736"&gt;healthy people&lt;/a&gt;. She also didn't mention it can carry harms including &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-020-00679-4"&gt;unnecessary diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; and inappropriate treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this post in mind, we wanted to explore what influencers are telling us about medical tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830758"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published today in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, we analyzed nearly 1,000 Instagram and TikTok posts about five popular medical tests which can all do more harm than good to healthy people, including the full-body  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="153564" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found the overwhelming majority of these posts were utterly misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5 controversial tests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get into the details of what we found, a bit about &lt;a href="https://www.researchprotocols.org/2024/1/e56899"&gt;the five tests&lt;/a&gt; included in our study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these tests can be valuable to some, all five carry the risk of overdiagnosis for generally healthy people. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-warning-signs-of-overdiagnosis-110895"&gt;Overdiagnosis&lt;/a&gt; is the diagnosis of a condition which would have never caused symptoms or problems. Overdiagnosis leads to overtreatment, which can cause unnecessary side effects and stress for the person, and wasted resources for the health system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, estimates suggest &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/29-000-cancers-overdiagnosed-in-australia-in-a-single-year-127791"&gt;29,000 cancers a year are overdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt; in Australia alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overdiagnosis is a global problem, and it's driven in part by healthy people having tests like these. Often, they're promoted under the guise of early screening, as a way to "take control" of your health. But most healthy people simply don't need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the five tests we looked at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;full-body MRI scan&lt;/strong&gt; claims to test for up to 500 conditions, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="153564" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Yet there is no proven benefit of the scan for healthy people, and a real risk of unnecessary treatment from "&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmri.26736"&gt;false alarm&lt;/a&gt;" diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;"egg timer" test&lt;/strong&gt; (technically known as the AMH, or anti-mullarian hormone test) is often falsely promoted as a fertility test for healthy women. While it may be beneficial for women within a fertility clinic setting, it cannot reliably predict the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2656811"&gt;chance of a woman conceiving&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/29/3/327/6990969?login=true"&gt;menopause starting&lt;/a&gt;. However, low results can &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/0167482X.2018.1541980?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed#abstract"&gt;increase fear and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and lead to unnecessary and expensive &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29719026/"&gt;fertility treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-cancer early detection blood tests&lt;/strong&gt; are being heavily marketed as the "holy grail of cancer detection", with claims they can screen for more than 50 cancers. In reality,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="153564" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are still a long way from finished. There's &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj.q1706"&gt;no good evidence yet&lt;/a&gt; that the benefits will outweigh the harms of unnecessary cancer diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;gut microbiome test&lt;/strong&gt; of your stool promises "wellness" via early detection of many conditions, from flatulence to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="153564" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, again &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/well/live/microbiome-test.html"&gt;without good evidence of benefit&lt;/a&gt;. There's also concern that test results can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/cclm-2019-0122/html"&gt;wasted resources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testosterone testing&lt;/strong&gt; in healthy men is not supported by any high-quality evidence, with concerns direct-to-consumer advertising &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2612615"&gt;leads men to get tested and take testosterone replacement therapy unnecessarily&lt;/a&gt;. Use of testosterone replacement therapy carries its own risk of potential harms with the long-term safety in relation to heart disease and mortality &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666756822000964?via%3Dihub"&gt;still largely unknown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What we found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with an international group of health researchers, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830758"&gt;we analyzed 982 posts&lt;/a&gt; pertaining to the above tests from across Instagram and TikTok. The posts we looked at came from influencers and account holders with at least 1,000 followers, some with a few million followers. In total, the creators of the posts we included had close to 200 million followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even discounting the bots, that's a massive amount of influence (and likely doesn't reflect their actual reach to non-followers too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of posts were misleading, failing to even mention the possibility of harm arising from taking one of these tests. We found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;87 percent of posts mentioned test benefits, while only 15 percent mentioned potential harms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only 6 percent of posts mentioned the risk of overdiagnosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only 6 percent of posts discussed any scientific evidence, while 34 percent of posts used personal stories to promote the test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;68 percent of influencers and account holders had financial interests in promoting the test (for example, a partnership, collaboration, sponsorship or selling for their own profit in some way).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed medical doctors were slightly more balanced in their posts. They were more likely to mention the harms of the test, and less likely to have a strongly promotional tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As all studies do, ours had some limitations. For example, we didn't analyze comments connected to posts. These may give further insights into the information being provided about these tests, and how social media users perceive them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, our findings add to the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470931/"&gt;growing body of evidence&lt;/a&gt; showing misleading medical information is widespread on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153582" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153582" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PersonBeingPrepardForAScanInAnMRImachine.jpg" alt="Person being prepared for a scan in an MRI machine" class="wp-image-153582 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PersonBeingPrepardForAScanInAnMRImachine.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PersonBeingPrepardForAScanInAnMRImachine-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PersonBeingPrepardForAScanInAnMRImachine-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153582" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-in-blue-denim-jeans-lying-on-bed-f2aDTqfnqfE"&gt;National Cancer Institute/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can we do about it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have proposed a range of solutions including &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/can-we-be-inoculated-against-climate-misinformation-yes-if-we-prebunk-rather-than-debunk-215815"&gt;pre-bunking strategies&lt;/a&gt;, which means proactively educating the public about common misinformation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, solutions like these often place responsibility on the individual. And with all the information on social media to navigate, that's a big ask, even for people with adequate health literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's urgently needed is stronger regulation to prevent misleading information being created and shared in the first place. This is especially important given social media platforms including Instagram are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/meta-is-abandoning-fact-checking-this-doesnt-bode-well-for-the-fight-against-misinformation-246878"&gt;moving away from fact-checking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, remember that if information about medical tests promoted by influencers sounds too good to be true, it probably is.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/247362/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Researchers found that even in healthy individuals, short-term unhealthy eating altered brain function, mimicking effects seen in people with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sing MRI scans, they observed that reduced insulin sensitivity persisted even a week after returning to a normal diet. These findings suggest that the brain adapts rapidly to dietary changes, potentially contributing to long-term weight gain and metabolic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Brain Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; Just five days of a high-calorie diet reduced brain insulin sensitivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasting Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Insulin resistance in the brain persisted even after resuming a normal diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obesity Link:&lt;/strong&gt; This effect mirrors insulin resistance seen in people with obesity and diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;DZD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The number of obese persons has grown significantly in recent decades, which presents significant difficulties for those who are impacted, healthcare systems, and those who provide treatment. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hormone insulin plays a key role in the development of obesity. Up until recently, there have been numerous signs indicating insulin causes neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders, especially in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108002"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Unhealthy body fat distribution and chronic weight gain are linked to the brain’s sensitivity to insulin. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study by the University Hospital of Tübingen, the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), and Helmholtz Munich offers intriguing new insights into the origins of type 2 diabetes and obesity as well as the brain’s function as a critical control center.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obesity has only been officially recognized as a disease in Germany since 2020, despite the fact that it has long been known to cause a number of illnesses, including diabetes, heart attacks, and even cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization has already declared obesity to be an epidemic, affecting over one billion individuals globally and almost 16 million in Germany alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A body mass index of 30 or more is considered obese, and a poor diet and insufficient exercise are frequently cited as the causes of this chronic illness. However, the mechanisms in the body that lead to obesity and cause the disease are more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Obesity and the role of insulin in the brain &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unhealthy body fat distribution and chronic weight gain are linked to the brain’s sensitivity to insulin. What specific functions does insulin perform in the brain, and how does it affect individuals of normal weight?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, Prof. Dr. Stephanie Kullmann and her colleagues at the Tübingen University Hospital for Diabetology, Endocrinology, and Nephrology found the answer to this query.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings demonstrate for the first time that even a brief consumption of highly processed, unhealthy foods (such as chocolate bars and potato chips) causes a significant alteration in the brain of healthy individuals, which may be the initial cause of obesity and type 2 diabetes,” says Prof. Kullmann, the study’s leader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a healthy state, insulin has an appetite-suppressing effect in the brain. However, in people with obesity in particular, insulin no longer regulates eating behavior properly, resulting in insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, in our healthy study participants, the brain shows a similar decrease in sensitivity to insulin after a short-term high calorie intake as in people with obesity,” says Ms. Kullmann. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This effect can even be observed one week after returning to a balanced diet,” she adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is also deputy head of the Metabolic Neuroimaging department at the DZD partner Institute for Diabetes Research and Metabolic Diseases (IDM) of Helmholtz Munich at the University of Tübingen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Focus on the brain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Dr. Andreas Birkenfeld, Medical Director of Internal Medicine IV, Director of the IDM and DZD Board Member, and the study’s final author, concludes, “We assume that the brain’s insulin response adapts to short-term changes in diet before any weight gain occurs and thus promotes the development of obesity and other secondary diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He urges more research on how the brain contributes to the development of obesity and other metabolic illnesses in light of the current findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Short period with far-reaching effects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;29 male volunteers of average weight participated in the study and were split into two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For five days in a row, the first group had to supplement their regular diet with 1500 kcal from highly processed, high-calorie snacks. The extra calories were not consumed by the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups underwent two separate examinations following an initial evaluation. One examination was conducted immediately following the five-day period, and another was conducted seven days after the first group had resumed their regular diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look at the liver’s fat content and the brain’s insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did the fat content of the liver of the first group increase significantly after five days of increased calorie intake. Surprisingly, the significantly lower insulin sensitivity in the brain compared to the control group also persisted one week after returning to a normal diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effect had previously only been observed in obese people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and obesity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8afbdbabdaa98bca2bcf5bdaef6bcbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katrin Weber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dzd-ev.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DZD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Katrin Weber – DZD&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01226-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A short-term, high-caloric diet has prolonged effects on brain insulin action in men&lt;/a&gt;” by Stephanie Kullmann et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A short-term, high-caloric diet has prolonged effects on brain insulin action in men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain insulin responsiveness is linked to long-term weight gain and unhealthy body fat distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that short-term overeating with calorie-rich sweet and fatty foods triggers liver fat accumulation and disrupted brain insulin action that outlasted the time-frame of its consumption in healthy weight men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, brain response to insulin can adapt to short-term changes in diet before weight gain and may facilitate the development of obesity and associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;At least 60 people have died and more than 1,000 have been sickened in Congo’s Équateur Province by the illness, which is characterized by “fever, headache, chills, sweating, stiff neck, muscle aches, multiple joint pain and body aches, a runny or bleeding nose, cough, vomiting and diarrhea,” according to the latest &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/democratic-republic-of-congo/news/democratic-republic-congo-deepens-investigation-cluster-illness-and-community-deaths-equateur?country=Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo&amp;amp;name=Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;W.H.O. report&lt;/a&gt;

But the day before her surgery, she received a shocking call from her doctor: A routine screening had revealed a malignant tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Two thousand things were going through my mind,” said Kaufman, an executive coach and the author of “Crushing the Cancer Curveball.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;She couldn’t form a coherent thought beyond: What should I do now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A diagnosis of a serious illness can be overwhelming, whether it’s happening to you or someone you love.

Trump passed it on to Kennedy, who as HHS secretary not only has the word “health” in his title but also oversees agencies such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kennedy confirmed that the federal government was “following” and “watching” the situation, and added that there already had been two fatalities plus another 20 people hospitalized for what he said was “quarantine.” He went on to say that measles outbreaks were “not unusual,” &lt;/span&gt;noting that the U.S. had 16 outbreaks last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1894806176954753125" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="soliloquy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1894806176954753125" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;soliloquy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; lasted less than 60 seconds ― which, as it turns out, was more than enough time to get &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="multiple things wrong" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;multiple things wrong&lt;/a&gt;.

And while it’s true the U.S. had multiple outbreaks last year, that’s not really relevant context, because the CDC considers any cluster of at least three cases an “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="outbreak" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday, Texas officials were reporting &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-28-2025" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="146 documented cases" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-28-2025" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;146 documented cases&lt;/a&gt;, with more than 90 of them in Gaines County where the outbreak started.

Firsthand knowledge of those dangers is one reason the public not only accepted vaccines but embraced them ― something else Edwards said she saw firsthand as a researcher in the 1970s and 1980s working on the Hib (&lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/haemophilus-influenzae-type-b-hib-vaccine" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Haemophilus influenzae type B" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/haemophilus-influenzae-type-b-hib-vaccine" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="22"&gt;Haemophilus influenzae type B&lt;/a&gt;) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back then, she said, parents eagerly signed up their kids for trial studies because they knew the disease could lead to hearing loss, brain damage and death. And now? Vaccination, she says, has become a victim of its own success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have such a great product that people have just forgotten the diseases,” Edwards said. “And that is a big problem, because if people don’t understand the diseases that you’re trying to protect against, they really don’t dread them, or they don’t fear them, and they don’t really worry about them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see the effects in polling, which has documented falling enthusiasm for vaccines over the last 25 years, with a particularly dramatic drop since COVID-19. (That’s also when attitudes about vaccines developed a sharp partisan divide, with Republican voters becoming far more skeptical than their Democratic counterparts). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not coincidentally, vaccination rates have fallen too. And it is in those communities where vaccination rates have fallen most dramatically that the measles, one of the most easily communicable diseases on the planet, keeps finding a foothold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“If people don't understand the diseases that you're trying to protect against, they really don't dread them, or they don't fear them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Kathryn Edwards, Vanderbilt University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gaines County is one of those places. Countywide more than 17% of schoolchildren received vaccine exemptions, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="public data" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="23"&gt;&lt;span&gt;public data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;; in one school it’s almost 50%. And although some of the people declining vaccination cite religious objection, a bigger factor is the misinformation parents are picking up online and from high-profile influencers, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drjessicagraymd.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Jessica Gray" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.drjessicagraymd.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="24"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jessica Gray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a board-certified family physician in Lubbock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;There have been social media posts locally promoting hosting ‘measles parties’ to encourage natural immunity amongst their children,” Gray, who also hosts ”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.themededitpodcast.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The Med Edit Podcast" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.themededitpodcast.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="25"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Med Edit Podcast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,” told me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These “parties” are an improvised, uncontrolled way of doing the same task a vaccine does with safeguards that prevent actual illness. “As a physician with two young children of my own, and an infant who is under 12 months of age and too young to receive the MMR vaccine, the idea of having a measles party terrifies me. This is like playing roulette with your child’s health.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recent reports suggest that many parents are now rushing to get their kids vaccinated, to protect their children from what they now realize is such a real and serious threat. And that makes sense, given that the vast majority of parents really do want what is best for their kids. Those holding back on vaccines are doing so because they genuinely believe all of the misinformation in circulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;State and local officials have been doing their best to combat those myths, making a loud, consistent case for vaccination.

&lt;p&gt;Talk about a heavy dose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the bulk of news coverage is focused on &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/28/health/studies-show-ozempic-can-lower-risk-of-depression/"&gt;GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; that cause weight loss, licensed pharmacist &lt;a href="https://linktr.ee/your.fav.pharmacist?utm_source=linktree_profile_share&amp;amp;ltsid=85fd47af-8fa3-4c9a-a002-d9eba061f219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Kati Forbes&lt;/a&gt; has spotlighted six medications “that’ll low-key or high-key make you fat or make you gain weight.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most surprising is an over-the-counter drug that’s incredibly popular for allergic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Kati Forbes says six medications are notorious for causing weight gain. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;highwaystarz – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Benadryl&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Histamine, a chemical in our immune system involved in allergic response, also decreases appetite.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, according to the &lt;a href="https://obesitymedicine.org/blog/antihistamines-and-weight-gain-obesity-medicine-association/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Obesity Medicine Association&lt;/a&gt;, “it makes sense an antihistamine would have the opposite effect” and can “interfere with the ‘I’m full’ signal … and lead to overeating.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking to The Post, Forbes notes that first-generation antihistamines like Benadryl and cyproheptadine — which is also used as an appetite stimulant — can cause weight gain, particularly with long-term or continued usage.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Paroxetine (Paxil)&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Paroxetine (Paxil), an antidepressant, is one of the more sedating SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) used for depression, anxiety/OCD, etc.,” said Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SSRIs increase levels of the “feel-good” chemical serotonin in the brain, and Forbes calls Paxil one of the worst offenders when it comes to weight gain. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forbes’s insights on the relationship between antidepressants and weight gain come amid &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/antidepressant-prescriptions-increasing-young-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;growing antidepressant use&lt;/a&gt;, especially among young adults and teens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db377.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;One study found&lt;/a&gt; that about 14% of US adults take an antidepressant. The Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute (HPHCI) notes that people often stop using the drug if they experience weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several psychiatrists in major New York hospitals told &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2002/10/20/darker-side-to-the-911-wonder-pill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Post&lt;/a&gt; they avoid prescribing Paxil as it causes more weight gain and sexual dysfunction than similar drugs — and has the worst withdrawal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mirtazapine, known by the brand name Remeron, is commonly prescribed to patients suffering from PTSD or insomnia. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;doucefleur – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Mirtazepine&lt;/h3&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Mirtazapine, known by the brand name Remeron, is commonly prescribed to patients suffering from PTSD or insomnia. Those with major depressive disorder may be prescribed higher doses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We specifically try to avoid this in patients who are overweight,” explained Forbes. She noted that the same medicine is given to animals as an appetite stimulant to increase body weight. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. James Kocsis, a professor and psychiatrist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, previously told &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2018/05/25/antidepressants-linked-to-the-obesity-epidemic-study/"&gt;The Post&lt;/a&gt; that Remeron (Mirtazapine) “is known to cause weight gain frequently because its anti-histaminic effect makes users sluggish.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@your.fav.pharmacist/video/7287798908095368479" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;related TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, Forbes recommends trazodone as a better, less appetite-amplifying substitute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Forbes notes that second-generation antipsychotics can pump up the plump. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Tiktok/@your.fav.pharmacist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Second-generation antipsychotics&lt;/h3&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459150/#:~:text=Neuroleptics%2C%20also%20known%20as%20antipsychotic,generation%20or%20%22atypical%22%20antipsychotics." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Antipsychotics&lt;/a&gt;, also known as neuroleptics, are used to treat psychosis and schizophrenia. These meds are categorized into two classes — first-generation or “typical” antipsychotics and second-generation or “atypical” antipsychotics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forbes notes that second-generation antipsychotics, especially Zyprexa and Seroquel, can pump up the plump. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The weight gain over a year can be massive, up to 30 to 50 pounds for some patients,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Antipsychotics affect neuropeptides, the signaling molecules associated with appetite control and food intake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within the antipsychotic drug class, Forbes notes that weight gain is linked to antihistamine activity and serotonin 2C antagonism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have seven different types of serotonin receptors,” she said. “Specifically, 2C is where we get that side effect, the antagonism or blockade of that receptor.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. Dronabinol&lt;/h3&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Dronabinol is a synthetic THC used to treat and stimulate appetite in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting as well as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;address anorexia and weight loss in adult HIV/AIDS patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;6. Insulin &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Insulin pushes glucose into cells vs. the bloodstream,” Forbes expounds. “These are not to be confused with meds like Ozempic/Mounjaro/Trulicity, etc., which are not insulins but also injected and refrigerated.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Insulin works by aiding the cellular absorption of glucose. However, when the cells absorb too much glucose, the body converts it into fat, leading to weight gain. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forbes, who also makes &lt;a href="https://yourfavpharmacist.myshopify.com/products/body-ody-body-butter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lip balm and body butter&lt;/a&gt;, has previously &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/17/health/pharmacist-reveals-whats-her-cold-and-flu-medicine-cabinet-must-haves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shared the essential meds&lt;/a&gt; she keeps in her medicine cabinet to combat symptoms during cold and flu season and the surprising &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/20/health/why-your-stool-softener-isnt-helping-you-poop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;way you can repurpose ineffective stool softeners. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr., said the situation was “not unusual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“We have measles outbreaks every year,” he added. Mr. Kennedy &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/rfk-jr-anti-vax.html" title=""&gt;has also said in the past&lt;/a&gt; that immunizations against measles and some other infectious diseases are unnecessary and risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Public health experts said that while it’s true we do have measles cases in the United States every year, the latest outbreak is concerning because of its size, because a child has died and because larger outbreaks like this are becoming more frequent as vaccination rates decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“While we certainly see measles cases from time to time, it’s a rarity that we see an unfolding outbreak of this scale,” said Jason Schwartz, an associate professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health. At least 164 people have been sickened with measles so far this year. That is more than half the number of cases in all of 2024, and higher than the 59 cases documented in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-3cbb8137"&gt;How ‘normal’ are measles outbreaks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, which was considered a landmark public health achievement made possible by the vaccine. Since then, there have been cases every year — typically originating with somebody who traveled abroad to a destination where measles is more common, and brought the virus back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;Cook, along with Lubbock's director of public health, Katherine Wells, said they see no end in sight for the outbreak, which now spans nine counties in Texas, many of which have low vaccination rates. "This outbreak is going to continue to grow," Wells said, declining to forecast how high the final case count could go after a reporter raised the possibility of several hundred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, 116 of the 146 cases are under the age of 18, with 46 being between the ages of 0 and 4. Only five of the 146 were vaccinated with at least one dose of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Messaging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more positive note, Wells reported that the outbreak has seemed to sway some vaccine-hesitant parents to get their children vaccinated. Just yesterday in Lubbock, over 50 children came into the city's clinic for measles vaccines. Eleven of those children had vaccine exemptions, meaning their parents had previously gone through the state process to exempt their child from having to receive routine childhood vaccines to attend school. "Which is a really good sign; that means our message is getting out there," Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far in the outbreak, which erupted in late January, messaging about the disease and the importance of vaccination has exclusively come from state and local authorities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only released &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html"&gt;a brief statement&lt;/a&gt; late Thursday, which was not sent through the agency's press distribution list. It did, however, note that "vaccination remains the best defense against measles infection."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a cabinet meeting Wednesday, US Health Secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded to a question about the outbreak, offering a variety of inaccurate information. Kennedy downplayed the outbreak, falsely claiming that "it's not unusual." But, this is an unusual year for measles in the US. As epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina noted on Bluesky, the number of US measles cases this year has already &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kkjetelina.bsky.social/post/3lj45miduzk2h"&gt;surpassed the total case counts from eight of the previous 15 years&lt;/a&gt;. And it is only February.&lt;/p&gt;

We lost equipment. It was a disaster," Dr Samuel Muhindo, in charge of a clinic in Goma, told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0

year almost 2,890 mpox cases and 180 deaths have been reported in the country, which has been at the epicentre of several recent outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Muhindo described how 128 patients had fled Goma's Mugunga health centre in the wake of the fighting at the end of January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His health workers had not been able to trace them as paperwork at the clinic was destroyed, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At Bisengimana, a hospital in Goma that also treats mpox, looters took medicines and personal protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Fires were lit outside the centre and when the perpetrators departed, patients' medical records were left strewn on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jVHuOl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The situation has been further complicated by the M23's decision to close a network of camps in Goma where tens of thousands of people who had sought refuge from fighting in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They were given &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y98jjwx4no" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;72 hours to leave last week&lt;/a&gt;, although the M23 later said it was encouraging "voluntary returns".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Now we are afraid of an outbreak of the epidemic in the areas where the displaced people returned to," Dr Muhindo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His fears have been echoed by the Africa CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Once again, we are calling really for the ceasefire and also the agency to establish a humanitarian corridor to facilitate the continuation of mpox interventions," Dr Ngashi Ngongo, Africa

two cities that descended into chaos as they were seized by the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels over the past weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We were looted. We lost equipment. It was a disaster," Dr Samuel Muhindo, in charge of a clinic in Goma, told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0

year almost 2,890 mpox cases and 180 deaths have been reported in the country, which has been at the epicentre of several recent outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Muhindo described how 128 patients had fled Goma's Mugunga health centre in the wake of the fighting at the end of January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His health workers had not been able to trace them as paperwork at the clinic was destroyed, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At Bisengimana, a hospital in Goma that also treats mpox, looters took medicines and personal protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Fires were lit outside the centre and when the perpetrators departed, patients' medical records were left strewn on the

fezwLZ"&gt;The situation has been further complicated by the M23's decision to close a network of camps in Goma where tens of thousands of people who had sought refuge from fighting in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They were given &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y98jjwx4no" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;72 hours to leave last week&lt;/a&gt;, although the M23 later said it was encouraging "voluntary returns".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Now we are afraid of an outbreak of the epidemic in the areas where the displaced people returned to," Dr Muhindo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His fears have been echoed by the Africa CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Once again, we are calling really for the ceasefire and also the agency to establish a humanitarian corridor to facilitate the continuation of mpox interventions," Dr Ngashi Ngongo, Africa

It can potentially lead to serious health consequences, including death. It can spread when an infected person breaths, coughs or sneezes or by touching an infected surface, according to&lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/what-to-know-about-measles-and-vaccines#:~:text=A%20measles%20outbreak%20in%20the,may%20only%20become%20more%20common." target="_blank"&gt; John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. The infection is so contagious, the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control &lt;/a&gt;said, you can get measles just by being in a room where the infected person has been — even up to two hours after that person has left the room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx#:~:text=As%20of%20February%2022%2C%202025%2C%20three%E2%80%8B%20confirmed%20measles%20case,provisional%20and%20subject%20to%20change." target="_blank"&gt;three reported cases&lt;/a&gt; of the measles as of Feb. 22; there are 164 cases across the U.S. in states that include Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island and Texas, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest number of cases and the&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-02-26/an-unvaccinated-child-has-died-in-the-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt; first death from the disease since 2015&lt;/a&gt; — an unvaccinated child — have occurred in rural west Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the uptick in cases is caused by an overall &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-02-27/as-measles-cases-mount-in-the-us-whats-the-situation-worldwide"&gt;decline in measles vaccination rates worldwide since the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. The infection is so contagious that at least 95% of a community needs to be immunized to prevent it from spreading. In the U.S. most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergarten-age children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travelers and airport staff who were at Terminal B — which serves flights for Air China, Air France, All Nippon Airways, British Airways and Cathay Pacific Airways, among others — on Feb. 19 between 1 and 4 p.m. may be at risk of developing measles due to possible exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible exposure site includes specific seats on the Korean Airline flight. Potentially exposed passengers can expect to be contacted by their local health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a serious respiratory disease that spreads easily through the air and on surfaces, particularly among people who are not already protected from it,” said Muntu Davis, the Los Angeles County Health Officer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx#:~:text=As%20of%20February%2022%2C%202025%2C%20three%E2%80%8B%20confirmed%20measles%20case,provisional%20and%20subject%20to%20change." target="_blank"&gt;three reported cases&lt;/a&gt; of the measles as of Feb. 22; there are 164 cases across the U.S. in states that include Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island and Texas, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-02-26/an-unvaccinated-child-has-died-in-the-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials advise that you confirm whether you’ve been vaccinated against the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have not had measles in the past and have not yet received the measles vaccine, you are at risk of contracting the disease if you’ve been exposed, according to county public health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were on the flight or at the terminal where the infected traveler passed through you should:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review your immunization and medical records to determine if you’re protected against measles. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact and notify your healthcare provider as soon as possible about a potential exposure if you are pregnant, have a weakened immune system or are unimmunized against the disease. Parents or guardians of infants who were possibly exposed should contact their pediatrician. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor yourself for symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If symptoms develop, stay home and do not enter a healthcare facility before calling first to make them aware of your exposure and symptoms. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-long-would-it-take-for-signs-of-symptoms" class="subhead"&gt;How long would it take for signs of symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A person can spread the illness to others before they have symptoms, and it can take seven to 21 days for symptoms to show up after exposure,” Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposed individuals who have been free of symptoms for more than 21 days are no longer at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-symptoms" class="subhead"&gt;What are symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 7 and 14 days after exposure, your symptoms could include high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, and rash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 7 and 18 days after exposure, you may develop a rash on your face and upper neck. The rash can spread to your hands and feet over the course of three days. Health officials say the rash lasts between five and six days before fading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection can result in severe complications, including blindness, encephalitis (an infection causing brain swelling and potentially brain damage), severe diarrhea and related dehydration, ear infections, trouble breathing due to pneumonia and, in some cases, death, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles can lead to severe disease in young children and vulnerable adults,” Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s common for complications to occur in children under 5 and adults over the age of 30, according to public health experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-protect-yourself-against-the-measles" class="subhead"&gt;How to protect yourself against the measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the best way to protect against the measles is with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93% effective. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;The CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; getting the first dose of the MMR vaccine at ages 12 to 15 months and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 20:30:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wFBVV95cUxNVlFfLU8wRmYycktVeVZUN0hoeWo4QmxiR2Z0azg2bXViR2FheW1TRkpxTDBpMmZuWGJrNldlc0lJOVo3emUwMUlWX2tIdXRZM29SWTR4U0UxdW9aSldKTGoxaVRnUnJnV1NYR2hnLWV0YU1Nc3laay1PV0Z3MUdMTzhwamdKc0U2c3BLZVlfVXFQUXU2U001ek9JR25vSXd5Y251elIyRkUtb3E1bGc2bnVUblRvR0pJVW9lZ0RJUWtwaVhGMjQtLTduWDBHWWl2MXdF</guid></item><item><title>N.J. cat euthanized after bird flu infection.

Now there are growing worries about next year’s flu vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, the Food and Drug Administration — now with vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the helm — unexpectedly and without reason canceled a March meeting of scientists who advise the FDA on vaccine policy. A similar meeting at the Centers for Disease Control was postponed last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, the head of the University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, joined Morning Edition host Cathy Wurzer to talk about the implications of axing the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_timelines_for_flu_vaccines_are_tight._why_do_cancellations_of_these_march_meetings_matter%3F_"&gt;Timelines for flu vaccines are tight. Why do cancellations of these March meetings matter? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes about six months for the virus that scientists use for the vaccine to grow. It’s then available in late summer or early fall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="donate-ask undefined"&gt;&lt;div class="donate-ask-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;MPR News helps you turn down the noise and build shared understanding. Turn up your support for this public resource and keep trusted journalism accessible to all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like planting a garden,” Osterholm said. “If you postpone it two months, you might be in trouble when you can harvest, and if you can harvest it at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timeline is already tight to make an educated estimation on what flu strains will be a problem next year, and the virus can change between now and then. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But this is our best guess and our best attempt to give us the best match for the virus circulating next winter and what’s in the vaccine,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_since_the_vaccine_is_often_grown_in_chicken_eggs%2C_could_bird_flu_affect_development%3F_"&gt;Since the vaccine is often grown in chicken eggs, could bird flu affect development? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is no. And Osterholm said this is some good news among the bad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Right after 9/11, when we had so many concerns about terrorism and so forth happening, the U.S. government took extra effort, along with the vaccine manufacturers, to secure the facilities where these chickens actually lay the eggs,” Osterholm said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eggs used by scientists are embryonated, meaning they’re fertilized and growing a fetal chicken. The chickens are raised under tight biosecurity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The buildings are airtight with special filters,” Osterholm explained. “And so we feel pretty confident that even if a H5N1 situation is occurring in the region where these egg-producing locations are at, we’re still in really good shape.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_can_the_vaccines_be_manufactured_without_fda_or_cdc_panel_guidance%3F_"&gt;Can the vaccines be manufactured without FDA or CDC panel guidance? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panels evaluate what’s been happening with the flu in the southern hemisphere. The strains circulating there typically predict what’s likely to happen in the U.S. four to five months later, according to Osterholm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And without those kind of data, we can’t do that,” he said. “It’s not just something casually done saying, ‘Ah, let’s just go with that one, OK?’ Now there really is a major effort made to come up with the closest match we can. So this timing and the meetings themselves are very, very important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_if_the_federal_government_scales_back_mass_vaccination%2C_how_could_people_still_get_shots%3F_"&gt;If the federal government scales back mass vaccination, how could people still get shots? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this point, we are really in the worst place I’ve been in my 50-year career in terms of vaccine preventable diseases,” Osterholm said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several state governments, in line with Kennedy, are increasingly identifying as anti-vaccine. For example, the Surgeon General of Louisiana recently issued a statement saying the state department of health no longer supports vaccine campaigns for children — and for parents that want them, to seek immunizations out independently. In Texas and New Mexico, there’s a worsening outbreak of measles, which the U.S. declared eliminated back in 2000. However, dropping rates of MMR vaccines for kids are bringing the disease out of the shadows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And so there is this ever-creeping concern coming into the vaccine picture of people who are not getting vaccinated,” Osterholm continued. “We have a real battle on our hands right now in terms of helping the public understand what will happen if they’re not vaccinating their kids. What this means is this is not without a consequence. So you may think you’re making a moral choice. We're also making a choice that can end up killing your child.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osterholm also pointed out that federal governments in the past have been a leader in the discussion, calling it “unfortunate” that it’s not the present case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_can_states_continue_vaccine_programs_if_the_federal_government_stops_dispersing_shots%3F_"&gt;Can states continue vaccine programs if the federal government stops dispersing shots? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ meeting was canceled recently. When the group makes a recommendation on vaccines, it’s affirmed by the CDC and triggers a sequence of events, including covering child vaccination programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without that, you basically don’t have a mechanism for paying for these vaccines, and so it’s a much larger issue than just telling parents that this is a good thing to do,” Osterholm explained. “It also makes the wheels of public health turn.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many state and local health departments in the U.S. have immunization programs largely supported by federal dollars. Osterholm is concerned that there’ll be a mass reduction in these programs under the Trump Administration. He also expects hefty layoffs at the CDC in the coming weeks, which will directly impact local health programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The whole system right now is devolving into, frankly, a black hole,” he said. “I am incredibly, incredibly concerned that we’re going to see a major erosion in [vaccination] for children in this country over the next year or two, and it will absolutely result in major outbreaks.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_are_you_worried_about_pandemic_readiness%2C_should_one_occur%3F_"&gt;Are you worried about pandemic readiness, should one occur? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone has to understand the pandemic clock is ticking. We just don’t know what time it is,” Osterholm warned, underlining there will be more pandemics — and they could be worse than COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Are we prepared for this? Absolutely not,” he said. “We have so many lessons that should have and could have been learned from what we went through with COVID that no one really ever took the time in federal governments or organizations to really review that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I fear that we’re going to go into the next pandemic… not any better prepared,” Osterholm continued. “But more importantly, we have a public now that distrusts public health unlike any time in modern history.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MPR News</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNdHBwU2lTelRBODBjcG1hTUV4UXljbmJlVWE1WWtfaXBaT2VJM2FzTTV0cnJnRmNvNmZULXg0bzNxOFp6M2Jkel8xNS1UcmhySnN0NDhZU1lQRTJtMVlpblZPckFNeHJ3Rjh5WUc5dzIwbzI3RjMwQi1VR2Z5WDJBSWNPR2xLTnFQSUVFMC15U25SWklTMkFoV05nM2N4VUhQS1dWSEZoVml2VzNISzZlTjN6bw</guid></item><item><title>In Texas Measles Outbreak, Signs of a Riskier Future for Children - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE0zOG9aemVMeTRpcmtkVjFtQzFTZlJDbm1GU2RhZ19uX29YWFcwZVhQVHVtWmo3bUZoZkdqeG1BcE5xTWh2NUpXR29rTnZoMllucWlXcmJPRjNZSTZUbnE0WTNqLUwxTnRUMGRjd05DYURNa2pLcHRv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Every day, as Dr. Wendell Parkey enters his clinic in Seminole, a small city on the rural western edge of Texas, he announces his arrival to the staff with an anthem pumping loudly through speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As the song reaches a climax, he throws up an arm and strikes a pose in cowboy boots. “Y’all ready to stomp out disease?” he asks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Recently, the question has taken on a dark urgency. Seminole Memorial Hospital, where Dr. Parkey has practiced for nearly three decades, has found itself at the center of the largest measles outbreak in the United States since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Since last month, more than 140 Texas residents, most of whom live in the surrounding Gaines County, have been diagnosed and 20 have been hospitalized.

            Two long-planned vaccine meetings — one at the US Centers for Disease Control and another at the US Food and Drug Administration — have now been disrupted under the watch of US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., stirring questions about whether seasonal flu shots or other lifesaving vaccines will be delayed or harder to access.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9dv9x000m3b6mgnj45ezk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The February meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, was postponed “to accommodate public comment,” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to a note&lt;/a&gt; online. The three-day meeting,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which had been scheduled for this week, was to review the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for meningococcal disease, which is seeing a resurgence, as well as RSV, flu, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/chikungunya-vaccine-cdc-investigating-hospitalizations/index.html"&gt;chikungunya&lt;/a&gt; and mpox. It also &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/agenda-2025-02-26-28-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;included two votes&lt;/a&gt; related to Vaccines for Children, the government program that buys and distributes vaccines to state and local health departments for children whose families wouldn’t otherwise be able to pay for them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9g3q1000r3b6m9h2mll6n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ACIP typically meets three times a year, in February, June and October. There’s no word on whether or when the February meeting will be rescheduled and it’s unclear whether the delay will hinder access to shots.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o6vzxd00093b6mby8kqx71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Wednesday, the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/news-fda-meeting-to-choose-flu-vaccine-composition-canceled-without-explanation/index.html"&gt;FDA canceled&lt;/a&gt; a March 13 meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which was to discuss the recipe manufacturers must follow to make this fall’s flu shots. No explanation was given for the cancellation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9c0kl000g3b6m88ej5gxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a statement to CNN on Thursday, the FDA said it would still weigh in on the makeup of flu shots but didn’t indicate whether it would seek its advisers’ guidance or allow for the public discussion and debate that usually occurs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9i2up000t3b6m6cy8pdob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,” the statement said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x00022e6blfkv1l3q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The uncertainty around the government’s process for regulating and recommending vaccines comes as the US is in the grips of a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/health/flu-season-hospitalizations-mrsa-ane/index.html"&gt;brutal flu season&lt;/a&gt; and experiencing a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/texas-measles-death/index.html"&gt;resurgence of measles&lt;/a&gt;, a vaccine preventable disease. Experts say these infections are increasing because of growing hesitancy to use vaccines, something they fear the new HHS director will only encourage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x00032e6bfequg2s6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy maintains that he is not anti-vaccine, but he has repeatedly cast doubt on the safety and effectiveness of immunizations and questioned the research and regulations that allow them to be used.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9rh0r00193b6mpfw0oa50@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, whose financial disclosures show he has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/22/politics/rfk-jr-financial-interest-wisner-baum-lawsuits/index.html"&gt;made money from law firms &lt;/a&gt;that sue vaccine manufacturers, has also impugned some of the experts who advise federal agencies on vaccines. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;incorrectly&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;stated that 97% of the members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee had conflicts of interest. In fact, the panel has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/ACIP-conflicts-interest-policy.pdf#:~:text=A%20conflict%20of%20interest%20exists%20when%20a,that%20vaccine%2C%20or%20of%20a%20competing%20vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;strict policies&lt;/a&gt; to guard against conflicts, and a screening process for members to ensure they are impartial when they vote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9e4ip000p3b6m3niaazty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Members of FDA’s vaccine committee are also subject to strict conflict of interest rules and are required to disclose potential conflicts during meetings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9l5qv00153b6mzkhhkw33@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This week, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tom-frieden_among-the-many-myths-circulating-about-vaccines-activity-7300602853784465408-t0Db?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;amp;rcm=ACoAAACwoZkBElUwSIV2Ynw-2W8V_lyGmfKbibE" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that false claims that ACIP members vote based on their financial ties is among the “most damaging” falsehoods about vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7okus6400002e6bmdqbu9fj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Frieden said the 97% figure comes from a 2009 report, issued when he was CDC director. He is now president and CEO of the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ovctto00052e6bwvkbo7by@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was an audit of lengthy and detailed conflict of interest forms submitted by all experts who served as CDC advisers in 2007. He said 97% had at least one missing response, which could have meant someone forgot to do something as simple as initial a page. He said it is not the same thing as a conflict of interest.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oq2cj600002e6bi66kgqde@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I really think that this is classic misinformation,” Frieden told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oa48fa001j3b6mr2uzbalz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Frieden also raised alarm about the postponed ACIP meeting, writing in &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tom-frieden_making-america-healthier-the-administration-activity-7298578744196141057-Bz1y/" target="_blank"&gt;a recent post on LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, “It’s certain there will be misleading, inaccurate information claiming ACIP members have conflicts of interest. Here’s the plain truth: ACIP, made up of pediatricians, public health specialists, and parents, is the gold standard for open, transparent recommendations on vaccine safety and effectiveness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oaj58x00253b6myoy9fi3x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Without either vaccine committee weighing in on vaccine regulation or recommendations, health-care providers worry there will be delays on vaccines or limits on people’s ability to access them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oannto002c3b6mp0en084w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Cancelling this meeting means vaccine makers may not have the vital information and time they need to produce and distribute targeted vaccines before the next flu season,” Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said after the cancellation of the FDA flu shot meeting. “If the FDA meeting is not immediately rescheduled, many lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oapzw4002g3b6m05q39ik4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a February 20 &lt;a href="https://www.fightinfectiousdisease.org/post/sign-on-letter-to-preserve-acip-meeting" target="_blank"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to Kennedy, Acting CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and Sen. Bill Cassidy&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a doctor and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, a coalition of groups called the Partnership to Fight Infectious Disease pushed for the “prompt rescheduling” of the ACIP meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oaqr8a002j3b6mr5r0ws92@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Each ACIP meeting holds tremendous weight and relevance. Infectious diseases are constantly evolving opponents; vaccines are among the best tools for constantly adapting and responding to the latest public health threats,” the letter said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oatn1c002m3b6m6ev1xsu9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Making America healthy requires healthy discussion and timely, evidence-based decisions. This meeting should be no different.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7obgbkx00003b6m2vzyutro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are several different ways to make flu vaccines, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccine-process/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the most common&lt;/a&gt; is to grow the selected candidate viruses in chicken eggs — a painstaking operation that takes months to finish.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7obquud00053b6miceo530q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For that reason, selection of the strains that will be included in flu vaccines is carefully orchestrated to be sure that manufacturers can deliver their shots to doctor’s offices and pharmacies in time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000h2e6bjt3hjy0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In order for flu vaccines to be sold in the US, they must contain strains that are officially selected by the FDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ob4uk700353b6m2xice34r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That decision typically comes after a meeting of the World Health Organization’s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/global-influenza-surveillance-and-response-system/who-collaboration-center-erl" target="_blank"&gt;a network of&lt;/a&gt; seven collaborating centers and four essential regulatory labs, which are based in the US, UK, Japan, China, Russia and Australia. Both the CDC and FDA are members, and representatives from both agencies participated in the deliberations which got underway this week, WHO said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7p106fn00002e6b0eadc0mj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The US did participate in this meeting,” Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead for Covid-19, said at a news briefing on Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7p15i5h00042e6bzagg9e08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I want to be very clear that the US is still contributing. I know that there’s a lot of attention on the US right now, but we are going to continue to emphasize the importance of this global system that’s in place.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ob6bhl003b3b6m1wfoqpnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These experts meet twice a year — in the fall and spring — to choose strains for countries in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ozk1va00002e6bqx3oepz6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/28-02-2025-recommendations-announced-for-influenza-vaccine-composition-for-the-2025-2026-northern-hemisphere-influenza-season" target="_blank"&gt;WHO announced&lt;/a&gt; the strains that it thinks will most closely match the viruses that will be making people sick next fall. Those picks would swap out the H3N2 component of this years vaccine, which was only a partial match to the circulating viruses, for a new one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7p0cyop00002e6bk7nr2ova@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think the match is not perfect, but it is a reasonable match, and is still the best preventative we have against infection with influenza,” said Prof. Ian Barr, deputy director at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, and a member of GISRS, in a new briefing after the strain selection
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000n2e6b1icp9h1u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What typically happens next is that the 17-member FDA vaccine committee would meet and publicly discuss the recommendation, and then make its own endorsement.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The agency ultimately makes the final decision, which can differ from its advisers’, although they generally align.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000o2e6bnmg35uqj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This year, there won’t be an advisory meeting. The FDA said it would still make recommendations to manufacturers but didn’t specify how it would come to a decision or when.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000p2e6bydwabril@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If there’s no FDA recommended strains, the US manufacturers are kind of stuck,” said Dr. LJ Tan who is chief policy and partnerships officer for nonprofit vaccine advocacy group Immunize.org.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oaxfrs002u3b6mhjkt7n5l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu vaccine manufacturers contacted by CNN on Thursday said the missed VRBPAC meeting wouldn’t break their stride.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ob47e5002z3b6mv1o2ogb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Just as every year, we have already begun production for the 2025-2026 flu season in the Northern Hemisphere and will be ready to support final strain selections in time for the season,” wrote Sanofi in a statement to CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ob4hh300323b6mp6w3rcb2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GSK also said it will continue to work with FDA on its flu strain recommendation in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000r2e6bsaioq01t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But canceling the VRBPAC meeting will deprive Americans of public discussion and debate that happens when these experts meet. It makes the process less transparent, Immunize.org’s Tan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000s2e6blbojg9gq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s very dangerous to bypass your expert advisory committee,” Tan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oltkbi00032e6bpr42aqat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In his Senate confirmation hearings, Kennedy promised “radical transparency” at HHS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7onjm6a00092e6br3a5wwbd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Public health agencies should be transparent and if we want Americans to restore trust in the public health agencies, we need transparency,” Kennedy said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7onluyi000c2e6bstf5zl5k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine advocates say canceling advisory committee meetings undermines that goal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000u2e6bprmnc1ch@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You heard what we thought. We disagreed on some things, and for people who are interested, you can see how we arrived at the conclusion that we did,” said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a member of FDA’s VRBPAC who is also a pediatrician and immunologist at the University of Iowa.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7onwp14000j2e6bmwfd8smv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Perlman said he was also worried that skipping committee meetings would deprive the public of a window into the government’s vaccine decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000v2e6blxl5qrew@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The country is in so much flux right now about what it thinks about vaccines, what it thinks about medical devices, what it thinks about drugs. The more transparency there is, hopefully, the more people who are undecided about things will see where the committee is coming from,” Perlman told CNN’s Meg Tirrell.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000w2e6b6t6ongm8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other experts agreed the committees are an important layer of independent review.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000x2e6b7xpjicrn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s kind of taking experts out of the conversation,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician who directs of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Many of these decisions are tricky and nuanced, and having the opportunity for a group of experts who are familiar with these vaccines and familiar with these diseases. You know, have an open discussion is critically important.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000y2e6bz18352nq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FDA has not said how it will choose vaccine strains for the fall, but if it follows WHO’s recommendation, it will mean that the US will be relying on data from the organization despite President Donald Trump’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" target="_blank"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; that the US withdraw its support from WHO and stop sharing information.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It’s part of the chaos, whether it’s planned or not, or just incompetence,” Moss said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o74ekc00002e6bmzc82wgg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study will trial the use of double immunotherapy. In some patients, double immunotherapy will be combined with chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial will be led by The Brain Cancer Centre, which has world-leading expertise in glioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted to be handing the baton to &lt;a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/researcher/jim-whittle/"&gt;Dr Jim Whittle&lt;/a&gt;, a leading Australian neuro-oncologist at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Co-Head of Research Strategy at The Brain Cancer Centre, to commence a broader scientific study to scientifically determine if – and how – this process might work in treating glioblastoma,” said Prof Long, who also secured drug access for the clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While we are buoyed by the results of this experimental treatment so far, a clinical trial in a large group of patients would need to happen before anyone could consider it a possible breakthrough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Whittle, also a laboratory head at WEHI, said: “We are pleased to be able to build on this exciting work by diving into the process of designing a clinical trial, which takes time, care and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When that process is complete, the result will be a world first clinical trial that enables us to thoroughly test the hypothesis against a representative sample of patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brain Cancer Centre was founded by Carrie’s Beanies 4 Brain Cancer and established in partnership with WEHI with support from the Victorian Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centre brings together a growing network of world-leading oncologists, immunologists, neurosurgeons, bioinformaticians and cancer biologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commencement of recruitment for the clinical trial will be announced by The Brain Cancer Centre at a later date and will be limited to eligible patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have a new target to prevent cold sores after University of Virginia School of Medicine researchers discovered an unexpected way the herpes virus re-activates in the body. The finding could also have important implications for genital herpes caused by the same virus.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The discovery from UVA's Anna Cliffe, Ph.D., and colleagues seems to defy common sense. She and her team found that the slumbering herpes virus will make a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/protein/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; to trigger the body's immune response as part of its escape from dormancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'd think this would be bad for the virus—that activating the body's antiviral defenses would be like poking a bear. But, instead, it's the opposite: The virus highjacks the antiviral process in infected neurons (nerve cells) to make the type of comeback nobody wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings identify the first viral protein required for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/herpes+simplex+virus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;herpes simplex virus&lt;/a&gt; to wake up from dormancy, and, surprisingly, this protein does so by triggering responses that should act against the virus," said Cliffe of UVA's Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cancer Biology. "This is important because it gives us new ways to potentially prevent the virus from waking up and activating immune responses in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nervous+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nervous system&lt;/a&gt; that could have negative consequences in the long term."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2413965122" target="_blank"&gt;published their findings&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Understanding herpes simplex virus-associated disease&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cold sores are caused primarily by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), one of two forms of the herpes virus. HSV-1 is very contagious, and more than 60% of people under 50 have been infected worldwide, the World Health Organization estimates. That's more than 3.8 billion people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to causing cold sores, herpes simplex virus 1 can also cause genital herpes, a condition most often associated with HSV-1's cousin, herpes simplex virus 2. Now, however, there are more new cases of genital herpes in the United States caused by HSV-1 than HSV-2. Notably, the UVA researchers found that herpes simplex virus 2 also makes this same protein and may use a similar mechanism to reactivate. So UVA's new discovery may also lead to new treatments for genital herpes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to cold sores and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genital+herpes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genital herpes&lt;/a&gt;, HSV-1 can also cause viral encephalitis (brain inflammation) and has been linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once HSV-1 makes its way into our bodies, it stays forever. Our immune systems can send it into hiding, allowing infected people to be symptom-free. But stress, other infections and even sunburns are known to cause it to flare. UVA's new discovery adds another, surprising way it can spring back into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that while the virus can make a protein called UL12.5 to reactivate, the protein was not needed in the presence of another infection. The scientists believe this is because the infections trigger certain "sensing pathways" that act as the home security system for neurons. Detection of a pathogen alone may be sufficient to trigger the herpes virus to begin replicating, the scientists believe, even in instances of "abortive infections"—when the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; contains the new pathogen before it can replicate.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"We were surprised to find that HSV-1 doesn't just passively wait for the right conditions to reactivate—it actively senses danger and takes control of the process," researcher Patryk Krakowiak said. "Our findings suggest that the virus may be using immune signals as a way to detect cellular stress—whether from neuron damage, infections or other threats—as a cue to escape its host and find a new one."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new understanding of how herpes flares can be triggered, scientists may be able to target the protein to prevent them, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are now following up on this work to investigate how the virus is hijacking this response and testing inhibitors of UL12.5 function," Cliffe said. "Currently, there are no therapies that can prevent the virus from waking up from dormancy, and this stage was thought to only use host proteins. Developing therapies that specifically act on a viral protein is an attractive approach that will likely have fewer side effects than targeting a host protein."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team consisted of Krakowiak, Sean R. Cuddy, Matthew E. Flores, Abigail L. Whitford, Sara A. Dochnal, Aleksandra Babnis, Tsuyoshi Miyake, Marco Tigano, Daniel A. Engel and Cliffe. The scientists have no financial interest in the work.&lt;/p&gt;

and the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new report, Greek doctors detailed another case in Athens involving a gay man who attended an STI clinic with an itchy rash on his buttocks, abdomen and armpit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sharing the tale in a medical journal, they said the 36-year-old tested positive for TMVII but even with treatment only 'showed a gradual but slow improvement'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cases of the contagious infection dubbed a 'potential public health threat' have been on the rise in recent years, with it now being found in people after sexual contact&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a new report, Greek doctors detailed another case in Athens involving a man who had had sex with his male partner and attended hospital with an itchy rash on his buttock, abdomen and armpit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes just months after &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14043235/untreatable-genital-super-fungus-France-spreading-Britain.html"&gt;experts told this website&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;span&gt;the condition, which often causes painful rashes, was 'very likely' to be spreading undetected in Britain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lab tests to confirm cases of the 'slow growing bug' can take up to three weeks for results to come back, they warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition itself can lurk in the body for days before causing tell-tale symptoms, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Describing the new case, medics at Andreas Syngros Hospital of Venereal and Dermatological Diseases, said the patient had ring-shaped lesions on the skin and small, pus-filled, inflamed bumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similar lesions had recently appeared on his partner, he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors carried out tests for syphilis as well as a fungal culture, the latter of which confirmed the presence of TMVII. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/advance-article/doi/10.1093/qjmed/hcaf049/8015625?login=true"&gt;QJM: An International Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the medics said: 'T&lt;span&gt;he patient was further questioned about his recent travel history or contact with domestic animals and revealed that his partner had traveled to North Africa one month prior to the appearance of the rash.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It comes as US health officials in June confirmed one man in New York had become the first ever to contract the infection via sex in the US. Pictured, patient A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He was prescribed terbinafine and flutrimazole, antifungal medications typically used to treat fungal nail infections and ringworm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, a follow-up appointment three weeks later his skin showed 'no improvement' and he was switched to powerful antifungal medication itraconazole. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The patient was subsequently re-evaluated every two weeks showing gradual but slow improvement,' doctors said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After six weeks of treatment, the rash had cleared. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Physicians should remain vigilant in recognising and reporting cases of this emerging pathogen,' they added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;TMVII is hypothesized to be transmitted from human-to-human through sexual contact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Evidence supporting this transmission mode includes the typical localisation of the initial lesions in the genital or gluteal areas, and the higher incidence of cases among groups engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors, such as men who have sex with men.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Then in November, US health officials also reported that a further three cases had been detected in the city. Pictured, patient B &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then in November, US health officials also reported that a further three cases had been detected in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as US health officials in June confirmed one man in New York had become the first ever to contract the infection via sex in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He previously travelled to England, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/greece/index.html" id="mol-f6f8f4b0-f5d3-11ef-bdc6-fd5222969046"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-8f4154b0-f5d4-11ef-bdc6-fd5222969046" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, and said he had sexual encounters during his trips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While not fatal, TMVII can leave sufferers with permanent scarring or pigmentation on areas of the skin that were infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The New York researchers warned the rashes experienced by people infected with this type of ringworm may also present differently than the more common ringworm and could be mistaken for eczema, leaving patients without relief for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr David Denning, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Manchester, told MailOnline it was 'very likely that there are undetected cases' in the UK, 'particularly those in the early stages'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Today if you had a rash on your chest or your back, you might not bother to deal with it for a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you were to go to a doctor and they prescribe something like a steroid or antibacterial cream but it doesn't work, we could be looking at six to eight weeks since it began. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'It's likely no more transmissable than other skin fungi but it is very inflammatory meaning you get a much worse rash and usual treatments don't work.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts also cautioned 'very long waiting lists' for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-8f3ac500-f5d4-11ef-bdc6-fd5222969046" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; dermatology treatment and 'long waits' for PCR test results could see at risk patients waiting weeks before the infection is confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — The Texas Department of Health and Human Services has released the latest number of measles cases confirmed as the state continues to battle an outbreak in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest update comes two days after the &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles/texas-measles-death-outbreak-lubbock/285-636380ac-1d18-4404-999d-b804f40137af" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;first death was reported&lt;/a&gt; in a school-aged child who lived in the outbreak area. Officials said the child was not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak has been the largest in the state in &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-mmr-vaccine-homeschooling-b29d08d53cf26704968e8c00dfa712ba"&gt;nearly 30 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state and Lubbock health officials confirmed the death to The Associated Press. The child wasn't identified but was treated at Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock, though the facility noted the patient didn't live in Lubbock County.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a big deal,” Dr. Amy Thompson, a pediatrician and chief executive officer of Covenant Health, said Wednesday at a news conference. “We have known that we have measles in our community, and we are now seeing a very serious consequence.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In federal response, RFK Jr. appears to misstate several facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s top health official and a vaccine critic, said Wednesday that the U.S. Department of the Health and Human Services is watching cases and dismissed the Texas outbreak as “not unusual.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He appeared to misstate a number of facts, including a claim that most who had been hospitalized were there only for “quarantine.” Dr. Lara Johnson at Covenant contested that characterization.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t hospitalize patients for quarantine purposes,” said Johnson, the chief medical officer.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also seemed to misspeak in saying two people had died of measles. A spokesman — Andrew Nixon, for the Department of Health and Human Services — later clarified that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified only one death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government is providing vaccines as well as technical and laboratory support in West Texas, but the state health department is leading the response, Nixon said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC has said it will provide only weekly updates on the measles outbreak, and had not yet updated its public webpage to reflect the child’s death. Texas health department data shows that a majority of the reported measles cases are in children.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In rural Texas, some patients have needed oxygen or intubation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus has largely spread among rural, oil rig-dotted towns in West Texas, with cases concentrated in a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-vaccinations-mennonites-4880035d6fd53cc029b531f5adda95ad"&gt;“close-knit, undervaccinated” Mennonite community&lt;/a&gt;, state health department spokesperson Lara Anton said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaines County, which has reported 80 cases so far, has a strong homeschooling and private school community. It is also home to one of the highest rates of school-aged children in Texas who have opted out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% skipping a required dose last school year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20 measles patients have been hospitalized at Covenant, including the outbreak's first identified case, hospital officials said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some patients' respiratory issues progressed to bacterial pneumonia, and they needed an oxygen tube to breathe, Johnson told The Associated Press. Others had to be intubated, though Johnson declined to say how many due to privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, like so many viruses, there aren’t any specific treatments for measles,” she said. “What we’re doing is providing supportive care, helping support the patients as they hopefully recover.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said through a spokesman that his office is in regular communication with the state health department and epidemiologists, and that vaccination teams are in the “affected area.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The state will deploy all necessary resources to ensure the safety and health of Texans,” said spokesman Andrew Mahaleris, calling the child's death a tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later Wednesday, the state health department confirmed a new measles case in Rockwall County, east of Dallas. The person had traveled internationally and is not related to the West Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccines are safe and effective, and measles was once considered eliminated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing infection and severe cases. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccinations-kindergarten-exemptions-cdc-1c0f9a196a70491fccf48b9125090de0"&gt;95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners&lt;/a&gt; — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/childhood-vaccines-schedule-kennedy-trump-hhs-4d5e6c52c602f5edbcd837748605e9d0"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; vowed to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule that prevents measles, polio and other dangerous diseases, despite promises not to change it during his confirmation hearings.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. had considered measles — a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours — eliminated in 2000, which meant there had been a halt in continuous spread of the disease for at least a year. Measles cases rose in 2024, including a Chicago outbreak that &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-chicago-migrant-shelter-cdc-e58517c830f73e42266d45d45983c12b"&gt;sickened more than 60&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current outbreak, Lubbock’s first case was in an unvaccinated child who sat in an emergency room with a kid who had measles, said Katherine Wells, director of the local health department, calling it a testament to how quickly the virus spreads.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you see it in real life, you really realize how contagious it is,” said Wells, noting she expects more local cases, with a couple under investigation as of Wednesday. “An entire household gets sick so quickly. Whole families are getting sick with measles.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s almost March! Which means voting for our annual STAT Madness competition starts Monday. I will see you in the brackets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-administration-mum-amid-deadly-measles-outbreak"&gt;Trump administration mum amid deadly measles outbreak&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When measles struck New York in 2018 and 2019, federal health officials uniformly preached the power of immunizations. President Trump, himself, implored people to get the shot. But several years later, public messaging has dramatically changed, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/27/trump-administration-measles-outbreak-response-breaks-with-past/"&gt;writes STAT’s Andrew Joseph&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, a reporter asked Trump about the rapidly growing outbreak centered in Texas — over 124 confirmed cases, including the country’s first measles death in a decade in an unvaccinated child. Trump passed the question to his health secretary, and longtime vaccine critic, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who downplayed the outbreak and misstated the death toll. The lack of messaging from the executive branch is an early sign that Trump’s embrace of prominent anti-vaccine critics like RFK Jr. could usher in a period of greater skepticism of basic public health tenets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What I’m struck by is the near total silence from [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] in communicating about this outbreak, talking about the importance of vaccination, providing its own perspective and voice on the outbreak,” said Jason Schwartz, an expert on vaccine policy at the Yale School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Late Thursday, the CDC quietly released a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the outbreak, burying it on its website instead of sending an email to reporters. While it emphasized that “vaccination remains the best defense against measles infection,” the statement lacked the full-throated defense of vaccines present in prior administrations. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/27/trump-administration-measles-outbreak-response-breaks-with-past/" rel=""&gt;Read more from Drew’s excellent story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-positive-results-from-flu-covid-hpv-vaccines"&gt;Positive results from flu, covid, HPV vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some rare good news from the Department of Stuff We Wish We Had More Time To Write About. There were three vaccines-related studies in this week’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, published Thursday by the CDC. Two were vaccine effectiveness studies that estimate the differences in outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An early estimate of the effectiveness of this year’s Covid shot showed its effectiveness in preventing hospitalization for the illness was about 45% in healthy older adults and 40% in those who were immunocompromised.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Likewise, influenza vaccines offered additional protection at all age levels in one of the worst flu seasons in years, early estimates of vaccine effectiveness or VE demonstrated. All age groups were less likely to need outpatient medical care or hospitalization if they were vaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A study looking at the impact of the human papillomavirus or HPV vaccine showed that in the period from 2008 to 2022, the incidence of cervical precancers declined 79% and the rate of higher grade precancers declined 80% in women aged 20 to 24, the age group most likely to be vaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nih-cancels-summer-internship-program"&gt;NIH cancels summer internship program&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health usually welcomes around 1,200 students onto its campuses each summer, but this year will be an exception. In an internal email obtained by STAT, the agency announced that it is cancelling its Summer Internship Program, also known as SIP, even though some students had already been accepted. The program has for years given students interested in research careers hands-on experience and career counseling, including interns from groups underrepresented in science.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency did not provide an explanation for the move, but it comes at a time when NIH has also stopped recruiting postdoctoral researchers; Ph.D. students; and postbacs, who are recent college graduates. “This was a challenging decision, and I know some of you will disagree with us; however, we are following the path we feel is best for the students and this institution,” wrote Sharon Milgram, director of the agency’s Office of Intramural Training and Education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-we-talk-about-mental-health-at-work"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we talk about mental health at work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s down to support a colleague in crisis, but nobody wants to dish on their own mental health troubles at work, according to a new poll from the National Association of Mental Illness and Ipsos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People want mental health support in the workplace, but nearly half of the 2,376 adults surveyed worry that their careers would suffer or that they would be judged if they talked with their colleagues about their mental health. The stakes remain high, even if the stigma tamps down conversation surrounding mental illness: a similar poll in 2024 found high rates of burnout among women, young workers and mid-level employees. &lt;a href="https://www.nami.org/support-education/publications-reports/survey-reports/the-2025-nami-workplace-mental-health-poll/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the poll here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January, an X user &lt;a href="https://x.com/AJKayWriter/status/1878084198205907173" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about how Grok, X’s artificial intelligence tool, diagnosed their daughter’s broken wrist from an X-ray. Elon Musk shouted-out the post, &lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1878203372513136854" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;declaring&lt;/a&gt;, “Grok can diagnose medical injuries.” While large-language model tools like Grok have potential, their efficacy pales in comparison to radiologists, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/28/grok-ai-human-fracture-radiology-vision-llms/"&gt;writes Kalyan Sivasailam, the co-founder and CEO of 5C Network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sivasailam and his colleagues tested Grok and other LLMs by showing them 10 X-ray images of fractures. The technologies struggled to identify breaks or only partially identified others. For these technologies to improve, they need to boost their high-resolution image processing and more training on large datasets of medical images, curated by radiologists. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/28/grok-ai-human-fracture-radiology-vision-llms/" rel=""&gt;Read on&lt;/a&gt; for more information about why “general purpose vision LLMs are great… for general purpose tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Akiko Iwasaki, the lead researcher behind the paper, told MailOnline she understands the pre-print, which was not peer-reviewed but published on website MedRxiv, could be seen as controversial &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One told MailOnline they had developed persistent tinnitus six-hours after their third Covid jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I spent over 12 months on an NHS audiology waiting list, only to be dismissed and told it was merely a coincidence due to my part-time work as a sound engineer,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added how the constant tinnitus, which can take the form of ringing, buzzing or hissing, now dominated his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I struggle with sleep, frequently need to ask people to repeat themselves, and find that the only way I can concentrate at work is by constantly listening to music to drown out the incessant noise,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many who contacted this website he said he had felt 'coerced' into getting the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If I didn't get them, I would have been fired, as there was no place for me in the small office with non-existent social distancing. Being a new starter, I felt I had no choice but to comply,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of the patients who suspect they have PVS told MailOnline directly that were not against vaccines in general, noting that they have saved countless lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2022 study led by academics at Imperial College London suggests almost 20million lives were saved by Covid vaccines in the first year since countries began rolling out the jabs, the majority in wealthy nations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they added that a general failure from experts to acknowledge their experiences of adverse reactions had eroded trust in the health system, an attitude that could put the success of future vaccine programmes at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PVS is still a poorly understood condition, with even the Yale experts who unveiled their findings emphasizing the research is 'still a work in progress'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, the team collected blood samples of 42 Americans with PVS and 22 without it, between December 2022 and November 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with the syndrome were generally in poorer health than the average American, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most complaining of the symptoms developed them after their first or second Covid vaccine, with some experiencing an onset after a third or fourth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with PVS also had elevated levels of Covid spike proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The levels in PVS patients were even greater than those found in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14255465/doctors-relief-long-covid-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;patients with long Covid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a condition with similar symptoms linked to the virus itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It should also be noted that many of the PVS's symptoms are relatively common ailments and can be caused by numerous conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As such, there is currently no way to prove if they are caused by a vaccine or are simply unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Akiko Iwasaki, the lead researcher behind Yale paper, told MailOnline she understands the pre-print, which has not yet peer-reviewed by independent experts, could be seen as controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she added that they will keep studying the condition in an effort to bring affected patients 'better transparency and safer vaccines.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Independent experts, however, have urged for caution over the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing on X, Dr Adam Gaffney, an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Harvard University, also said: 'There's nothing wrong with studying vaccine side effects. There is a problem with this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're at a moment right now where the US government is undercutting people's trust in science and vaccinations probably like never before in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And to coin this novel syndrome without even proving that it's caused by the vaccine is very worrisome to me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid jabs, like any vaccine or medical product, can cause side effects which can vary in frequency and severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But mRNA vaccines are estimated to have saved tens of millions of lives globally from Covid, 1.6million in Europe and 3million in the US alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are also credited with helping end the series of paralyzing lockdowns brought on by the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no figures for the number of PVS patients in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, newly released data show 18,551 claims for compensation for injuries and deaths they believe to be caused by Covid vaccines have been made in Britain as of last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These figures relate to the Government's Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It predates the Covid shots and offers some victims of vaccine injuries and deaths a one-off payment of £120,000 (about $150,000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, only just over 200 of these claims have been deemed eligible for the sum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has been widely criticised for requiring patients to be at least 60 per cent disabled by their injuries in order to qualify for a payout — for example losing a limb, a sense like your sight, or complete paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the 11,000 with an outcome about 450 were dismissed because while medics agreed a person had been injured by the jab, the case did not meet the 60 per cent disability and therefore the applicant got nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The remainder were unsuccessful because assessors found that, on the balance of probabilities, their injury or condition had not been caused by a Covid vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A further 7,000 or so applications are still awaiting an outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Symptoms can include memory loss, such as recent events and conversations, confusion, language problems, and mood changes among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As the devastating disease damages parts of the brain, it gradually shrinks in a process called brain atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Alzheimer’s is also thought to be caused by the abnormal build up of proteins in and around brain cells.

Within days, two of her cats had to be euthanized, and a third was in an intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All of the cats that had eaten raw pet food would later test positive for bird flu. Only a male cat kept apart from the others and fed canned food stayed negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Knopp is an artist in Portland, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/oregon" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, who breeds and shows Cornish Rex cats. She has fed raw food to all but the male cat for years, and watched recent notices about tainted raw pet food carefully. She believed the food from Wild Coast was being tested for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I’ve since learned, I don’t think there’s really a safe way to trust if someone says they’re testing it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Wild Coast did not respond to the Guardian’s media inquiries about why the company &lt;a href="https://wildcoastpets.com/wild-coast-safety-steps-for-h5n1/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;waited a week&lt;/a&gt; to issue a voluntary recall after being notified of possible contamination, and whether it was reaching out to vendors and customers about the recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;If Knopp had known, she would have “immediately” switched to canned food – a move she now recommends to all cat owners who were feeding raw food they bought or made on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It is not safe,” she said. “Immediately: do not feed raw poultry or raw chicken, raw any table scraps, to cats currently – not even raw eggs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Raw milk is similarly risky, since milk can contain enormous amounts of virus, and raw beef has also been found to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/18/usda-dairy-cows-bird-flu-survey" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;harbor H5N1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Especially right now, feeding raw food is just all risk,” said Steve Valeika, a small-animal veterinarian with a public health background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;H5N1 joins a host of other pathogens – including salmonella, &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt;, campylobacter, listeria and toxoplasmosis – that have been associated with raw pet food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One of the most unnerving parts for Knopp: her cats never displayed the classic symptoms of respiratory infections, like congestion. Some of the cats had fevers, rapid breathing and eyelid swelling, and one eventually had difficulty walking – a sign of neurological impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But nothing pointed to influenza until X-rays revealed two of the cats with rapid breathing had developed severe pneumonia. That’s when they tested for bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Your average person probably wouldn’t take them to the vet with a minor fever that comes and goes,” Knopp said. “Your average person might not notice a sudden increase of breath rate, especially for a cat that’s maybe more reclusive. So I wonder how many cases are also under-reported.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Knopp was concerned that she might become infected and spread the virus herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-19" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-19" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;after newsletter promotion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I don’t want to be known as ‘Bird Flu Mary’,” she said. Her local health department conducted daily symptom check-ins, she started wearing face masks when she went out in public, and she requested a test to see if she had gotten sick. The result was negative for influenza A and B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In 2016, cats in a New York City shelter &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6986351/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;transmitted&lt;/a&gt; H7N2 to at least one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We know that cats can at least transmit another strain of bird flu directly to people,” Valeika said. “I do think these cats potentially present some risk to humans. We don’t have any idea how big that risk is, but it’s definitely one that should be taken seriously until we know better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It is not clear how tainted poultry is entering the raw pet food supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All facilities processing meat for humans are inspected by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While some meat intended for pets flows through FSIS-inspected facilities, “obviously, a great deal of protein is produced outside of FSIS-inspected facilities and is never intended for human consumption”, said Eric Deeble, deputy under-secretary for marketing and regulatory programs at the USDA, on 16 January during the last call health officials held with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;US officials were investigating whether any of the H5-positive pet products had gone through such a facility, he said, though no results have been released to the public yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Birds from affected flocks that are depopulated as part of USDA’s efforts to control H5N1 are not permitted in any food product at all,” Deeble said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Valeika added that he had “no good idea as to why we’re seeing so many sick birds making it into the [pet] food supply – because this must just be the tip of the iceberg”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There are other steps pet owners can take to protect animals, and themselves, from bird flu, Valeika said: don’t let cats outside, and don’t let dogs hunt or play with birds, including in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19081209/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ponds and lakes&lt;/a&gt; frequented by migratory birds. Mice and rats, especially near dairy and poultry farms, have also tested positive for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Knopp has been posting about her experiences and holding “ask me anything” sessions about cats and bird flu on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I’ve channeled a lot of grief into work and into education,” she said. For the two cats who were euthanized, she said, “their death gets to mean something. It can save other animals. It can save some people grief.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE40MTFSRWJWcWpQOUJqS0l3aWJET05rUElwNDZqWml3cS13VFkxRDZwSjJLX2pDYnNKYkc3ekhRbXdGQTJyclFOSFNTbE9DbWlfc3RsVWZ2VGItbWFvSHBtYzZRUklUbmRCTklKUE5n</guid></item><item><title>Exclusive | CrossFit-loving dad, 42, gets transplant after flu-like symptoms turn out to be end-stage heart failure - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQRmR4dGhXRy1tNjVXYUtwMF9uWWNjX2NnTFRkd2E4SnN6MXdSM3JWZXQxQkNqMDU3V2pNX2E5WVF0SEgycGx1N2RLaXI3NXd5Q0FOZjdxWldjcWdOSy1PRXlEMFNQcmE0OUd0RjRmYV9zazZSaGFTNllpSUxkeEJ2TWJzMDFHSC1jaVlWTWhuRGtlRGQtdFdTUE9VWVFGY2xYWDBHUW5ISmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;A New York City dad who suffered sudden heart failure and nearly lost his life is sharing his story of survival after a successful heart transplant, encouraging all men to “go to the doctor right away if you feel like something’s off — life is too precious to sit idly by.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nycmuseumgallery.org/1248/news/time-for-a-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/a&gt; was a 40-year-old CrossFit-loving fitness buff and school principal enjoying summer vacation when something suddenly went terribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The father of two was with his kids in his native Portugal in August 2023 when he experienced alarming flu-like symptoms he had never felt before. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I just felt very sick — I never coughed as violently — it hurt,” Rodrigues, now 42, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rodrigues’ flu-like symptoms turned out to be signs of heart failure. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At five-foot-11 and 175 pounds, Rodrigues should have been the portrait of health in the prime of his life — a clean eater who took pride in exercising with an at-home rower. But he became a shell of himself as months went by without one good day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was shocking — there was no warning,” he said. “It came on fast and furious.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He sought answers from six different doctors “to try to get to the bottom of what was happening.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the array of antibiotics and nasal sprays for a diagnosis of pneumonia and an upper respiratory infection didn’t cut down the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The physical change was dramatic as he hit 190 pounds due to the fluid retention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What I noticed was completely abnormal,” said Rodrigues, adding that discovering the appearance of abnormally swollen ankles made him fear it was a heart issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After two months of mysterious symptoms — including constant shortness of breath and exhaustion — Rodriguez darted for the Mount Sinai ER, where he stayed for 12 days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of a cold or respiratory virus, he learned that it was severe heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rodrigues was a a clean eater who took pride in exercising with an at-home rower when he got sick. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There were a lot of really scary nights in the hospital,” he said, adding that “not seeing my kids grow up was my worst thought. It’s still my worst thought and fear.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said it was myocarditis, a condition &lt;a href="https://news.yale.edu/2023/05/05/yale-study-reveals-insights-post-vaccine-heart-inflammation-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;increasingly associated with young males&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-024-00893-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Covid shot&lt;/a&gt;, which led to his heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The cause of the myocarditis is unknown,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since he had no family history of it and “genetic testing cleared me of [anything],” the doting dad felt grateful that he wouldn’t pass it down to his son and daughter, ages 9 and 11.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HIs heart was functioning at 10%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The term they use is end-stage heart failure,” he said, noting that the normal rate is 50% or higher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But under the care of Mount Sinai’s Dr. Anuradha Lala, he tried a variety of medications aimed at improving function of the heart and minimizing the rate at which his heart was deteriorating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;He learned he was in end-stage heart failure, with his heart functioning at just 10%. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Though genetic testing yielded ”no genetic basis” for his condition, the doctor told The Post. “We don’t know the exact reason that Andre had heart failure. But to me, his journey is about recognizing symptoms, knowing when to ask for help, attuning your mind to your body and coming to terms with being sick.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Building trust and a personal connection is so critical — especially for younger folks, who may just want to run away from the issue,” added Dr. Lala, Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant Cardiologist at the Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He worked closely with his team, had regular blood work and various tests done under therapeutic care, but there was no improvement. Other organs, including kidney and liver, were affected because they weren’t getting enough healthy oxygenated blood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surviving for his kids was his biggest motivation. “I was motivated to play soccer with them again and run around with them and they kept me really motivated” to get through this ordeal, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But by the fall of 2024, he needed to pivot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;He had no family history it and “genetic testing cleared me of [anything].” He was at lead glad he wouldn’t pass it down to his son and daughter, ages 9 and 11. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My heart could not bounce back and I needed to be put on the transplant list” while in Mount Sinai’s ICU and an impella was used to help his left ventricle pump.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Under the care of a team that included cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Anelechi Anyanwu, Rodrigues matched with a viable heart and underwent a successful eight-hour surgery in late October.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back at his Museum School in Chelsea, Manhattan, staff and students sent hundreds of emails and letters of support for the fourth-year principal, who forced himself to let go of his fears and put his complete faith in his team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though he doesn’t know much about his donor, he’s grateful for the “gift” that gave him life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By early January, Rodrigues was ready to return to his beloved school, where staff and students lined the hallways to welcome him back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a wonderful community where students show so much empathy — towards one another and to me,” he said of the emotional reunion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rodrigues was ready this January to return to his beloved school, where he is the principal. Staff and students lined the hallways to welcome him back. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The future remains bright for Rodrigues, who noted life will be different “but also beautiful at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;And, yes, that includes CrossFit in his future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The road is still long, but nothing compared to what he was on,” added Dr. Lala, who urged the public not to write off anything that feels worrisome. “The intention isn’t to promote fear, but to instill awareness, around symptoms that should prompt further evaluation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rodrigues’ message to others is to seek medical help if something feels off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is your life. This is your life and life is too precious to sit idly and not have a proper diagnosis. And even when the diagnosis is scary, trust the medical professionals and move forward with courage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Have a positive mindset and trust the medical professionals. Keep advocating for yourself and your health.”&lt;/p&gt;

A growing body of research highlights the role &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/common-mineral-supplement-may-help-prevent-cold-and-flu-symptoms-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and minerals play in preserving cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a groundbreaking study suggests that magnesium intake could be a key factor in keeping the brain healthy and lowering dementia risk. Researchers are uncovering how this essential mineral might help slow cognitive decline, offering a simple yet powerful strategy for brain preservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-023-03123-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;European Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed data from the UK Biobank, a large-scale health database. Researchers focused on magnesium consumption and its potential impact on brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Dietary Mg intake trajectories in men and women corresponding to different subgroups of individuals identified by latent class analysis.

To estimate their daily magnesium intake, researchers used a dietary questionnaire administered five times over a 16-month span. This method allowed for a detailed assessment of each participant’s typical &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3tfwgXi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were striking. Individuals consuming more than 550 milligrams of magnesium daily had “brain ages” nearly a year younger by the time they reached 55. In contrast, those consuming the average intake of about 350 milligrams showed more typical patterns of brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study lead author Khawlah Alateeq, Ph.D., from the &lt;a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ANU National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health&lt;/a&gt;, highlighted the significance of these results. “Our study shows a 41% increase in magnesium intake could lead to less age-related brain shrinkage, which is associated with better cognitive function and a decreased risk or delayed onset of dementia in later life,” she stated in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alateeq also emphasized magnesium’s potential as an early intervention for brain health. She noted, “This means people of all ages should be paying closer attention to their magnesium intake.” Her statement underscores the importance of dietary choices long before cognitive decline becomes a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also indicated that the brain-protective benefits of increased dietary magnesium were more pronounced in women—especially those post-menopause—than in men. Alateeq theorizes that this might be attributed to magnesium's &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-explore-bioengineering-vegetables-with-anti-inflammatory-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-inflammatory properties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_vital_role_of_magnesium_in_our_diet"&gt;The Vital Role of Magnesium in Our Diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is magnesium, and why is it crucial for our brain's health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melissa Prest, D.C.N., R.D.N., a prominent national media spokesperson for the &lt;a href="https://www.eatright.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics&lt;/a&gt;, explains that magnesium, found abundantly in nuts, seeds, dairy, and leafy greens, plays a critical role in maintaining our body tissues. This includes the essential task of nerve signaling in the brain and preserving the blood-brain barrier's integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Dr Erin I.

As Prest elucidates, low magnesium levels have previously been associated with a heightened risk of brain inflammation and the onset of diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s, and multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Prest sheds light on the intricate relationship between magnesium and menopause, which might explain the gender-based differences observed in the study. “High magnesium intake in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-study-suggests-that-breastfeeding-may-help-prevent-cognitive-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;post-menopausal women&lt;/a&gt; correlates with reduced inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein, indicating reduced inflammation,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="optimizing_daily_magnesium_intake"&gt;Optimizing Daily Magnesium Intake&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults' magnesium needs can fluctuate based on factors such as age and biological sex, typically ranging from 310 to 420 mg/day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Bar graph of the associations (beta values) between dietary magnesium (Mg) trajectories and a the brain volumes including gray matter, white matter, left hippocampus, right hippocampus, and white matter lesions; and b blood pressure (BP) including mean arterial pressure (MAP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP) stratified by sex.

Before starting any supplement, consulting with a healthcare professional is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_bigger_picture_on_brain_health"&gt;The Bigger Picture on Brain Health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the potential of magnesium in brain health is promising, it's essential to understand the broader picture. As Melissa Prest asserts, a balanced diet rich in magnesium-laden foods such as &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/the-incredible-benefits-of-fiber-to-human-health-and-wellbeing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;whole grains and leafy vegetables&lt;/a&gt; can enhance brain function by combating inflammation and supplying the necessary nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Dr. Amit Sachdev, Director of the Division of Neuromuscular Medicine at Michigan State University.

Hence, while these findings are compelling, they should be taken with a degree of caution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the pursuit of knowledge around &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/doing-this-one-activity-is-critical-to-healthy-ageing-and-avoiding-cognitive-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cognitive health&lt;/a&gt; continues, this study underscores the potential of magnesium as a nutritional ally in our fight against cognitive decline. Balancing our diet and incorporating magnesium-rich foods might just be the key to a sharper, healthier brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 12:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxONDRQeEVpMnVwdGV5UlgzeVdIZ3FpNGxOdFJMV3QxUXdTeUlLSkNjNE1ONmRUX1A0NTVkLWY5eUJ1dkhFa1VNRjIxZjVBeVdlZGNDWENKWDBlMU1waWpXMHNaZW5hTlpkWXpramRqTWkzcmpkVVhQdm5QQUtYbXhRRDBCejRVUDVDQ3F5VnpaR2Q1eTEySUNJVGozakNtQkRTb2N2MGRzbkFJeGZiaE0tandQOA</guid></item><item><title>Another mystery disease outbreak in DR Congo: What we know - DW (English)</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNVE94dHlUM293N3dwZm56VGtWTlpKRElrRmJjUm1McVdoWWw2WG04X2l4S1ZwVmhZMXk5ZkhJQjZuMUVmUEppY285VF9yV1FxQVhiZ2VhV0R3eUhHTGNPWUFGUXMtVVJidmU5d2djU2Y5QkVTREQ3SmdVc1RyajFYQUlRNTJRTG1jOHlfTW1ZY3o0NzhX0gGUAUFVX3lxTFBWVmtGVWFDREY2cWhDSU5tM1VnQ3FXNEl1ZnVxWl9xR25zOGNTRzloUzdHZmVlcWhac2xFeFlHa1ZOcy1kRXd3cEZ0dk9INy0waVRuYlpmT3BoQUcxWUhjbjNzTXBvUmZyUVdxMnlqR2NXYU1ScTJqTWpvOUJJY21VN1VVRHU0d3NYTng1NHo3Qm9CY0M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cc0m0op s1ebneao rich-text t1it8i9i r1wgtjne wgx1hx2 b1ho1h07"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another mystery disease outbreak in the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/democratic-republic-of-congo-drc/t-38232616"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo &lt;/a&gt; has emerged in recent weeks, resulting in at least 60 deaths, officials say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows a &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/what-we-known-about-congo-mystery-illness/a-71005734"&gt;similar event in September 2024&lt;/a&gt;, referred to as "Disease X" before the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/world-health-organization-who/t-38396203"&gt;World Health Organization (WHO)&lt;/a&gt; identified it as a cocktail of several known acute respiratory illnesses complicated by malaria and malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new outbreaks could have similar origins, but it will likely take time to determine exactly what the cause is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is the current situation in the DR Congo?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 1,000 cases have been reported across the DR Congo's Equateur province and 141 cases of a &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/infectious-diseases/t-71255642"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in Basankusu's health zone. A separate outbreak in early February consisted of 158 cases and 58 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January, Bolamba village reported 12 cases and eight deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-vendor-cmp-id="c44391" data-lang-code="en" data-id="68339716" class="embed dw-widget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What have initial tests shown?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health authorities in the DR Congo and WHO experts are carrying out investigations to determine the cause of the illness and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early lab tests ruled out &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/ebola-symptoms-treatment-vaccines-sudan-virus/a-71524627"&gt;Ebola&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/marburg-outbreaks-one-of-the-worlds-deadliest-viruses/a-64724490"&gt;Marburg disease&lt;/a&gt;. Half of those tested have tested positive for &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/malaria/t-67585233"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further testing will be undertaken for meningitis and potential toxic contamination. Influenza and typhoid have also been suggested as possible causes of disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some diseases have been ruled out, the WHO has sent epidemiologists to the region to conduct further sampling and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're not really satisfied with the sampling, so we've sent two WHO epidemiologists up there," Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesperson, told DW News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They're up there now and they're overseeing the sampling and getting them back to the laboratories in [DR Congo's capital] Kinshasa."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do officials know the potential cause?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cause of the disease — and whether the illnesses in different regions are connected — remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early reports suggested the first cases were among a group of children who may have eaten a bat, though this incident is not yet confirmed as the cause of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bats are &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/how-identifying-hotspots-of-zoonotic-disease-could-prevent-another-pandemic/a-58167867"&gt;known reservoirs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/top-10-most-dangerous-viruses-in-the-world/a-17846283"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; and other disease-causing pathogens. Global health advice recommends people steer clear of exposure to dead animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the main outbreak villages of Basankusu and Bolomba are 116 miles (186 kilometers) apart, it's unclear if the disease outbreaks share the same cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of the mystery disease?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO's latest memo says symptoms are broad, and include fever, headaches, chills, sweating, stiffness in the neck, muscular aches, joint and body pain, coughing, vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broadness of these symptoms and their potential to apply to many diseases makes it impossible to pinpoint the cause without analysis of biological samples from patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health experts say the mystery disease is likely caused by several known pathogens acting together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That malaria has been found in one in two cases already is important information for health authorities, but the addition of further sampling and analysis by WHO officials in conjunction with local teams will help narrow the search for a cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Tests are never 100% accurate, and it is likely that with increased testing, we will have a confirmed pathogen in some of those samples," said Michael Head, an epidemiologist at the University of Southampton, UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — WHO endorses new malaria vaccine for Africa rollout" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;WHO endorses new malaria vaccine for Africa rollout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-67096544" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="67096544" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/61551953_605.webp" data-duration="02:36"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20231013_QMALARIAAFR_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20231013_QMALARIAAFR_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Could the disease spread further?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health infrastructure in this region of the DR Congo is limited, and there are concerns that the disease could spread. As with the malaria-respiratory infections that caused the 2024 outbreak, malnutrition and other underlying conditions can increase the chances of death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local health authorities have been addressing Mpox and &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/who-probes-new-ebola-case-in-democratic-republic-of-congo/a-59456143"&gt;Ebola outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, so Head suggests the challenges of limited infrastructure to manage new diseases can be offset by their "experience at addressing infectious disease epidemics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should a previously unknown pathogen be identified as the cause, health authorities will need to increase measures to contain the spread of the disease and identify the method of transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) today announced the &lt;a href="/publications/m/item/recommended-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2025-2026-northern-hemisphere-influenza-season"&gt;recommendations for the viral composition of influenza vaccines for the 2025-2026 influenza season in the northern hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement was made at an information session at the end of a 4-day meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines, a meeting that is held twice annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO organizes these consultations with an advisory group of experts gathered from WHO Collaborating Centres and WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories to analyse influenza virus surveillance data generated by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). The recommendations issued are used by the national vaccine regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce, and license influenza vaccines for the following influenza season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The periodic update of viruses contained in influenza vaccines is necessary for the vaccines to be effective due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses, including those circulating and infecting humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO recommends that &lt;strong&gt;trivalent &lt;/strong&gt;vaccines for use in the 2025-2026 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Egg-based vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;an A/Croatia/10136RV/2023 (H3N2)-like virus; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cell culture-, recombinant protein- or nucleic acid-based vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;an A/District of Columbia/27/2023 (H3N2)-like virus; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommendation for the B/Yamagata lineage component of quadrivalent influenza vaccines remains unchanged from previous recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;As an outbreak of measles &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309800/texas-measles-child-death-vaccination" target="_blank"&gt;continues to spread&lt;/a&gt; in west Texas and New Mexico, many people are wondering, how bad could it get?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Well, the first thing to know is that measles is one of the most contagious diseases on Earth — more than Ebola, smallpox or just about any other infectious disease. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Before widespread vaccination eliminated the disease in the U.S., pretty much everyone got measles in childhood. And 400-500 children used to die from it each year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the vaccine's power to beat back measles outbreaks starts to crumble when vaccination rates drop low enough. We asked scientists to help us decipher how lower vaccination rates can affect spread and what that means for the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The math of measles spread&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To understand just how easily measles spreads, it helps to know a scientific concept known as the basic reproduction number, or R naught. That's the number of people, on average, that a single infected person can transmit a disease to.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The R naught for measles ranges from 12 to 18. In other words, if one person is infected, they will infect as many as 18 others on average. That's much higher than with other infectious diseases, such as Ebola with an R naught of 2.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, R naught is a theoretical number. "It's not some magical constant," says &lt;a href="https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/justin-lessler-phd/" target="_blank"&gt;Justin Lessler&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It assumes that &lt;a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/when-will-it-be-over-an-introduction-to-viral-reproduction-numbers-r0-and-re/#:~:text=The%20effective%20reproduction%20number%2C%20Re%2C%20sometimes%20also%20called%20R,and%20also%20as%20people%20die." target="_blank"&gt;no one has immunity to a given disease&lt;/a&gt;. That's what the "naught" refers to, as in zero immunity. It's useful for comparing the infectious potential of different diseases. But in the real world, a lot of different factors can alter how easily measles transmits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This brings us to a concept known as the&lt;em&gt; effective&lt;/em&gt; reproduction number. That's the number of people that a sick person can infect in a given population at any specific time. It changes as more people become immune through infection or vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It also changes depending on how people behave. Do infected people isolate? Are vulnerable, unvaccinated people clustered together, socializing with each other? That kind of situation "gives an opportunity for the virus to exist in a place," Lessler says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And, the most effective firewall against transmission is vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The graphic below shows how much a lower vaccination rate can affect measles' spread in a theoretical group of kindergartners who cluster together every weekday in a classroom.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;If a disease has a reproduction number under 1, infections will spread slowly and an outbreak will eventually die out, because each infected person spreads it to fewer than one other person on average.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the flipside, here's where exponential case growth can happen. Let's say a measles outbreak has an effective reproduction number of 3, like in the graphic above. That might not sound so bad, until you consider that those three people can go on to infect three others, and so on and so on. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In fact, the original strain of the virus that causes COVID had a reproduction number of around 3, and we all saw how that went, says &lt;a href="https://www.huck.psu.edu/people/matthew-ferrari" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of biology and the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Penn State University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's not unreasonable to think that measles could spread as fast as [pre-vaccine] SARS-CoV-2 in populations, particularly in school settings, where kids are vaccinated at 80-85%," Ferrari says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Vulnerable Texas counties&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The kindergarten vaccination rate for measles in Gaines County, the epicenter of the current outbreak in Texas, is just below 82%. That's well below the 95% vaccination rate threshold needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Nationwide, measles vaccination rates have been falling for years and are currently at 92.7%. In some communities, kindergarten vaccination rates are much lower, creating pockets of opportunity for measles to spread.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;About half of the counties in Texas have a kindergarten vaccination rate below that 95% threshold. In Foard County, Texas, the rate stands at just under 67%. In a classroom with that vaccination rate, one infected child would infect five other unvaccinated classmates with measles on average.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;You can find even lower vaccination rates if you drill down to the school level. One private school in Fort Worth, Texas, reported a kindergarten vaccination rate of just over 14%. That's not to say the outbreak will reach places like this, but if it did, they'd be very vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lessler says many factors will determine how far this outbreak spreads and how big it gets. That includes how many people get vaccinated in response to the outbreak, whether suspected cases are quarantined, and how well contact tracing works so exposed people don't infect others.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And that's critical, because a person infected with measles can be contagious from four days before the telltale measles rash appears, until four days after, says &lt;a href="https://www.childrens.com/doctor-profile/carla-garcia-carreno" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric infectious disease specialist with Children's Medical Center Plano in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So you can be spreading it without knowing you have the measles," Carreno says. A person with measles can emit infectious particles that linger in the air for up to two hours, long after they've left the room. "That's what makes it also difficult to control."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Lessler says in conditions where under-vaccinated people are grouped together — such as the close-knit rural community &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/first-measles-death-reported-in-west-texas-outbreak-thats-infected-more-than-120-people" target="_blank"&gt;where the current outbreak is largely spreading&lt;/a&gt; — measles has the potential to cause reasonably sized outbreaks. But he thinks the firewall provided by higher vaccination and immunity levels in the broader population will eventually tamp down the  outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Are we at risk of getting, like in the old days, thousands or tens of thousands of cases from this outbreak? That's probably pretty unlikely," Lessler says. "The [vaccination] firewall is still pretty strong at that sort of broad level."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But if measles vaccination rates continue their downward trend amid &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/12/06/nx-s1-5218574/rfk-vaccines-anti-vaccine-infectious-disease" target="_blank"&gt;rising anti-vaccine sentiment&lt;/a&gt;, he says the days when measles outbreaks involve thousands of cases could return within the next five to 10 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
