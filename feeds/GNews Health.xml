Researchers tracked 305 cognitively healthy individuals over 15 years and discovered that high cortisol predicted amyloid buildup later in life, but only among women who had gone through menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that hormonal changes may amplify cortisol’s harmful effects on brain health. No similar relationship was found in men or with tau protein, another Alzheimer’s marker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-Specific Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; High midlife cortisol predicted Alzheimer’s risk only in post-menopausal women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amyloid Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Cortisol levels were associated with increased amyloid buildup, not tau.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings suggest early stress reduction and hormone-based strategies could lower Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UT San Antonio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can stress lead to Alzheimer’s disease?

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing midlife cortisol levels at the beginning of a 15-year period with disease indicators at the end, the researchers were able to determine that those levels could serve as an Alzheimer’s disease biomarker, with particular attention to gender differences and menopausal status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No significant associations were observed in males or with tau burden, referring to the tau protein that contributes to neuronal dysfunction and death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The results highlight the importance of identifying early risk factors when biomarkers are detectable but cognitive impairment is absent,” said Arash Salardini, MD, associate professor of cognitive and behavioral neurology with the Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salardini is first author of the study titled, “Elevated serum cortisol associated with early-detected increase of brain amyloid deposition in Alzheimer’s disease imaging biomarkers among menopausal women: The Framingham Heart Study,” published April 24 in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other authors also are with UT Health San Antonio, as well as the University of Texas School of Public Health San Antonio; Framingham Heart Study of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health; Boston University; Gonzaba Medical Group, San Antonio; University of Galway, Ireland; Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School; New York University Grossman School of Medicine; Brigham and Women’s Hospital; Yale University; and the University of California at Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work shows that considering sex and hormonal status in understanding Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis is important, and suggests that stress reduction and hormonal interventions may hold promise for Alzheimer’s prevention, especially in at-risk women,” said Sudha Seshadri, founding director of the Biggs Institute and senior author of the study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting risk factors early&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study notes that “sporadic” Alzheimer’s disease is the leading cause of cognitive decline in older adults. That features a prolonged asymptomatic phase of amyloid beta accumulation, the main component of amyloid plaques, eventually triggering progressive cognitive decline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recognizing that these biological changes are already well established by the time symptoms emerge, effective early interventions must target Alzheimer’s disease risk factors during the preclinical stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, despite significant advancements in understanding how the disease affects the body’s normal biological processes, more than half of the overall risk has remained unexplained, underscoring the critical need to identify additional risk factors that can be targeted during the preclinical stage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One promising line of investigation centers on cortisol, a steroid hormone essential for cellular homeostasis, or balance, and the stress response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic studies had identified mutations in glucocorticoid, or steroid hormones that have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, signaling pathways that increase susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies had reported that higher blood cortisol levels are linked to an increased likelihood of developing the disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To address gaps and inconsistencies across those studies, the researchers led by UT Health San Antonio conducted a longitudinal analysis using data from the third-generation cohort of the Framingham Heart Study, which dates to 1948 and now is directed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They assessed the relationship between serum cortisol levels in the 305 cognitively unimpaired, middle-aged individuals – 48.5% female, with a mean age of 39.6 years –and amyloid/tau burdens approximately 15 years later using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. And they performed multivariable regression analyses adjusted for confounders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All this allowed them to investigate cortisol’s impact at an earlier stage of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis, where interventions might be most effective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given the neuroprotective effects of estrogen and testosterone, which mitigate cortisol’s deleterious impact on neural tissues, they also explored sex-specific differences, focusing particularly on post-menopausal risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They hypothesized that cortisol’s impact on Alzheimer’s pathology would be more pronounced in women, especially after menopause, consistent with some previous findings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, they found that post-menopausal women with high midlife cortisol are at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease, and that post-menopausal hormone changes may amplify cortisol’s effects on amyloid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Longitudinal follow-up of our cohort will be crucial to determine whether these early amyloid changes translate into clinical symptoms and to clarify the causal role of cortisol in Alzheimer’s disease development,” Salardini said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1d7178786e2f2f5d6869756e7e6e7c33787968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Steven Lee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uthscsa.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UT San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Steven Lee – UT San Antonio&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/alz.70179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elevated serum cortisol associated with early-detected increase of brain amyloid deposition in Alzheimer’s disease imaging biomarkers among menopausal women: The Framingham Heart Study&lt;/a&gt;” by Arash Salardini et al. &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevated serum cortisol associated with early-detected increase of brain amyloid deposition in Alzheimer’s disease imaging biomarkers among menopausal women: The Framingham Heart Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70179-sec-0010-title"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigates whether midlife cortisol levels predict Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarker burden 15 years later, with particular attention to sex differences and menopausal status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70179-sec-0020-title"&gt;METHODS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed data from 305 cognitively unimpaired Framingham Heart Study participants (48.5% female; mean age: 39.6 ± 8.1 years).

Researchers found both interferon responses and inflammation were elevated simultaneously—something never before observed in other viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T and B cells in these infants were still naïve yet highly activated, and some even produced their own strong antibody responses, surprising scientists given their age. These findings suggest that infants’ immune systems operate on distinct principles and may require age-specific strategies for treatment and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; Infants showed simultaneous high interferon and inflammation—unusual in viral infections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naïve but Active:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite never encountering infection, infants’ T and B cells were strongly activated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Antibodies:&lt;/strong&gt; Some infants produced robust SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, despite relying on maternal immunity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infants hospitalized with severe COVID-19 have significantly different immune responses than adults or older children. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding comes from scientists at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai and Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers established the unique features of hospitalized infants’ immune cells during mild, moderate and severe COVID-19. The study may help identify better ways to protect infants from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the first studies to characterize the immune response in young infants hospitalized with severe COVID-19 with high-resolution,” said co-corresponding author Octavio Ramilo, MD, St. Jude Department of Infectious Diseases chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the infant immune system’s response to SARS-CoV-2 looks nothing like the immune response at any other age, highlighting the need to study infants, specifically, if we want to prevent severe infections and understand the unique features of the infant immune system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collaborators studied immune cells from infants ranging from a few weeks to 16 months old who were hospitalized with mild, moderate or severe disease. They compared those cells to immune cells from healthy infants and a published cohort of adults hospitalized with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monocytes (a type of white blood cell) from hospitalized infants appeared to have some similar features to those in adults infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, two other major white blood cell types, T and B cells, looked very different than in any other group. Hospitalized infants had more CD4 T cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, both T and B cells were still activated despite being largely naïve, having never encountered an infection. These infants’ T and B cells also expressed the antiviral interferon response, which led to high expression of interferon-stimulated genes at a much higher level than in older children or adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflicting signals from the infant immune system &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all infant immune cells expressed high levels of interferon-stimulated genes. At the same time, when the collaborators tested blood from these infants, they found high levels of inflammation-causing molecules (inflammatory cytokines), which differs from previous observations in infants with mild infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings challenge previous beliefs about infant immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Normally, we think about the interferon and inflammation systems being in balance with each other,” said co-first author M. Asunción Mejías, MD, PhD, St. Jude Department of Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If one is upregulated, the other is downregulated. But what we found was different. In infants, both systems were upregulated in the same cells, monocytes, which we’ve never seen before in other respiratory viral infections.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists identified the differences in these infants’ immune responses through single-cell RNA sequencing of white blood cells. RNA is a copy of instructions from DNA that lets cells express genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By looking at the RNA from individual cells, the researchers found the features unique to infants and compared them by disease severity. They found more severe disease associated with higher interferon and interferon-stimulated gene expression. High levels of inflammatory cytokines also correlated with more severe disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s unclear whether these high levels of interferon, interferon-stimulated genes and inflammatory cytokines are protecting those with severe disease or contributing to it,” Ramilo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But they are clearly playing a critical role, which will require further studies.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding infant antibody response is a field in its infancy &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B cells produce specialized molecules called antibodies that target particular parts of viruses, bind to them and stop infections. An infant typically relies on their mother’s antibodies until they are about 6 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, the researchers examined whether a mother’s immunity to non-SARS coronaviruses, which cause the common cold, would help protect infants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that these infants made a strong and robust new antibody response to SARS-CoV-2,” said Mejías.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their pre-existing maternal antibodies against the endemic coronaviruses did not block infection at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding was surprising; some infants were as young as just a few weeks old and still created an antibody response to the virus. Infants are typically much older before they begin building such responses for other respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The children in the study also lacked anti-interferon antibodies, which have been associated with severe COVID-19 in adults, emphasizing that lessons from adult immunity may not translate to infant immune responses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We showed that these hospitalized infants responded to SARS-CoV-2, but differently than anyone else,” Ramilo said. “As COVID-19 is now an endemic disease, we need to understand the unique features of the infant immune system better so we can find ways to help these babies through such infections during their first months of life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors and funding &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s other first author is Djamel Nehar-Belaid of The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine.

Compared with infected adults, infants display a similar ISG signature in monocytes but a markedly enhanced ISG signature in T and B cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings provide insights into the distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the first year of life and underscore the importance of further defining the unique features of early life immunity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 14:59:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBsVmlNUUd4TVhRTWkxQ1FTQkNOcG9pc3JZem1MOGlyeVpUcm4tZFFpSlJQdmhuS0QtRDJsUmJWUVFZV1pmcWdZeXR3Qzhxejk5SVZiMmpxeUc4cVBZLW0yeC02VXdJbE9MNEFWZGNkRQ</guid></item><item><title>一劳永逸的治愈方法：全新凝胶可在24小时内消除耳部感染- SciTechDaily | One-and-Done Cure: New Gel Wipes Out Ear Infections in 24 Hours - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxOanQxTG1vdm5jWUY2RTRvblFqejFtVlhuTElnQWJhajJYUkNSWGdkelJOcGlyMkNVbWhmbHhWaXNuWXNmN2hiX0FhZmc2NGxfUFNVNEFEMGdtek5qZXNONzFEZ09tdXhpcnBnUzZQbDFmN3QxbkdYdFlDeU9pM0ZyRU94LXBMb1NISHotOVhuM2ZnZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 14:11:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOanQxTG1vdm5jWUY2RTRvblFqejFtVlhuTElnQWJhajJYUkNSWGdkelJOcGlyMkNVbWhmbHhWaXNuWXNmN2hiX0FhZmc2NGxfUFNVNEFEMGdtek5qZXNONzFEZ09tdXhpcnBnUzZQbDFmN3QxbkdYdFlDeU9pM0ZyRU94LXBMb1NISHotOVhuM2ZnZw</guid></item><item><title>心平气和：根据焦虑类型选择正念-神经科学新闻 | Calm Your Mind: Choose Mindfulness by Anxiety Type - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTFBKMmg0TmllWFlMZlhVVHRwUjNRRFRmQWl5RWNJZnlOa1NrbjJHUnlVQkdydmZIT3hXb09zM3owc0ZlYlRDUjJHdm1LX3BTT1R3cDZTejM1akduandzaTZNem1iNmIwRk9GYThIb3ZOeWI3YzFf?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Mindfulness is well known for its calming effects, but researchers now propose that different types of mindfulness practices may be more effective for specific types of anxiety. A new framework suggests that focused attention meditation may benefit those who worry chronically, while open monitoring may help individuals with hypervigilance and physical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key mechanism behind this benefit is improved cognitive control—the ability to manage thoughts and behaviors in alignment with goals. Anxiety disrupts this control, but mindfulness strengthens it, helping to break the cycle of worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tailored Practices:&lt;/strong&gt; Focused attention helps worriers; open monitoring helps the hypervigilant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Control:&lt;/strong&gt; Mindfulness improves goal-oriented thinking disrupted by anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientific Support:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain imaging confirms mindfulness alters areas linked to emotional regulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re anxious about work, finances, the state of the world, or anything else, you might try a moment of mindfulness. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paying close attention to the present moment without judgment — the basic idea behind all mindfulness techniques — can help calm anxiety and improve focus, said Resh Gupta, a postdoctoral research associate with the Mindfulness Science and Practice research cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “A lot of research has shown that mindfulness can reduce anxiety symptoms,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110055"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman and bight colors." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Depending on the type of anxiety people are experiencing, some approaches might work better than others. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calming power of mindfulness is well-known to people who have made the practice a part of their daily lives. Still, experts continue to investigate how it works and which types of mindfulness might be most useful for different types of anxiety, ranging from fleeting bouts of worry to more chronic, clinical anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We all experience anxiety, but it can manifest in many different ways,” Gupta said. “It’s a tough problem to pin down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper published in&lt;em&gt; Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews&lt;/em&gt;, Gupta and co-authors laid out a new approach to understanding the relationship between mindfulness and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of taking a one-size-fits-all approach, they propose that different kinds of mindfulness practices might be helpful for different varieties of anxiety. The proposed framework should ultimately help us understand how to match anxiety sufferers with more precise treatments, Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todd Braver, the William R. Stuckenberg Professor in Human Values and Moral Development and a professor of psychological and brain sciences, is a co-author of the paper. The other co-author is Wendy Heller, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported in part by the Mindfulness Science and Practice cluster and the Arts &amp;amp; Sciences’ Incubator for Transdisciplinary Futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braver said that the new paper is emblematic of the kinds of work being done by the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a growing recognition that these practices can be incredibly useful in enhancing psychological well-being,” Braver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But we still do not fully understand the mechanisms of action by which mindfulness can produce beneficial effects. That’s where the scientific research can be so valuable, by helping us more precisely identify why and how certain practices are effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta, Braver, and Heller suggest that mindfulness combats anxiety by improving a mental process called cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive control is the ability to regulate your thoughts and your actions in a way that helps you achieve your goals,” Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, if you know you have to go to the grocery store right after work, you can keep that goal in mind during the workday and turn down an offer to do something else after work.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Gupta explained, mindfulness and anxiety have opposite impacts on cognitive control. People who are more mindful generally perform better on tasks requiring cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That observation is supported by neuroimaging studies, which have shown that mindfulness meditation can effectively modulate activity in brain regions that support cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, anxiety can worsen cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Worry occupies a lot of space in the brain’s working memory system,” Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is where your goals are stored.” This impairment in cognitive control can intensify worry symptoms, but using mindfulness to improve cognitive control can help interrupt the harmful cycle of worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the type of anxiety people are experiencing, some approaches might work better than others, Gupta said. People who spend a lot of time worrying may especially benefit from a type of mindfulness meditation called focused attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Focused attention teaches you to choose an anchor, such as your breath or a sound,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You keep bringing your attention back to that anchor every time your mind wanders. Instead of focusing on the worry, you’re focusing on the present moment experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are hypervigilant and experiencing a lot of physical symptoms of anxiety — rapid heartbeat, sweaty palms, tightness in the chest — may do better with a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For this type of anxiety, a form of mindfulness meditation called open monitoring may be beneficial,” Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of focusing on one thing, such as the breath, you can observe all internal and external experiences from moment to moment in a non-reactive, non-judgmental way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WashU’s Mindfulness Science &amp;amp; Practice cluster offers many resources for university and community members who want to add mindfulness to their lives. The cluster sponsors regular talks as well as other events, including those in which participants can learn mindfulness practices from trained practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re dedicated to helping the WashU and greater St. Louis community get access to tools to learn about mindfulness science and practice,” Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braver is enthusiastic that recent research from the cluster and other institutions will help people gain a greater appreciation of the wide variety of practices that fall under the mindfulness umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People have different options they can choose from, so it becomes easier to find one that best fits your particular temperament, concerns, or current situation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s quite empowering to learn these types of practices, and to feel like we can be in charge of how we use them to improve our quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mindfulness and anxiety research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6b0718030a0d0d0e192b1c1e181f07450e0f1e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chris Woolston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wustl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WUSTL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact:&lt;/strong&gt; Chris Woolston – WUSTL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reconceptualizing the relationship between anxiety, mindfulness, and cognitive control&lt;/a&gt;” by Resh Gupta et al. &lt;em&gt;Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconceptualizing the relationship between anxiety, mindfulness, and cognitive control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research has provided initial support for the claim that cognitive control mediates the relationship between anxiety and mindfulness; however, findings are often inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this review, we argue that the inconsistency may be due to a lack of both conceptual and methodological precision in terms of how anxiety, cognitive control, and mindfulness are operationalized and assessed, and that this imprecision may be a critical source of study confounds and ambiguous outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We unpack this argument by first decomposing anxiety, cognitive control, mindfulness, and relevant experimental paradigms into key dimensions in order to develop a non-unitary, multi-dimensional taxonomy of these constructs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, we review and reinterpret the prior experimental literature, focusing on studies that examine the relationship between anxiety and cognitive control, mindfulness and cognitive control, and the three-way relationship between anxiety, mindfulness, and cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the reviewed studies, there was great variation in the dimensions being examined and the behavioral and/or neural measures employed; therefore, results were often mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on this review of literature, we propose a conceptually and methodologically precise framework from which to study the effects of mindfulness on cognitive control in anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The framework theoretically aligns anxiety dimensions with specific mindfulness states and interventions, further suggesting how these will impact specific cognitive control dimensions (proactive, reactive).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These can be assessed with experimental paradigms and associated behavioral and neural metrics to index the relevant dimensions with high precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novel experimental studies and tractable research designs are also proposed to rigorously test this theoretical framework.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 13:52:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBKMmg0TmllWFlMZlhVVHRwUjNRRFRmQWl5RWNJZnlOa1NrbjJHUnlVQkdydmZIT3hXb09zM3owc0ZlYlRDUjJHdm1LX3BTT1R3cDZTejM1akduandzaTZNem1iNmIwRk9GYThIb3ZOeWI3YzFf</guid></item><item><title>呼吸困难、恶心、咳嗽和肿块提示癌症。是吗？ -《华盛顿邮报》 | Breathlessness, nausea, a cough and a mass suggested cancer.

She also began coughing incessantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J7XQDATGKNCMNMNFUMCC7GBI3U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We thought it was food poisoning and brushed it off, but I was throwing up once or twice a day, every day,” says Cresencia, now 27, who works remotely for a health insurance company as a user experience manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2WZZ5YLV5JGRVGBDRXFEDGGI2E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“She was also coughing up small amounts of blood,” recalls Nguyen, now 28, a software engineer. “It really freaked me out,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZMZUHA6P3NBIRMJJPTXSKUSZQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nevertheless, they continued on with the trip but curtailed their activities and food, and flew home at the end of the week. Once back in San Diego, Cresencia says, “the symptoms seemed to calm down a bit, I started to go days without throwing up, and my breathing also improved. I told myself it had to have been something about New York.” But a few weeks later, while in the San Francisco Bay Area visiting Nguyen, she suddenly developed a new and worrisome symptom: very swollen feet. “They didn’t hurt.

She was terrified. “My heart dropped and my ears felt hot,” she recalls. “How did it form? Did I have cancer?

The New York trip changed that. “It was worse than usual,” she says, and the bouts of nausea and bloody coughing were new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J47XN4DOZVBFLLT7QY243DATTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At the urgent care, doctors were clearly worried about the mass they’d seen on the CT scan and urged Cresencia to go to the hospital. The couple went to a small community hospital near Nguyen’s home in the San Francisco Bay Area. After a six-hour wait, a physician finally examined her and immediately admitted her to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J6FYURH5XVFFTJ6DWPO4WYT45E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The next day, wanting a closer look, the doctors at the hospital ran a transesophageal echocardiogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to view detailed images of the heart and its surrounding structures. It showed a large growth in the left atrium, one of the heart’s two upper chambers, and doctors told her it almost certainly was the underlying cause of her symptoms. They recommended she seek specialty care at a larger hospital, and a week later, in San Diego, doctors at a second hospital ran additional tests, saw the mass and also told her they thought they saw “holes in my lungs,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GWVGMNAJ6JAQBCB4QM5SWMBWYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The doctors told her she would probably need a heart-lung transplant and sent her to Jacobs Medical Center at UC San Diego Health in La Jolla, the only hospital in the area that performs such surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body grid-body grid-center" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-testid="quote" class="wpds-c-hqmxme wpds-c-hqmxme-fDUVQq-showBorder-true wpds-c-hqmxme-iPJLV-css article-quote relative border-box font-light black font--headline mr-lg-mod-ns"&gt;&lt;p data-contentid="BHBM76UGCBD65EPZHX2I3N33QA" data-apitype="text" data-qa="article-quote" class="wpds-c-PJLV"&gt;“We thought it was food poisoning and brushed it off, but I was throwing up once or twice a day, every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="wpds-c-jFMeKj"&gt;— Chelsea Cresencia &lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MANK6X3NCZCQLOHUTMBFLS3SXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There, cardiac specialists told Cresencia there were no holes in her lungs, but they thought she had an angiosarcoma of the heart, a rare and virulent cancer that originates in the lining of the blood vessels and has a grim prognosis. “They told me … it wouldn’t look good if that’s what it was,” she says. “I was terrified.

But that procedure failed when they couldn’t get a probe past the outer rim of the mass to collect the needed cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZM4E6EBDVRFKLAYNGO7LIZS3K4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A second attempt was even worse: The mass was blocking veins that carry blood from the lungs into the left side of the heart, where the mass was, which was causing pulmonary hypertension, or high blood pressure in the lungs. Under anesthesia, the right side of Cresencia’s heart — already under strain — experienced failure and circulatory collapse, known as shock. When this happens, the circulatory system is unable to supply oxygen and nutrients to the body’s tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T7I7WV37PBDDJKJ7E5TIRBUNVU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To save her, the doctors hooked Cresencia up to life-support technology that takes over a patient’s breathing and heart function. She was on an ECMO — or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation — machine for 10 days, intubated and sedated until she finally stabilized, and while her doctors debated what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4YMHQOXLXFAQFMSB7K4GE4OUME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;They decided they had no choice but to operate and remove as much of the mass as possible, even not knowing exactly what it was. Given that her heart failure was worsening, “there were no other options other than trying to remove as much of the tumor as possible. … Without surgery, we considered her prognosis terminal,” Urey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IABDCWPQ45CEJN2ABGTBT25DZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I told the surgeon she will die if we do nothing,” Urey recalls, and then reached out to her family “and everyone was on the same page. She was&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;at high risk of dying if we identified a sarcoma, but had a 100 percent certainty of death if we did nothing. Everyone wanted to give it a shot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZVBDXDGIPFF43GKJ6LSJ7ICPKI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;They scheduled immediate surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XBJLTB5EMFDCBJ4U4BJVC6Z3YE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cresencia has no memory of her time on ECMO or of going into surgery. However, her doctors and Nguyen recall how at one point she scribbled “I love you” with a permanent marker on the arms of Nguyen, her parents and her five siblings. The night before her surgery, Cresencia gave her surgeon, Victor Pretorius, a fist bump and handed him a note where she had written: “You got this!” Pretorius recalls her anxiety. “I could see it in her eyes, the fear. She was really courageous, trying to say goodbye to her family. It was very hard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UVMGKUXPEJCK5PE7K52C2TK6KM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The surgery took nearly 10 hours and involved an 11-person team of two surgeons, three anesthesiologists, four nurses and two technicians. With Cresencia still on ECMO, Pretorius removed her heart and — while it was outside her body — cut away the tumor and reconstructed the affected left atrium using artificial pig tissue. He also removed scar tissue from three of four pulmonary veins to open them up. He says he couldn’t do much with the fourth because it was too scarred. The doctors then put her heart back into her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SRWNDQRRKNHRVP4A4OHWNTIPGQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pretorius says the mass he’d removed “looked nothing like angiosarcoma. It was hard and leathery. I wasn’t sure what it was. I took a piece of it and sent it to the pathologist for a quick evaluation. They called back within an hour and told us they didn’t see any malignant cells.” So it was not a deadly angiosarcoma as they had feared. But pathologists saw a type of white blood cell called histiocytes, which provided the first real clue about what was wrong with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="YGZXRGVUAZBB7MEHOVM67U4PLM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="YGZXRGVUAZBB7MEHOVM67U4PLM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The pathology report&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GPJNPH2EZRAD7O2QISSZLMLGQU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When the final pathology report finally came in, the analysis found that the mass was made up of a proliferation of histiocytes — the hallmark of a very rare disorder known as &lt;a href="https://histio.org/histiocytic-disorders/rosai-dorfman-disease/" target="_blank"&gt;Rosai-Dorfman disease&lt;/a&gt;, a condition that most often affects children, teens and young adults. Only about 1 in every 200,000 people get it, according to the Cleveland Clinic. It causes an overgrowth of the immune system’s white blood cells, most often in lymph nodes, leading to excessive swelling, but also much less commonly in other sites in the body as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OJONIP54BJHQRNE76OQOIA2VUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Most physicians have never heard of it,” says Aaron Goodman, the UC San Diego hematologist who now is monitoring her. “They don’t know what it is and have never seen it. [It] is an incredibly rare disease to begin with, and hers was a very rare presentation of a very rare disease. It was in a bad spot and could have been lethal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HUUKVRME5ZHBBH4DZGPGG2YSEQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In some patients, treatment includes the use of medications such as steroids, drugs to suppress the immune system and sometimes chemotherapy. In Cresencia’s case, however, physicians believe they removed the entire tumor, so “there is nothing for me to do except surveillance,” Goodman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DJ4F6KRJZ5D6FFDNVQKT4YH4HI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cresencia has periodic MRIs to ensure it doesn’t return — and so far, it hasn’t. Goodman says it can come back, but experts don’t know what percentage of patients experience a recurrence.

Analyzing data from over 2,500 individuals, researchers identified combinations of personality traits—called personality styles—that either increase or protect against long-term mental health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High neuroticism consistently emerged as a risk factor, while low neuroticism and other balanced trait profiles appeared to be protective. These findings challenge the idea that personality is fixed and suggest that traits may be modifiable through therapy or coaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Styles:&lt;/strong&gt; Specific personality trait combinations forecast depression risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modifiable Traits:&lt;/strong&gt; Traits once considered fixed may be improved through therapy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized Care:&lt;/strong&gt; Personality tests could guide tailored bipolar treatment planning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with cancer, heart disease and other conditions have come to expect treatments that their medical teams “personalize” just for them, based on tests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But care for mental health conditions hasn’t gotten to that point yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study suggests that it might be possible to personalize care for people with bipolar disorder, using the results of detailed personality tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research finds that such tests might help identify people who have certain combinations of personality traits that could raise or lower their risk of repeated depressive episodes or poor functioning in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from more than 2,500 people with bipolar disorder who took part in two long-term studies, the researchers say certain personality styles – combinations of personality traits – emerged as predictors of bipolar disorder outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These personality styles are based on within person characteristics rather than these characteristics between individuals.  Thus, they are very personalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ratio of protective personality styles to risk-elevating personality styles was especially important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, by researchers from the University of Michigan’s Heinz C. Prechter Bipolar Research Program, is published in the Journal of Affective Disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Kelly Ryan, Ph.D., a neuropsychologist and professor in the U-M Department of Psychiatry, notes that the personality tests used in the study are often used in psychology settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings are really exciting because we don’t know why some patients with bipolar disorder are more resilient and bounce back or have fewer episodes of depression, but now we can see that this could be linked to the makeup of their personality,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope that this can eventually inform the treatment planning that clinicians do for patients, knowing who may be at higher risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients, too, could act on the result of their personality tests, using them to help understand their experience and working with their clinicians to modify traits that might raise their long-term risk of depression and poor life management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personality traits were once thought of as enduring characteristics for each individual, but now there’s evidence that traits can change over the course of therapy or with coaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, someone who scores low on the “openness” personality trait – which, when in the normal or average range, is protective — might be guided therapeutically to seek out new experiences through arts or nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More about the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan and her colleagues used data from the Prechter program’s long-term study that’s been gathering data on hundreds of people with bipolar disorder over more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study is based on a sample of 489 people with bipolar disorder who took the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R), a 240-item personality test, as well as taking short questionnaires in follow up clinical assessments about their level of depression and life functioning every two months and/or every two years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers assigned each person to their individual personality styles based on scores for various combinations of traits using their test results, a standard practice using the NEO-PI-R, and then looked at each person’s number of major depressive episodes and life functioning scores over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the 30 personality styles emerged as having higher risk for depression and poor functioning, while other personality styles emerged as lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, all the personality styles that included a high score on the personality trait called neuroticism (prone to emotional instability and negative thinking) appeared to raise the risk of depression. And styles that involved a low score on neuroticism appeared to be protective against depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other personality styles not involving neuroticism also were associated with higher or lower risk of frequent depression episodes too. The same held true for predicting poor life functioning, with low levels of neuroticism appearing to be especially protective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, they tested this framework on data from another group of over 2,000 people with bipolar disorder, who had enrolled in the STEP-BD trial and taken the shorter NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) personality test. The STEP-BD group had their depression and life functioning measured by clinicians every three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two-thirds of the 12 personality risk styles that had predicted higher risk of depression in the Prechter group also predicted it in this larger group, while  9 of the 16 styles that had seemed protective in the Prechter group also seemed to have that protective effect in this group. This replication helps Ryan and her colleagues have confidence in the model they created using Prechter data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan notes that it’s the interaction between personality styles, and the balance of protective vs. risk-increasing ones, that appears to matter most and can potentially be used clinically to help those with bipolar have less depressive episodes and higher life functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the Heinz C.

Scientists created an Alzheimer’s Disease Fly Cell Atlas to profile gene expression across 219 cell types in flies expressing human Alzheimer’s proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that Aβ42 mainly damages neurons, particularly those tied to senses like smell, while Tau impacts peripheral tissues, disrupting metabolism, digestion, and fertility. These findings highlight how Alzheimer’s disrupts brain-body communication and accelerates aging-like changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole-Body Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Aβ42 and Tau proteins affect both brain and peripheral tissues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Aβ42 harms sensory neurons, while Tau disrupts metabolism and fertility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Research Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; The Fly Cell Atlas enables exploration of Alzheimer’s beyond the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While Alzheimer’s disease is mostly considered a disorder of the brain, emerging evidence suggests that the condition also affects other organs of the body. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with the laboratory fruit fly, researchers at Baylor College of Medicine, the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children’s Hospital (Duncan NRI) and collaborating institutions provide a new understanding of how Alzheimer’s disease affects different tissues across the entire body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110043"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a head." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers created Alzheimer’s disease fruit flies by expressing Aβ42 or Tau only in the neurons of adult flies. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;, reveal new insights into brain-body communication in neurodegeneration and pave the way for identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation in the brain of amyloid plaques containing the Aβ42 protein and tangles of thread-like structures of the Tau protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To better understand how the disorder affects other organs in the body, we created an Alzheimer’s Disease Fly Cell Atlas, which profiles the genes expressed by single cells of 219 cell types in the heads and bodies of Alzheimer’s disease fruit flies,” said co-corresponding author Dr.  Hongjie Li, assistant professor of molecular and human genetics and the Huffington Center on Aging at Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is also a member of Baylor’s Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers created Alzheimer’s disease fruit flies by expressing Aβ42 or Tau only in the neurons of adult flies. This approach avoids developmental effects and focuses on adult characteristics. Then, they assessed the presence of changes in the brains and other organs of these modified flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that expressing Aβ42 or Tau in neurons affected both neurons and other tissues in the fruit fly body,” said co-first author Ye-Jin Park, a graduate student co-mentored by Li and Dr. Hugo Bellen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aβ42 expression primarily affected the nervous system. Sensory neurons involved in vision, audition and olfaction were particularly vulnerable. A decline in the sense of smell can be an early symptom of Alzheimer’s disease, and in this study we identified specific olfactory neurons affected by Aβ42 in fruit flies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the other hand, Tau expression in neurons led to significant changes, mostly in peripheral tissues, for instance altered fat metabolism and digestion and reduced fecundity. These alterations mimic age-associated changes, suggesting that Tau expression accelerates aging,” said co-first author Dr. Tzu-Chiao Lu, a postdoctoral associate in the Li lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that neuronal connectivity and other factors that mediate brain-body communication were disrupted in Tau flies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These and other findings described in the Alzheimer’s Disease Fly Cell Atlas improve our understanding of how Alzheimer’s disease-associated proteins, Aβ42 and Tau, affect an organism as a whole,” said Bellen, co-corresponding author of the work. Bellen is a Distinguished Service Professor of Molecular and Human Genetics at Baylor and chair in neurogenetics&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the Duncan NRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive resource serves as a valuable tool for the neurodegeneration research community. The Alzheimer’s Disease Fly Cell Atlas enables further exploration of whole-body changes and brain-body interactions in Alzheimer’s disease that may lead to a better understanding of the condition and improved treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other contributors to this work include Tyler Jackson, Lindsey goodman, Lindsey Ran, Jiaye Chen, Chung-Yi Liang, Erin Harrison, Christina Ko, Xi Chen, Baiping Wang, Ao-Lin Hsu, Elizabeth Ochoa, Kevin F.

However, a comprehensive understanding of how AD impacts different tissues across the whole organism is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;, we generated an AD Fly Cell Atlas (AD-FCA) based on whole-organism single-nucleus transcriptomes of 219 cell types from flies expressing AD-associated proteins, either human amyloid-β 42 peptide (Aβ42) or Tau, in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that Aβ42 primarily affects the nervous system, including sensory neurons, while Tau induces accelerated aging in peripheral tissues. We identified a neuronal cluster enriched in Aβ42 flies, which has high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This LDH-high cluster is conserved in 5XFAD mouse and human AD datasets. We found a conserved defect in fat metabolism from both fly and mouse tauopathy models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AD-FCA offers new insights into how Aβ42 or Tau systemically and differentially affects a whole organism and provides a valuable resource for understanding brain-body communication in neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 12:29:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFBITnRLNkxnUHJlWmdkUkxnYkFvbFQ3NzVPM19PR2dtc2RocnU2VjNzb05TVVdyZXpXaF9wTnpsbmx2MWJ2QzN3RGZJSFZfMXhDd3BjX005RGNxODZNd1dmNlBwcy1KUXJ1</guid></item><item><title>吸入DMT在治疗抵抗性抑郁症中产生快速持久的抗抑郁作用- PsyPost | Inhaled DMT produces rapid and lasting antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxPWEZTZHhUU3l1Nlk5M0ZBd3RiX0MwNnJmYU5nV1NpWG8yZXdaUlkyeTRjX0d2Mk9RenNxeVQyVl9RMlRQQXFabktPUVVZZ2sxSThKU1doU05DTU5FcmdtTXM5T0dCRGk1Y2Q5Yk5ySmJPY2E0b1JQd2lkdld6ZWF1ck5fMmdxUDNNal9aVzh3MjVJaVBnYzFfUVBWUW0wLXU4d3NadXpfanlhdGo0YzFNMUtMakh2V3hJSmxrdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-025-02091-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has found that inhaled N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a fast-acting psychedelic compound, produced rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in people with treatment-resistant depression. Participants reported major reductions in depression and suicidal thoughts within a day of dosing, with benefits lasting up to three months. The therapy was safe, well-tolerated, and may offer a more accessible alternative to existing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DMT is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain plants and also produced in small amounts in the human body. It is best known as the main psychoactive ingredient in the Amazonian brew ayahuasca, but unlike ayahuasca, which requires co-administration of substances that prolong its effects, vaporized DMT acts quickly and clears the system within about 20 minutes. Because of its short duration and inhalation delivery, DMT has attracted interest as a potentially more scalable and less disruptive option for psychedelic therapy. The researchers aimed to investigate whether this compound could offer fast, lasting relief for people with depression who have not responded to traditional treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My team and I have been studying psychedelics, especially ayahuasca and DMT, for almost 20 years now,” said study author Draulio Barros de Araujo, a professor of neuroscience at the Brain Institute at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte and director of the Center for Advanced Medical Psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What caught our attention with vaporized DMT is how it offers such a deep and intense psychedelic experience in a very short window of time. We were curious to see whether such a brief intervention, when supported properly, could still make a meaningful difference for people struggling with treatment-resistant depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on individuals with treatment-resistant depression—a severe form of depression that does not improve after trying at least two different antidepressant medications. Fourteen adults were recruited through online ads, clinician referrals, and word-of-mouth. All met criteria for moderate to severe depression and had failed to respond to multiple prior medications. Participants received two doses of inhaled DMT in a controlled hospital setting: a lower dose of 15 milligrams followed by a higher dose of 60 milligrams about 90 minutes later. Both sessions occurred on the same day and were accompanied by preparation and integration support from trained clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants inhaled DMT using a medical-grade vaporizer. During the experience, they lay back in a quiet room with dim lighting and calming music while being monitored by a psychiatrist, psychologist, and nurse. The team measured participants’ vital signs, mood, and subjective experience before, during, and after the sessions. Clinical assessments took place immediately after dosing, then at 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that depression symptoms, measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), dropped significantly within 24 hours of treatment. On average, scores fell by 21 points—enough to shift many patients from a range of severe depression to mild or even minimal symptoms. About 79% of participants responded to the treatment by day 1, and 71% achieved full remission. By day 7, the response rate rose to nearly 86%, and more than half of participants remained in remission. Even after three months, 57% still showed a meaningful response and 36% remained in remission, despite receiving no further DMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the most surprising aspects was just how consistently strong the clinical response was, even though the DMT experience itself only lasts about 10 to 20 minutes,” De Araujo told PsyPost. “Many participants not only reported emotional breakthroughs during the session, but also experienced lasting changes in mood and outlook from just a single dose. That’s not something we typically see with most psychiatric interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to easing depressive symptoms, inhaled DMT also sharply reduced suicidal thoughts. Nearly 90% of participants had suicidal ideation at the start of the study, with almost half considered to be at severe risk. One day after treatment, no participants showed severe suicidal ideation. Improvements in suicidality were maintained in most participants through the 3-month follow-up. Notably, the reduction in suicidal thoughts closely tracked with improvements in mood, suggesting that the antisuicidal effect was related to the overall antidepressant impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjective reports indicated that the DMT experience was intense but generally positive. Participants described vivid imagery, altered perception, and insightfulness, with most rating the experience as pleasant. Physiological measurements showed temporary increases in blood pressure and heart rate shortly after dosing, similar to what might occur during moderate exercise, but no serious adverse events were reported. The most common side effects were throat irritation and coughing from inhalation, which resolved quickly. Headaches and mild discomfort were reported by some participants the following day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the intensity of the psychedelic experience did not predict treatment outcome. While some participants had mystical or highly visual experiences, the researchers found no strong statistical links between specific features of the trip and clinical improvements. This suggests that the therapeutic effects of DMT might not depend on achieving a particular type of altered state. However, one measure—complex visual imagery—did show a trend toward association with better outcomes, echoing past research on psychedelics like ayahuasca and psilocybin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most promising aspects of this treatment is its practicality. Unlike longer-acting psychedelics like psilocybin or LSD, which require several hours for each session, vaporized DMT produces its effects in about 20 minutes. The entire protocol—including screening, preparation, dosing, and integration—can be completed in a single day. This has important implications for making psychedelic-assisted therapy more affordable and scalable, especially in public health systems with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main takeaway is that even an ultra-short psychedelic experience, when delivered in a safe and supportive setting, can lead to rapid and sustained improvements in depression,” De Araujo said. “Perhaps most importantly, we saw a significant reduction in suicidal ideation in many participants within 24 hours, and those effects were still present months later. This suggests that DMT-assisted therapy might offer fast-acting relief, which could be especially valuable in urgent clinical situations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these results are encouraging, the study has limitations. It was open-label, meaning both participants and researchers knew they were receiving DMT, which raises the possibility of placebo effects. The sample size was small, and the findings need to be confirmed in larger randomized controlled trials. In addition, the researchers did not collect pharmacokinetic data to measure how much DMT was actually absorbed, which limits conclusions about dose-response relationships. Some participants had minor fluctuations in symptoms over time, and one experienced a relapse in suicidality, underscoring the need for follow-up care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was a Phase 2a open-label study, without a placebo group, and the number of participants was small,” De Araujo noted. “We have to be cautious in how we interpret the results.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will need to compare DMT directly with placebo or other treatments, test repeated dosing regimens, and examine how integration sessions contribute to long-term outcomes. Better understanding how individual differences—such as prior psychedelic use, expectations, or co-occurring medication—affect results will also help tailor treatments. Monitoring for rare but serious side effects, including cardiovascular changes, will be essential as researchers scale up trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From the beginning, our goal has been to develop a model of psychedelic-assisted therapy that fits within clinical, ethical, and economic boundaries,” De Araujo explained. “We believe that treatments that are overly long or expensive will face serious obstacles when it comes to integration into health systems, especially in countries like Brazil, where resources are limited and access is a real concern. In that sense, the vaporized DMT protocol we designed seems to strike a promising balance: it’s efficient, potentially scalable, and still therapeutically meaningful. Going forward, we aim to refine this model and test it in larger, controlled trials, always with a focus on safety, accessibility, and real-world feasibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is part of a larger movement, one that’s challenging old assumptions and inviting us to reimagine mental health care through the lens of altered states of consciousness. Psychedelics are not a magic bullet, but they can offer powerful tools when approached with scientific rigor, cultural sensitivity, and genuine care for the human experience. It’s been incredibly meaningful to witness how these experiences can reconnect people with themselves, and sometimes even bring hope back into view.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-025-02091-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Rapid and sustained antidepressant effects of vaporized N,N-dimethyltryptamine: A phase 2a clinical trial in treatment-resistant depression&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Marcelo Falchi-Carvalho, Fernanda Palhano-Fontes, Isabel Wießner, Handersson Barros, Raynara Bolcont, Sophie Laborde, Sérgio Ruschi B.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucid dreaming&lt;/strong&gt;, the phenomenon where dreamers become aware they are dreaming and can influence their dreams, is now recognized as a distinct state of &lt;strong&gt;consciousness&lt;/strong&gt;. Research led by &lt;strong&gt;Çağatay Demirel&lt;/strong&gt; from the Donders Center for Cognitive Neuroimaging at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands reveals that lucid dreaming is neither &lt;strong&gt;fully&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;wakefulness&lt;/strong&gt; nor typical &lt;strong&gt;REM sleep&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, it involves unique &lt;strong&gt;brain wave&lt;/strong&gt; patterns and neural activity that set it apart. This new understanding was published recently in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/45/20/e2237242025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and represents one of the most comprehensive analyses to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Brain Regions and Waves Behind Lucid Awareness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By analyzing an extensive collection of &lt;strong&gt;EEG&lt;/strong&gt; data from multiple studies, Demirel and his team identified &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/05/drinking-less-of-this-one-beverage-could-lower-your-dementia-risk-and-its-not-coffee/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="88533" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;specific brain regions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; linked to lucid dreaming. The right central lobe, &lt;strong&gt;parietal lobe&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;precuneus&lt;/strong&gt; all showed shifts in electrical activity during lucid dreams. &lt;strong&gt;Beta waves&lt;/strong&gt;—high-frequency brain waves associated with conscious thinking, &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/dinosaurs-closest-relatives-prove-they-can-think-study-finds-dumb-birds-are-actually-problem-solvers/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="80208" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;problem-solving&lt;/a&gt;, and decision-making—became prominent in the right temporal and parietal lobes. These areas are crucial for spatial awareness, nonverbal memory, and self-perception, explaining why lucid dreamers can recognize they are dreaming and exert cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside beta waves, &lt;strong&gt;gamma waves&lt;/strong&gt;, which are the fastest brain waves, also increased, particularly in the right precuneus. This brain area plays a key role in self-referential thinking—the process of reflecting on oneself. “When lucid dreaming begins, gamma waves increase in the right precuneus,” Demirel said, highlighting this neural signature as a hallmark of conscious awareness within dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Connectivity Patterns Distinguish Lucid Dreaming From REM Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study went beyond localized brain activity to explore&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/mouse-brain-map-compared-to-galaxy/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="85804" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;functional connectivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—the communication between different brain regions—during lucid dreaming. Researchers found that &lt;strong&gt;alpha band&lt;/strong&gt; connectivity (8–12 Hz) increased significantly during lucid dreaming compared to non-lucid REM sleep. Furthermore, interhemispheric and inter-regional gamma connectivity rose, suggesting widespread network engagement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the source level, the right central and parietal areas, including the temporoparietal junction, showed significant reductions in beta power during lucid dreaming. These neural dynamics reflect the complex processes underpinning changes in perception, &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/red-meat-may-be-destroying-your-memory/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="76105" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, and self-awareness. During initial signaling by lucid dreamers using eye movements, gamma1 power (30–36 Hz) spiked in the right temporo-occipital regions, further illustrating the brain’s dynamic engagement in this unique state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Parallels Between Lucid Dreaming and Psychedelic Experiences&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the brain activity observed during lucid dreaming resembles patterns seen with &lt;strong&gt;psychedelic&lt;/strong&gt; drugs such as LSD and ayahuasca. Both experiences involve alterations in the precuneus, a region critical to the sense of self and ego processing. However, while psychedelics often lead to a dissolution of ego and reduced self-referential processing, lucid dreaming appears to “harness elements of self-awareness and control,” as noted by Demirel and his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This comparison underscores lucid dreaming as an intriguing and complex mode of consciousness. It provides an altered but conscious state in which the dreamer maintains cognitive control and self-awareness, distinguishing it from both typical REM sleep and psychedelic-induced states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Decoding Consciousness Through the Study of Lucid Dreams&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings illuminate the electrophysiological correlates of lucid dreaming and help establish it as an independent state of consciousness. By pooling&lt;strong&gt; human EEG data&lt;/strong&gt; from multiple labs and applying an adaptive multistage preprocessing pipeline, Demirel’s team overcame previous challenges like small sample sizes and artifacts from eye movements. This rigorous approach allowed them to detect subtle yet distinct neural signatures at both sensor and source levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study advances understanding of how perception, memory, self-awareness, and cognitive control shift during lucid dreaming. As Demirel remarked, “This research opens the door to a deeper understanding of lucid dreaming as an intricate state of consciousness by pointing to the possibility that conscious experience can arise from within sleep itself.”&lt;/p&gt;

or battling type 2 diabetes are "often already depressed" without the medication, the doctor pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These conditions take a toll – physically, emotionally and socially," he said. "So, yes, a large portion of patients starting GLP-1 drugs are already dealing with mental health struggles. But that’s not because of the drug — that’s because of the disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/heres-why-belly-fat-more-common-we-age-ways-prevent" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Here's Why Belly Fat Is More Common As We Age, And 3 Ways To Prevent It;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Here's Why Belly Fat Is More Common As We Age, And 3 Ways To Prevent It&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once these individuals begin dropping weight, blood sugar stabilizes and energy improves, which usually lifts their mood as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GLP-1 drugs help people reclaim their health," Osborn noted.

"You need proper, randomized controlled trials to reach a conclusion, and better studies to determine whether this is related to the medication itself or just weight loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who are interested in these medications or are experiencing mood changes while taking them, the surgeon stressed the importance of keeping in close contact with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:medical providers.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;medical providers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just like any other medication, they can have potential side effects," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghanem recommended seeking out professionals and practices who take a "holistic approach" to weight loss, offering mental health support in addition to medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brunilda Nazario, MD, chief physician editor of medical affairs at WebMD, told Fox News Digital that "obesity is complicated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obesity specialists … are cautiously excited about how well these drugs work," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With current studies showing conflicting results on mood disorders and the use of GLP-1 drugs, it’s important for all doctors who prescribe these drugs to be aware and check the patient’s history before prescribing [them]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;"Don’t be afraid to ask for help if you feel something is not right — your health depends on it," one expert suggested.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nazario stressed that it's "vital" for GLP-1 RA users to listen to their bodies, urging them to pay attention to their feelings and know the symptoms of mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don’t be afraid to ask for help if you feel something is not right — &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:your health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;your health&lt;/a&gt; depends on it," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nazario noted that GLP-1 RAs can affect mood in many different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are not all negative — they have the potential to improve mood as well," she said.

But it often takes a bit of detective work to determine what, exactly, is causing these symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Abnormalities in blood pressure — including blood pressure that’s either too high or too low — can cause dizziness. Some people will experience heart palpitations, or extra heartbeats, that can trigger lightheadedness, Oen-Hsiao said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though many arrhythmias are benign and triggered by factors like caffeine or menopause, some irregular heartbeats — including those that occur at the bottom of the heart chamber — can be a sign of heart disease or a blockage in the heart arteries, according to Oen-Hsiao. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: FG Trade via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;FG Trade via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Neurological symptoms like headaches and dizziness could be a sign of cardiovascular problems.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Bad Headache &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A severe headache may be a marker that something’s amiss with the heart. A frontal headache with pain that shoots across the forehead and behind the eyes can indicate that a person has high blood pressure, according to Oen-Hsiao.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Some people don’t feel their blood pressure, but at one point, it gets a little too much blood pressure for their brain to handle and then they’ll get that frontal headache and pain behind the eyes,” Oen-Hsiao said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;High blood pressure resulting in a headache can be urgent issue, Tadwalkar said.

When the heart begins to fail, fluid can accumulate in the legs and belly.

&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;A study from earlier this year showed that staying active can keep your brain healthier&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sustaining physical activity throughout midlife also seems to have the best effect on reducing dementia risk,” the charity explains. One study showed that older people who exercised the least were more than twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s as the ones who exercised the most.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new study performed by scientists from University College London, published earlier this year, looked at &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/health" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; data from more than 450 people since their birth in 1946. The researchers analysed how physical activity patterns over three decades impacted brain health at the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/dementia-information/dementia-risk/physical-activity-and-dementia-risk/" rel="nofollow"&gt; &lt;u&gt;research&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/a&gt; found that being physically active, particularly before the age of 50, is linked to a larger hippocampus - which is the area of the brain mostly associated with memory. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who exercised throughout their life were less likely to experience cognitive decline, even if they had key markers of Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that staying active throughout your life, especially before turning 50, can help keep your brain healthy and delay early signs of Alzheimer's. This is especially true for women,” the study’s lead author, Dr Sarah-Naomi James, said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Tips to get more exercise include choosing an activity that you will enjoy, or using workout videos for motivation, &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/reduce-your-risk-of-dementia/physical-activity" rel="nofollow"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Alzheimer’s &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Society advised. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also suggested using a wearable device like a fitness tracker watch, or a smartphone app like the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; Couch to 5K to track progress, and joining a group activity like hiking as it is a “great way to connect and interact with people”. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Being active doesn’t have to involve going to the gym or running a marathon. You are more likely to do regular physical activity if you find things you enjoy doing,” &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/dementia-information/dementia-risk/physical-activity-and-dementia-risk/" rel="nofollow"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Alzheimer’s Research UK&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/a&gt; explained. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also suggested being active every day and trying to not spend too long sitting. It added: “If you have to, then break it up with movement or activity of any kind.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQWFkxb0VHb004cnFLWktxWTRhMWVBWC1RbmxvcnJfd0JxTTVFTEtXbWZucERHQklhRmswejNxLXZTVlNlUnZuM1J3WUVMd2FKbS1PTHZkTFg2V1RWRUc2OGFNUkhNV2dEanY0QTdDR0RyRDNLcE1OZllQMHdZLWMtTEtXN21pQQ</guid></item><item><title>吃1种水果，保护自己免受“沉默杀手”和痴呆症的侵害- Surrey Live | Protect yourself from 'silent killer' and dementia by eating 1 fruit - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxOSDYtTW9pLTRLMFlOQmwtVm0yNFU3LUdCbGtRYktsU0MtTm1MMEVobjdvMjI2M1pSWlhUaWlIdDFPZ2JQeWJJTHFuM1VpejJZZWRtMGZ2U05oTElaZVpacjBMMGtHZi1vUXpWVDNMZ0ZwTmlMdExzS2I2ZS1nT1BfZ3hIUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With heart disease being a top cause of death globally, experts suggest that one particular fruit might be one of the best weapons against it.

The study showed that these juicy berries may help delay cognitive decline and protect against dementia and Alzheimer’s due to their flavonoids, keeping the brain sharp as we age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do strawberries and polyphenols affect the heart?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strawberries are a good source of polyphenols, particularly anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, and ellagitannins. These are all types of antioxidants, granting a number of cardiovascular benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Polyphenols help increase 'good' cholesterol (HDL) and decrease the 'bad' kind (LDL), contributing to a healthier overall cholesterol balance. This 'good' cholesterol is needed in balance to help with crucial bodily functions, &lt;a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/medical/tests/blood-cholesterol" rel="nofollow"&gt;according to the British Heart Foundation (BHF)&lt;/a&gt;, such as the production of hormones and vitamin D, as well as helping with digestion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Polyphenols also help to reduce inflammation in blood vessels, further protecting our hearts from serious and potentially fatal problems like a heart attack or stroke. Some studies suggest that polyphenols can help regulate blood pressure, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840535/" rel="nofollow"&gt;according to a research paper on the NIH website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about strawberries and brain health?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plant compounds called flavonoids in strawberries may help to offset inflammation in the brain and delay age-related memory loss, potentially reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s in older adults.

			&lt;p&gt;More than &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34337138/"&gt;60 million people&lt;/a&gt; are estimated to be living with dementia, resulting in over 1.5 million deaths a year and an annual cost to the global healthcare economy of around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;US $1.3 trillion&lt;/a&gt; (almost £1 trillion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of scientific research and billions of pounds of investment, dementia still has no cure. But what of the old saying that prevention is better than cure? Is preventing dementia possible? And if so, at what age should we be taking steps to do so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite what many believe, dementia is not simply an unavoidable consequence of ageing or genetics. It is estimated that &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract"&gt;up to 45%&lt;/a&gt; of dementia cases could potentially be prevented by reducing exposure to 14 modifiable risk factors common throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these risk factors – which include things like obesity, lack of exercise, and smoking – are traditionally studied from middle age (around 40 to 60 years old) onwards. As a result, several of the world's leading health bodies and dementia charities now recommend that strategies aimed at reducing dementia risk should &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-midlife-approaches-to-reduce-dementia-risk/health-matters-midlife-approaches-to-reduce-dementia-risk"&gt;ideally be targeted at this age&lt;/a&gt; to reap the greatest benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(24)00191-0/fulltext"&gt;We argue&lt;/a&gt;, however, that targeting even younger ages is likely to provide greater benefits still. But how young are we talking? And why would exposure to risk factors many decades before the symptoms of dementia traditionally appear be important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain, let's work backwards from middle age, starting with the three decades covering adolescence and young adulthood (from ten to 40 years old).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many lifestyle-related dementia risk factors emerge during the teenage years, then persist into adulthood. For example, 80% of adolescents &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26696565/"&gt;living with obesity&lt;/a&gt; will remain this way when they are adults. The same applies to &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.122.19455"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01259-9/abstract"&gt;lack of exercise&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, virtually all adults who smoke or drink will have &lt;a href="https://ash.org.uk/uploads/Youth-Smoking-Fact-Sheet.pdf?v=1741882326"&gt;started these unhealthy habits&lt;/a&gt; in or around adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poses two potential issues when considering middle age as the best starting point for dementia-prevention strategies. First, altering health behaviour that has already been established is notoriously difficult. And second, most high-risk individuals targeted in middle age will almost certainly have been exposed to the damaging effects of these risk factors for many decades already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, the most effective actions are likely to be those aimed at preventing unhealthy behaviour in the first place, rather than attempting to change long-established habits decades down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The roots of dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about even earlier in people's lives? Could the roots of dementia stretch as far back as childhood or infancy? &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(23)00169-9"&gt;Increasing evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests yes, and that risk factor exposures in the first decade of life (or even while in the womb) may have lifelong implications for dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why this may be, it's important to remember that our brain goes through three major periods during our lives – development in early life, a period of relative stability in adult life, and decline (in some functions) in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most dementia research understandably focuses on changes associated with that decline in later life. But there is &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.084318"&gt;increasing evidence&lt;/a&gt; that many of the differences in brain structure and function associated with dementia in older adults may have at least partly existed since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in long-term studies where people have had their cognitive ability tracked across their whole lives, &lt;a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2318-7-28"&gt;one of the most important factors&lt;/a&gt; explaining someone's cognitive ability at age 70 is their cognitive ability when they were 11. That is, older adults with poorer cognitive skills have often had these lower skills since childhood, rather than the differences being solely due to a faster decline in older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXU8aVHF0gk?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar patterns are also seen when looking for evidence of dementia-related damage on &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(23)00169-9"&gt;brain scans&lt;/a&gt;, with some changes appearing to be more closely related to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/148/1/133/7695855"&gt;risk factor exposures in early life&lt;/a&gt; than current unhealthy lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, perhaps the time has come for dementia prevention to be thought of as a lifelong goal, rather than simply a focus for old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A lifelong prevention plan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do we achieve this in practical terms? Complex problems require complex solutions, and there is no quick fix to address this challenge. Many factors contribute to increasing or decreasing an individual's dementia risk – there is no "one size fits all" approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one thing generally agreed upon is that mass medication of young people is not the answer. Instead, we – along with 33 other leading international researchers in the field of dementia – recently published a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(24)00191-0/fulltext"&gt;set of recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for actions that can be taken at the individual, community and national levels to improve brain health from an early age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our consensus statement and recommendations deliver two clear messages. First, meaningful reductions in dementia risk for as many people as possible will only be achievable through a coordinated approach that brings together healthier environments, better education and smarter public policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second – and perhaps most importantly – while it's never too late to take steps to reduce your risk of dementia, it's also never too early to start.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255845/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

That trip allowed medical professionals to get to the root of the issue: lung cancer. Now, Gemmell is urging others to err on the side of caution when it comes to their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Go and see your doctor if you've got anything that you're concerned about – that's what a [doctor] is for," he told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/lung-cancer-doctors-say-early-35229827" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Mirror UK;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Mirror UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; "Go as soon as you can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finger clubbing, or nail clubbing, itself isn't a problem, per &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24474-nail-clubbing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. It's not painful and on occasion, it can occur without an underlying cause. However, clubbing is most often associated with lung cancer and infections, so it is worthwhile to be examined by a doctor, the clinic's post reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine if you have nail clubbing, you can conduct what's called the Schamroth window test, per &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/571916_2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medscape;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Medscape&lt;/a&gt;. Press two fingernails on opposite hands together and hold them up in front of you. If you can't see a sliver (usually a diamond shape) of empty space between your two fingers, there may be cause for concern.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of nail&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemmell shared his lung cancer journey in a testimonial for &lt;a href="https://roycastle.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, an organization for which he's a staunch advocate. He noted that he had no "common" signs of lung cancer, like breathlessness or restricted breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I googled it — as you do — and a respiratory problem flagged up," &lt;a href="https://roycastle.org/brian-gemmell/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:he wrote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "I went to my [doctor] and he sent me for a chest x-ray that same day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The x-ray technician then sought help from a radiographer, who sent Gemmell for a CT scan — which showed an "advanced tumour in my right lung," he wrote. The medical professionals surrounding Gemmell had differing opinions, but a surgeon insisted on removing his right lung completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemmell praised his doctor for his quick recognition of the symptom's cause, writing that his expertise coupled with his decisiveness "ultimately saved my life." However, awareness is just as crucial, Gemmell wrote, as doctors can only diagnose a problem if it's brought before them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People think lung cancer is a death sentence. That’s not surprising with the current survival statistics," Gemmell wrote. "But it doesn’t have to be. I’m proof that it doesn’t have to be. But it’s not going to just happen. The right people have to make it happen. They have to make it a priority."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/fingernails-clue-lung-cancer-symptoms-11736846" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 23:33:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBZbzNSZ20xWHJ2VFBFVUthb3JzSExxN051UUNEODJTYTdVeTdGNXVlc3BVZGJQd1E0NGhRNEluTTRUamNQNDN5RGZDMl9GOWQ4eU9pal8xSmNYaWdhQnI3QW5XcVRTbkNZQXFVUzF3SzQ2SEpoR3c</guid></item><item><title>科学家在月经期间发现全脑结构变化- ScienceAlert | Scientists Discovered Structural, Brain-Wide Changes During Menstruation - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNNWNKUjIwVzF6WFdBeHVveWdFeTdlanp6UWhHMGlJTGZsTm4ydW9MSnZTLVhRVUoxUVZGdFBLTmYwRTlxNldWb0VsNEtjbEFPOGZQVkpCVWpjZ19xYW15czZHT0xkQUFpdGdPZzkxOXc5eTZoM2trcWxMQVJLR2ZtOHJHeV9kRDVDTE9pcjFjcUxSenoxcy1OZ3dXTjlLdDFxWXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The constant ebb and flow of hormones that guide the menstrual cycle don't just affect reproductive anatomy. They also reshape the brain, and research gives us insight into how this happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by neuroscientists Elizabeth Rizor and Viktoriya Babenko of the University of California Santa Barbara, a team of researchers tracked 30 women over their menstrual cycles, documenting in detail the structural changes that take place in the brain as hormonal profiles fluctuate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results, published in a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.26785"&gt;peer-reviewed study&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, suggest that structural changes in the brain during menstruation may not be limited to those regions associated with the menstrual cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_142259" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142259" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/menstruation_cycle.jpg" alt="menstrual cycle diagram" class="wp-image-142259 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/menstruation_cycle.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/menstruation_cycle-600x364.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-142259" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Rujirat Boonyong/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results are the first to report simultaneous brain-wide changes in human white matter microstructure and cortical thickness coinciding with menstrual cycle-driven hormone rhythms," &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.26785"&gt;the researchers wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Strong brain-hormone interaction effects may not be limited to classically known hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-axis (HPG-axis) receptor-dense regions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menstruation typically means experiencing some 450 or so periods during the course of a lifetime, so it would be nice to know the different effects they can have on the body, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, although it is something that happens to half the world's population &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/menstrual-cycle/your-menstrual-cycle"&gt;for half their lives&lt;/a&gt;, research has &lt;a href="https://acmedsci.ac.uk/more/news/a-mans-world-how-healthcare-and-research-is-failing-women"&gt;been somewhat lacking&lt;/a&gt;. Who knows why. &lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/blog/2022/02/underfunding-of-research-in-womens-health-issues-is.html"&gt;Total mystery&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/womens-health-massively-underfunded-and-one-biggest-missed-opportunities-health"&gt;Seriously&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the research on the hormonal effect on the brain has been focused on brain communication during cognitive tasks, not the actual structures themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cyclic fluctuations in HPG-axis hormones exert powerful behavioral, structural, and functional effects through actions on the mammalian central nervous system," &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.26785"&gt;Rizor, Babenko, and their team noted&lt;/a&gt;. "Yet, very little is known about how these fluctuations alter the structural nodes and information highways of the human brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microstructure of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter"&gt;white matter&lt;/a&gt; – the fatty network of neuronal fibers that transfer information between regions of gray matter – has been found to change with hormonal shifts, including puberty, oral contraception use, gender-affirming hormone therapy, and post-menopausal estrogen therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_142255" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142255" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/white_matter_tracts.jpg" alt="white matter tracts in the brain" class="wp-image-142255 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/white_matter_tracts.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/white_matter_tracts-600x364.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-142255" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;White matter tracts connecting regions in the human brain. (Thom Leach/Science Photo Library)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address the menstruation gap in our understanding, the team took  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="161227" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scans of their subjects during three menstrual phases: menses, ovulation, and mid-&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24417-luteal-phase"&gt;luteal&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of each of these scans, the researchers also measured the participants' hormone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that, as hormones fluctuate, gray and white matter volumes change too, as does the volume of cerebrospinal fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, just before ovulation, when the hormones &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"&gt;17β-estradiol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22255-luteinizing-hormone"&gt;luteinizing hormone&lt;/a&gt; rise, the brains of the participants showed white matter changes suggesting faster information transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24638-follicle-stimulating-hormone-fsh"&gt;Follicle-stimulating hormone&lt;/a&gt;, which rises before ovulation, and helps stimulate the ovary follicles, was associated with thicker gray matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24562-progesterone"&gt;Progesterone&lt;/a&gt;, which rises after ovulation, was associated with increased tissue and decreased cerebrospinal fluid volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means for the person driving the brain is unknown, but the research lays the groundwork for future studies, and perhaps understanding the causes of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9132-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd"&gt;unusual but severe period-related mental health problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44294-024-00012-4"&gt;A separate study published in 2024&lt;/a&gt; by an international team of scientists found each phase of the menstrual cycle had a distinct influence over the brain as a whole, with changes across the brain and in specific regions found to also be related to an individual's age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although we do not currently report functional consequences or correlates of structural brain changes, our findings may have implications for hormone-driven alterations in behavior and cognition," &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.26785"&gt;the researchers wrote.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Investigation of brain-hormone relationships across networks is necessary to understand human nervous system functioning on a daily basis, during hormone transition periods, and across the human lifespan."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are reported in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.26785"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human Brain Mapping&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in October 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Up until now, physicians have mostly used costly, more invasive tests that involve puncturing the lumbar — known as a spinal tap — and brain scans that expose patients to radiation to confirm the presence of amyloid. The Lumipulse test takes a simple blood draw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MCBRK6J6V5HTVAUTDDV3PSJFKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Today’s clearance is an important step for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, making it easier and potentially more accessible for U.S. patients earlier in the disease,” Michelle Tarver, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UQHHXQXYNZENLBCA3ZTAQYK2JA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Competition is ramping&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;up among companies developing next-generation tests to diagnose Alzheimer’s, which afflicts nearly 7 million Americans.

Unlike the rapid signaling between neurons via neurotransmitters, this astrocyte-driven pathway unfolds over seconds to minutes, allowing for more flexible behavioral control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biochemical Circuit:&lt;/strong&gt; Astrocytes release ATP, which becomes adenosine to modulate neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slower Timescale:&lt;/strong&gt; This signaling operates over seconds to minutes, unlike fast neuron-to-neuron communication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting astrocyte pathways may open doors to treating psychiatric conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;HHMI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once thought to play a supporting function in the brain, new research shows non-neuronal astroglial cells perform a leading role in regulating the activity of neurons and their connections.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Janelia researchers uncovered the critical role of glial cells called radial astrocytes in controlling an important “giving up” behavior in zebrafish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found astrocytes act as a counter, telling a fish to stop swimming when it isn’t getting anywhere – a behavior crucial for survival. But scientists didn’t know how the astrocytes communicated with neurons to control this action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110035"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an astrocyte." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/astrocyte-behavior-ATP-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Previous research showed that when ATP is released extracellularly, enzymes convert it into adenosine – one of the components of ATP and a known neuromodulator in the brain. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Janelia and Harvard have now deciphered this conversation, revealing how astrocytes trigger a biochemical circuit that regulates neuronal activity and causes the fish to stop swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While neurotransmitters enable fast communication between individual neurons that lasts milliseconds, neuromodulators like the circuit uncovered in the new work act on populations of neurons to tune neuronal signals over timescales that are more than a thousand times slower, enabling flexible behavior on a timescale of seconds to minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work helps to uncover how such neuromodulators reach neurons and unveils a significant role for astroglia in neuromodulation. It also highlights the importance of including information about non-neuronal cells in research into how the brain works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the prevailing view is that a lot of the computations that are important for behavior come out of the patterns of connectivity between neurons,” says Alex Chen, a joint PhD student in the Ahrens Lab at Janelia and the Engert Lab at Harvard, who led the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work shows that we have to understand biochemical computations and other forms of non-neuronal information and combine it with information about the connections between neurons to really understand what the brain is doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how neuromodulators flow from astrocytes to neurons could also be important for treating psychiatric conditions, says Janelia Senior Group Leader Misha Ahrens, a senior author on the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Including these pathways more frequently in studies of psychiatric conditions makes a lot of sense,” Ahrens says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Knowing that a lot of the neuromodulation underlying brain function and dysfunction flows through astrocytes supports considering this new cell group as a potential therapeutic target.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncovering the conversation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work builds on the previous research from 2019, also led by the Ahrens Lab, which uncovered the role of radial astrocytes in the “giving up” behavior. That research found that as the fish realizes it isn’t getting anywhere, it swims harder, and astroglia activity ramps up. When astroglia activity reaches a threshold, the cells signal neurons in the fish to stop swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team discovered that neurons signal astroglia to ramp up their activity by releasing a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine, which triggers the astroglia to accumulate internal calcium. But they did not know how the astrocytes communicated back to neurons to cause the fish to stop swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new research, the team used a variety of sensors to figure out what molecules the astrocytes released when they were activated. They found that when calcium was elevated in astrocytes, ATP was released into the extracellular space between cells. Further, they showed that astrocytes, not neurons, released this ATP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ATP is widely known to be an energy-carrying molecule that fuels nearly all processes inside cells, it can also act as a signaling molecule on neurons through different types of receptors. However, when the researchers blocked these ATP receptors, they didn’t see any change in the zebrafish’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggested that the ATP released from the astroglia was not acting directly on the neurons but was instead broken down. Previous research showed that when ATP is released extracellularly, enzymes convert it into adenosine – one of the components of ATP and a known neuromodulator in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that when they blocked adenosine receptors on neurons, the giving up behavior was suppressed. That indicated that the extracellular pathway breaks down ATP into adenosine, which activates receptors on neurons that cause the fish to give up and stop swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was surprising to me because it seems like such an indirect pathway,” Chen says. “First of all, a non-neuronal cell is involved and then, second of all, there’s this biochemical circuit instead of some sort of neuronal circuit that implements this behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think this type of biochemical circuit allows for modulation to happen on a slower time scale, compared to the very fast time scales of neural circuits. The researchers also speculate that the enzymes that break down ATP could play an important role in signal transmission – potentially another target for therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/astrocytes-alertness-attention-28939/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;companion research&lt;/a&gt; led by researchers at Washington University in St. Louis shows that neuromodulation by norepinephrine in the hippocampus in mice also flows through astrocytes to influence communication between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A related pathway has been identified in flies, and recently published work has implicated a similar pathway in depressive-like behaviors in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent perspective by HHMI Investigator Cagla Eroglu also discusses these new findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These complementary studies raise the possibility that this pathway could potentially be at work in human brains and play an important role in brain function in both health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This pathway seems to be conserved across flies and fish and mammals, so it might be an evolutionary ancient circuit motif,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ddbfb2b0adb8a4b39db5b5b0b4f3b2afba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanci Bompey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hhmi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HHMI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Nanci Bompey – HHMI&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq5233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Norepinephrine changes behavioral state through astroglial purinergic signaling&lt;/a&gt;” by Alex Chen et al. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norepinephrine changes behavioral state through astroglial purinergic signaling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both neurons and glia communicate through diffusible neuromodulators; however, how neuron-glial interactions in such neuromodulatory networks influence circuit computation and behavior is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During futility-induced behavioral transitions in the larval zebrafish, the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) drives fast excitation and delayed inhibition of behavior and circuit activity. We found that astroglial purinergic signaling implements the inhibitory arm of this motif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In larval zebrafish, NE triggers astroglial release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), extracellular conversion of ATP into adenosine, and behavioral suppression through activation of hindbrain neuronal adenosine receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest a computational and behavioral role for an evolutionarily conserved astroglial purinergic signaling axis in NE-mediated behavioral and brain state transitions and position astroglia as important effectors in neuromodulatory signaling.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 21:53:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE92a09nbmFRWkNkTUp5bTBxbGVxSEw4OVVIc3VUcnk1UXZkdkhvVEt5T0VtMk5rOURPOXJBcHFoUlN3dU5haXY5VW9uSVNoUTA2YUdmUVd2MWhrdERvellRVl9VNkRwazVSN0M4</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，这种营养素可能有助于将代谢综合征风险降低21% - EatingWell | This Nutrient May Help Lower Metabolic Syndrome Risk by 21%, New Study Suggests - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTFBrcVRVeXhwWUFkYng4ejVmTl9XSXMxOWljZ2d2QjdjRXhWdS1FcGg3MVJDYUZxLXNqbEprM3J1RXNOQko1MlNrNmY5REduOUtpcGZMc1ZfQUZ6MlcxWE90SmlCUGxiZS1EY0Y5dm9lSGFQdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that magnesium may help prevent metabolic syndrome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions including high waist circumference and hypertension.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Metabolic syndrome has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium is an incredibly important mineral that your body relies on in order to perform a slew of functions and processes—over 600 of them, to be exact!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some of those processes include regulating muscle and nerve function, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-things-to-do-for-better-immune-health-8584490" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting a healthy immune system&lt;/a&gt;, maintaining steady heart rhythms and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-8737183" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;building strong bones&lt;/a&gt;. Magnesium also plays a crucial role in energy production and the synthesis of DNA and RNA, making it essential for overall health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One common health challenge connected to magnesium is metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome occurs when a person experiences at least three of five symptoms:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Having metabolic syndrome is linked to an increased risk for conditions like heart disease and diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some data shows that maintaining ideal levels—or sticking to healthy intake levels—might be linked to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fiber-intake-metabolic-disease-risk-research-8729291" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduced risk of developing metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There have been earlier efforts to understand how magnesium intake might be linked to the risk of metabolic syndrome, but many of these studies were based on single points in time, making it harder to see long-term patterns. Recently, however, more scientists have looked at the connection through longer-term studies. Using those studies, researchers compiled information in a detailed review and analysis to get a clearer picture of how magnesium intake and blood levels relate to metabolic syndrome, and these results were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To better understand the relationship between magnesium and metabolic syndrome, researchers carefully examined a large number of studies that focused on magnesium and metabolic syndrome. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To include studies in their analysis, the researchers only selected studies that were observational, focused on magnesium as a factor, looked at metabolic syndrome as the outcome and provided data on risk levels with confidence intervals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study included data from 16 studies with a total of 74,106 people and 20,044 cases of metabolic syndrome to examine how much magnesium people were eating. Additionally, 12 studies involving 21,827 people were analyzed to explore how magnesium levels in the blood relate to metabolic syndrome. The studies were conducted across several different regions, including the United States, Asia and Mexico, among others, and included participants aged 18 and older. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The findings showed that in studies where people's health was followed over time, higher magnesium intake was linked to a 21% lower chance of having metabolic syndrome. When looking at other studies that examined magnesium intake in groups at a single point in time, researchers saw a 39% lower odds of metabolic syndrome. Additionally, people with higher magnesium levels in their blood were also less likely to have metabolic syndrome, with the risk being almost cut in half.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers also checked if the results differed based on factors like gender or location. For women, the link between magnesium and a lower risk of metabolic syndrome was significant, but for men, it was less strong. Additionally, the connection was strongest in the United States, though differences by region or other factors like sample size weren't significant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are a few important limitations of this study that should be kept in mind. First, researchers couldn't perform a detailed analysis of smaller groups within the study because there weren't enough studies available. Second, there might have been some errors in measuring how much magnesium people consumed. Lastly, while most of the studies accounted for factors like energy intake, smoking, and alcohol use, there is always the possibility of other factors influencing the outcomes. It's important to consider these points when interpreting the findings.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; suggests that magnesium intake may be linked to metabolic syndrome risk, with greater intake offering a protective effect. This potential connection between magnesium intake and a lower risk of metabolic syndrome highlights just how impactful this mineral can be, especially in reducing your chances of conditions like metabolic syndrome and supporting your metabolic health. Generally, the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-take-too-much-magnesium-8683708" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;amount of magnesium healthy adults should be consuming daily&lt;/a&gt; ranges from 310 to 420 mg per day, depending on sex, age and pregnancy or lactation status.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

And between the variety of meats, eggs, beans, nuts, and so much more to choose from, there are a lot of options when it comes to sourcing protein. Unfortunately, though, an overconsumption of protein can actually sabotage your longevity efforts, says healthy aging expert Dr. Joseph Antoun. “Consuming excessive protein, particularly from animal sources, raises IGF-1 levels,” he says. “IGF-1, Insulin-like Growth Factor 1, is a hormone that plays a crucial role in growth and cell proliferation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But what’s the science behind the negative effects of eating too much protein? How is IGF-1 affected?

Foods that are high in animal protein—such as meat, eggs, and even milk—stimulate and increase our IGF-1 levels, meaning the more you eat, the more you’re at risk of increased IGF-1 levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“While it’s essential in childhood and for muscle repair, chronically elevated IGF-1 in adults has been linked to accelerated biological aging, and therefore, an increased risk of age-related conditions,” Dr. Antoun says. “I call this condition the ‘Diabetes of Protein,’ whereby high IGF is excessively aging the body way beyond what the muscles require.” You might notice these lasting impacts on excessively muscular figures, such as body builders, who look great during their peak but tend to age poorly in their 50s and 60s.

Around the mid-life period, however, disease formation begins and can slow down the natural processes of our body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You might be wondering &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; exactly you can eat to get your recommended daily intake of protein.

For example, you might turn your weekly grilled chicken rotation into a salad, where you’re getting more diverse nutrients than just animal protein. If you tend to eat a specific meat the most, consider replacing it with a plant-based protein like tofu, so you’re still getting the same textural experience while managing your IGF-1 levels. “A pure vegan diet is also correlated with longevity, but it needs to be supplemented with protein—especially at early and late stages of life,” Dr. Antoun adds.

In a new NIH-funded study, researchers identified key protein changes in spinal fluid that may serve as the first specific biomarkers for FTD in living patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These proteins point to problems in RNA regulation and neural connectivity, both crucial for healthy brain function. By analyzing inherited cases of FTD, researchers hope to develop earlier diagnostic tools that can direct patients into appropriate treatments and clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Clues Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Over 4,000 proteins analyzed revealed changes specific to FTD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Mechanisms:&lt;/strong&gt; Altered RNA regulation and brain connectivity may drive the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnostic Hope:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could lead to the first biomarkers for diagnosing FTD before symptoms worsen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia usually affects older people, so when it occurs in middle age, it can be hard to recognize. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common form is frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which is often mistaken for depression, schizophrenia, or Parkinson’s disease before the correct diagnosis is reached. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as part of an NIH-funded study, researchers at UC San Francisco have found some clues about how FTD develops that could lead to new diagnostics and get more patients into clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110031"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/FTD-biomarker-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These proteins, researchers think, could be the first specific markers for FTD that emerge as the disease develops in middle age.

All 116 patients had inherited forms of FTD, enabling researchers to study the disease in living people with confirmed diagnosis, something that isn’t possible in non-inherited FTD cases, which can only be confirmed after death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The composition of the proteins that changed in FTD suggest that these patients have problems with RNA regulation — required for the proper expression of genes in the brain — along with defects that affect connections in their brains. These proteins, researchers think, could be the first specific markers for FTD that emerge as the disease develops in middle age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“FTD affects people in the prime of their lives, stripping them of their independence,” said Rowan Saloner, PhD, professor in the UCSF Memory and Aging Center and corresponding author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But there’s no definitive way to diagnose it in living patients, unlike other dementias like Alzheimer’s disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we’re able to identify FTD early on, perhaps using some of the proteins we’ve identified, we can direct patients to the right resources, get them into the right therapeutic trials, and, ultimately, we hope, provide them with precision treatments.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients came from the ALLFTD Consortium, which is helmed by study co-authors Adam Boxer, MD, PhD, and Howie Rosen, MD, of UCSF, and Brad Boeve, MD, of the Mayo Clinic. Kaitlin Casaletto, PhD, professor in the UCSF Memory and Aging Center, is the senior author of the study.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Other UCSF authors are Adam Staffaroni, PhD, Emily Paolillo, PhD, Amy Wise, Hilary Heuer, PhD, Argentina Lario Lago, PhD, Julia Webb, Joel Kramer, PsyD, Bruce Miller, MD, Jennifer Yokoyama, PhD, William Seeley, MD, Salvatore Spina, MD, PhD, Lea Grinberg, MD, PhD, Lawren VandeVrede, MD, PhD, Peter Ljubenkov, MD, Suzan Lee, MD, and Julio Rojas, MD, PhD.

Another procedure, known as a spinal tap, which draws fluid from the spine, can also be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This blood test will allow primary care providers to start the diagnostic process, which is meaningful because patients typically wait months to be evaluated by a neurologist," Dr. Leah Croll, an assistant professor of neurology at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Positive test results will likely still require further testing, and a provider will need to rely on other clinical information to accurately diagnose a patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The main risk of the blood test is the possibility of a false positive or false negative, the FDA noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;False positives were also a concern for Croll. "The thought of Alzheimer's is enough to trigger significant levels of worry and distress," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;False negatives, on the other hand, may result in unnecessary additional testing and delays in treatment. The new blood test should not be intended as a stand-alone diagnostic test, the FDA said.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chronic inflammatory diseases contribute to more than half of deaths worldwide, according to the National Library of Medicine's resource, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493173/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;StatPearls&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Inflammation is a necessary process that occurs in your body to protect you from things like bacteria and viruses, and also helps you heal from injury. But when inflammation becomes long-term and doesn't go away, problems typically follow. Chronic inflammation is linked to conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, arthritis and other illnesses. And as the statistics show, it's alarmingly common.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thankfully, you have the power to keep inflammation at bay by being proactive with health habits, including how you nourish your body. You may have heard that a good way to do that is to avoid carbs. But nutrition experts disagree.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it's true that certain carbs can contribute to inflammation, not all carbohydrates are created equal. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Refined carbs&lt;/a&gt;, made with refined white flour, tend to be the main culprits.

While that doesn't mean you need to take all your favorite treats off the menu (we're not the food police!), it is important to focus on the better-for-you carbs that research shows can actually help &lt;em&gt;lower &lt;/em&gt;inflammation. These include whole grains like buckwheat, oats, quinoa and bulgur, and starchy vegetables like potatoes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 2022 systematic review published in&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8778110/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that replacing refined grains with whole grains can have a significant effect in reducing at least one inflammatory marker. Of the 31 studies the researchers looked at, they noted that the main nutrient in whole grains responsible for their anti-inflammatory benefits was dietary fiber, while other supporting nutrients like phytochemicals, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals also played a role.

For starters, it helps keep you fuller longer, which can help support a healthy weight. It also acts as a prebiotic, providing food for your beneficial gut bacteria, which helps them thrive and multiply. And a healthy gut microbiome helps lower inflammation throughout your body.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Culinary dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.justwendyjo.com/meet-wendy-jo/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wendy Jo Peterson, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, author of 10 cookbooks, including &lt;em&gt;Bread Making for Dummies&lt;/em&gt;, is an avid supporter of including whole grains in a balanced everyday diet. Peterson, who lives in Germany, says that the bulk of breads in Europe are made from ancient grains, like buckwheat, and contain more fiber than their wheat counterparts commonly found in the U.S. For example, according to the USDA, 100 grams of &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2512374/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;buckwheat flour&lt;/a&gt; contains more than three times the fiber of &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/790018/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;all-purpose wheat flour&lt;/a&gt; (10 grams versus 3 grams).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Peterson notes that this gluten-free seed also contains the phytochemicals rutin and quercetin—antioxidants known to reduce inflammation. A 2021 review published in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33357186/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infectious Disorders Drug Targets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; highlights the anti-inflammatory benefits of buckwheat alongside its potential neuroprotective, anti-diabetes and anti-hypertensive effects, among others. Antioxidants help protect your body against foreign invaders and the damage they can do to your body over time, which can lead to conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. Regular consumption of foods high in antioxidants can help prevent and also lower inflammation that contributes to disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All good reasons to add buckwheat to your diet. "Start by substituting half of the wheat flour with buckwheat in foods such as pancakes, waffles, crackers and tortillas," says Peterson. "Or, experiment with buckwheat groats as a delicious breakfast porridge."

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Social media can take even the most humble and help them go viral, which is what happened with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8032057/tiktok-high-fiber-scrambled-oats-recipe/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;TikTok oat trends&lt;/a&gt; in 2023. Oats are an affordable whole grain abundant in the diets of countless cultures. Not only are they shelf-stable and easy to keep on hand, but they make an excellent addition to both sweet and savory dishes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may be familiar with the cholesterol-lowering effects that the beta-glucan fiber present in oats offers. But oats may offer anti-inflammatory effects, too. They contain phenols that reduce free radicals in the body. Over time, these free radicals can lead to inflammation. Unfortunately, you're exposed to them every day, even if you exercise, eat a balanced diet and don't smoke, as they're just a part of life. But diets high in foods containing phenols may combat free radicals—essentially destroying them before they let inflammation set in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It found that the phenols in oats not only provide anti-inflammatory properties, but also have potent antioxidant, antiproliferative and anti-itching powers, as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A ½-cup serving of cooked oats provides 4 grams of filling fiber for just 150 calories, per the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2343973/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, it also delivers some iron, potassium, magnesium and zinc.

"The purple hue comes from a high concentration of antioxidants, namely phenols, anthocyanins and carotenoids, a trifecta powerhouse that helps rid the body of those free radicals mentioned above.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spelt is an ancient cousin of wheat that is widely used in German baking, according to Peterson. "It's lower in gluten than wheat flour, but still contains gluten. While spelt is not suitable for those living with celiac disease, people with wheat intolerances can often tolerate spelt," says Peterson. Though it's still important to talk to your healthcare practitioner if you'd like to try spelt and have a wheat intolerance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spelt is a great way to make every bite count, with a ½ cup of cooked spelt providing 4 grams of fiber and just over 125 calories, according to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/169746/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're interested in trying spelt, Peterson recommends purchasing spelt flour or spelt berries to gain the benefits of fiber and nutrients. If you'd like to try spelt berries, they can be cooked and prepared much like farro. If you want to start baking with spelt flour, she recommends starting by swapping in half spelt flour for half of the all-purpose flour in recipes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_72-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not only do you not have to avoid carbs if you're looking to keep inflammation under control, but eating the right kind of carbs can actually help &lt;em&gt;reduce&lt;/em&gt; inflammation. Focus on including a variety of nutrient-rich sources, like buckwheat, oats, purple potatoes, sorghum and spelt, as part of your anti-inflammatory eating plan.

&lt;p&gt;Another Falcon 9 launch Friday morning provided a morning wakeup call from &lt;a href="http://www.vandenberg.spaceforce.mil"&gt;Vandenberg Space Force Base&lt;/a&gt; as officials reveal some details of a trailblazing study into rocket-related noise. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two-stage Falcon 9 rocket lifted off at 6:43 a.m. Friday with 26 &lt;a href="http://www.starlink.com"&gt;Starlink&lt;/a&gt; satellites on board. Approximately an hour later, &lt;a href="http://www.spacex.com"&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the satellites had deployed.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the second Falcon rocket launch from Vandenberg the week and the 18th for the SpaceX vehicle from the Santa Barbara County site in 2025.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A boost in launch activity plus complaints and  concerns about noise led to what Vandenberg officials dubbed “a groundbreaking research collaboration.”

&lt;p&gt;Previous research on acoustic shock waves is substantial, but mostly centered on aircraft, military officials said.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, rocket launches create more complex sonic boom patterns due to a unique flight path, rapid acceleration, and extreme altitude changes.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a significant focus area for us. As we safely move launches further east to open access to operational orbits, we’re encountering new challenges, such as the phenomenon of sonic booms during ascent along the coast of California,” said Col. Mark Shoemaker, commander of Space Launch Delta 30, the primary unit at the base. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This situation presents opportunities for research, and we’re currently working on modeling these effects to better understand and account for them in operational planning,” Shoemaker said. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the &lt;a href="http://www.spaceforce.mil"&gt;U.S. Space Force&lt;/a&gt;, the effort had included &lt;a href="https://www.byu.edu"&gt;Brigham Young University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.csub.edu"&gt;California State University Bakersfield&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.faa.gov"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt;, SpaceX, and &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about launch acoustics and sonic booms. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collaborative sonic boom study has monitored 11 launches with plans to track more throughout 2025.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involves a network of approximately 25 high-tech monitoring stations spread across 500 square miles. The various stations have been positioned from the beaches between Isla Vista and Malibu to the hills of Ojai to capture  information about what experts have dubbed the complex sonic boom patterns created by rockets in flight.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Santa Barbara County residents know, launches of the same rocket from the same site at Vandenberg still can generate varying levels of sound.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like trying to catch lightning in a bottle,” said Kent Gee, Department of Physics and Astronomy at Brigham Young University, who leads the academic research team.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various factors affecting the noise includes the launch trajectory, rocket size, and atmospheric conditions, Gee said. 




&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Launch Readiness Review conducted by Vandenberg officials and aerospace contractors ahead of each mission analyzes the data models to predict likely noise impact.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a launch, the team uses data collected from the monitoring stations to validate predictions and possibly implement actions to reduce potential disturbance. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a delicate balance,” Shoemaker said. “Every adjustment we make has ripple effects. Fly too far west, and it could compromise our ability to get satellites into the required orbit. Fly too far east, and there might be increased noise in populated areas. But we’re committed to collecting data, following the science, and optimizing operations.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vandenberg commanders say the data collected could lead to implementing measures to reduce impacts from noise.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Base leaders have already taken other steps such as limiting middle-of-the-night liftoffs when possible. Departure times for rocket launches are decided based on where satellites need be placed in space. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of rocket launches has increased as government agencies craft smaller satellites to create more flexibility. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple commercial firms, such and Starlink and Amazon, also have created mega-constellations to provide internet access, communication and other services from space.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday’s liftoff marked the 125th mission for SpaceX Falcon from Space Launch Complex-4 at Vandenberg, SpaceX said. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Falcon 9 rocket launch may occur as a soon as Monday from the West Coast site.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vandenberg also plans to conduct an unarmed Minuteman III missile test launch between 12:01 and 5:01 a.m. Wednesday. ICBM test launches occur from underground silos dotting the northern section of Vandenberg.

They cross oceans inside cargo ships, set up vast super-colonies, and push out native species on six continents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-many-ants-live-on-earth-at-any-point-in-time-total-number-is-astounding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nest of ants&lt;/a&gt; settles in, homeowners and farmers often reach for poison baits, yet the insects lose interest before enough of them carry the toxic treat back home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that a tiny splash of caffeine could keep the party going – and give pest managers an edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research shows that moderate doses of caffeine sharpen an ant’s memory for the bait’s location. Ants that sipped a caffeinated sugar drop found it again more quickly on later trips, leaving a stronger scent trail for nest-mates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery points to a low-cost tweak that might finally turn the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ants-perform-life-saving-amputation-surgeries-on-injured-nest-mates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;invader’s own teamwork&lt;/a&gt; against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tiny-ant-huge-impact"&gt;Tiny ant, huge impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Argentine ant (&lt;em&gt;Linepithema humile&lt;/em&gt;) is only about one-tenth of an inch long, yet its cooperative spirit builds super-colonies stretching thousands of miles along the Mediterranean coast and the U.S. West Coast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those armies displace local insects, rob hummingbird feeders, and even short-circuit electrical gear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent economic analyses peg the global cost of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ants-are-shifting-to-new-habitats-to-cope-with-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;invasive ants&lt;/a&gt; – including crop losses and control bills – at billions of dollars each year. No wonder pest crews keep searching for smarter tactics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-giving-caffeine-to-ants"&gt;Giving caffeine to ants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out, researchers set up a miniature arena: a Lego drawbridge led each ant onto a letter-size acrylic platform where a single sugar drop waited. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some drops carried no additive, while others contained 25 parts per million (ppm), 250 ppm, or 2 000 ppm of caffeine. One hundred forty-two ants took part, and each explorer tackled the course four times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea with this project was to find some cognitive way of getting the ants to consume more of the poisonous baits we put in the field,” says the study’s first author Henrique Galante, a computational biologist at the &lt;a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Regensburg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automated cameras tracked every step, logging travel time and the straightness of each path. Without caffeine, the insects wandered, needing the same span to reach the treat on every attempt. Add a modest stimulant, and the story changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caffeine-gives-ant-focus-not-speed"&gt;Caffeine gives ant focus, not speed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that intermediate &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/caffeine-evolution-in-plants-the-surprising-story-of-yerba-mate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;doses of caffeine&lt;/a&gt; actually boost learning – when you give them a bit of caffeine, it pushes them into having straighter paths and being able to reach the reward faster,” Galante explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, ants that tasted 25 ppm caffeine shaved 28 percent off their foraging time on every return. Those on 250 ppm cut the clock by 38 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picture an individual that spent 300 seconds during its first outing – it would need just 113 seconds after three more trips on the lower dose and 54 seconds on the medium dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/caffeine-consumption-may-lower-the-risk-of-dementia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The stimulant&lt;/a&gt; did not act like an energy drink. There was no uptick in raw speed. “What we see is that they’re not moving faster, they’re just being more focused on where they’re going,” Galante noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that they know where they want to go, therefore, they have learned the locations of the reward.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only path geometry tightened; pace stayed the same. At the heaviest 2 000 ppm dose – the level that kills half of honeybees in tests – the learning advantage disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sharper-trails-deadlier-bait"&gt;Sharper trails, deadlier bait&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argentine ants rely on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ants-are-now-using-cars-to-travel-spread-to-new-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pheromone highways&lt;/a&gt;. A worker that discovers food drags its stinger along the ground, laying a chemical breadcrumb trail that guides the next shift. Faster relearning multiplies that effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to make them better at finding these baits, because the faster they go and come back to them, the more pheromone trails they lay, the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/evolutionary-deja-vu-the-symbiotic-relationships-of-trees-and-ants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;more ants will come&lt;/a&gt;, and, therefore, the faster they will spread the poison in the colony before they realize it’s poison,” Galante continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding caffeine could also slash the waste that now limits bait stations. In neighborhoods and orchards, technicians often replenish gels every few days because the first wave of foragers gives up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A caffeinated lure might stay attractive long enough for queens and larvae to receive a lethal serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-next"&gt;What happens next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is already field-testing the recipe at infested sites in Spain. They also plan to check whether caffeine interacts with common active ingredients such as hydramethylnon or spinosad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lowest dose we used is what you find in natural plants, the intermediate dose is similar to what you would find in some energy drinks, and the highest amount is set to be the LD50 of bees – where half the bees fed this dose die – so it’s likely to be quite toxic for them,” Galante notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selecting a concentration that boosts memory without harming pollinators will be crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine’s appeal extends beyond Argentine ants. Other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dirt-ants-were-once-masters-of-disguise-in-the-caribbean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;invasive species&lt;/a&gt; – including fire ants and big-headed ants – share the same food-sharing habits that make baiting tricky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the stimulant nudges their neural circuits in a similar way, managers could deploy a single additive across multiple pest fronts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-learned-about-ants-and-caffeine"&gt;What we learned about ants and caffeine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, caffeine improves ants’ overall focus and learning without increasing speed, allowing them to navigate straighter paths and lay stronger pheromone trails. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effect boosts the effectiveness of bait traps, leading more ants to the poison and increasing the chances of it spreading through the colony. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the benefit peaks at moderate doses – very high levels eliminate the learning advantage and can be toxic. So, overall, caffeine makes ants better at foraging and sharing, which ironically makes them more vulnerable to well-designed pest control strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the message is simple: a dash of coffee in the buffet may turn an army’s fabled navigation skills against itself.

He is now making his return to acting after a five-year absence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from the journal Neurology shows the increase in Parkinson's cases and deaths in the US from 1990 to 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Parkinson's Foundation estimates 1.2million Americans will be diagnosed with Parkinson's by 2030, and 90,000 are struck by the disease every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a 50 percent increase from the previously estimated rate of 60,000 a decade ago, the foundation estimates.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe environmental factors could partly be to blame for the rise of Parkinson's disease in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in Minnesota, for example, found &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13856205/Doctors-environmental-cause-Parkinsons-young.html"&gt;exposure to the pollutant particulate matter&lt;/a&gt;, PM2.5, raised the risk of Parkinson's disease by 36 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14687307/popular-food-parkinsons-disease-link-doctor-urgent-warning.html"&gt;study published earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; also found consuming at least 11 servings of ultraprocessed food in a day increased the risk of early Parkinson's symptoms by damaging dopamine-producing neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are roughly 35,000 deaths per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for Parkinson's disease, but medications and other treatments can help replace lost dopamine and keep symptoms at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common, Levodopa, crosses the blood-brain barrier to convert itself into dopamine, controlling balance issues and tremors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fox has previously said he takes Levodopa, though it's unclear if he still takes it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2015, the actor underwent deep brain stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a surgical procedure that involves making small holes in the brain and implanting electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using a device on the chest resembling a pacemakers, electrical zaps get sent through the electrodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Parkinson's disease, it has been shown to interrupt faulty nerve signals in the brain, controlling movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fox is also seen in his 2023 documentary 'Still' working with a physical therapist on walking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Johns Hopkins, physical therapy can help Parkinson's patients improve balance and coordination, as well as stiffness and rigidity caused the lack of dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms of Parkinson's include uncontrollable tremors, slow movements and muscle stiffness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fox is pictured in 1985's 'Back to the Future,' six years before his Parkinson's diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One of Fox's last roles was as Louis Canning in the 2012 season of 'The Good Wife,' pictured here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also has used speech therapy, as Parkinson's disease damages muscles responsible for speaking and swallowing. This therapy may have helped him maintain the ability to speak and recite lines for acting jobs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though it's unclear if Fox has received experimental or newer treatments, his foundation has helped &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-5323269/Michael-J-Fox-pledges-100-000-UK-university-develop-Parkinson-s-app.html"&gt;fund several of the newest Parkinson's therapies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include a different form of deep brain stimulation called adaptive deep brain stimulation, which adapts electrical impulses in real-time based on symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means it can sense and adjust when a patient's brain activity changes, offering a more personalized approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adaptive deep brain stimulation was just approved by the FDA for Parkinson's in February and is expected to be widely available later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Michael J Fox Foundation has also funded two medications placed under the tongue and inhaled that are meant to 'rescue' Parkinson's patients during 'off' episodes and quickly alleviate symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both drugs are currently being reviewed by the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 20:31:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNV20zRTRmWWFLbHMyZWpUVHpTd09mU3p5UWl1a2VxTm1LblZzZVdDMWpHdTZ3NDEwQ3NHaEl5RUc4cG84RV9kMW8zSHQwYW5KdGVnQ29MU1NtdjN3Tl9IT2MxZVdFa3U4aWdaMlAyajlCTVp1cm56ZUsyVkM0dllNRFd0WDdRS215a3BNbktqbUdFSGZzR3EtaFR3SWvSAaIBQVVfeXFMUGdXRkNMQ2J3THRtc0JGN1RZVGRzbG9KelVQQy0tdEh3U3BNV3p1WjkyMm1zcW9WQ1NCTVFSM1NERGhYbERKQjZ5aGZFWVltanhfMThUSHZKUjQ2NTB5N0lFaFNuRXV4TjRXaUx6OWhMWUMteHFFNGJPRFdUVFVBZlFYbDhLM1V5cjRrX1hDa1JyS3BTOG5YcmNSQmpBOS16QVN3</guid></item><item><title>彻底改变肥胖症治疗：科学家发现大脑对抗饥饿的秘密武器- SciTechDaily | Revolutionizing Obesity Treatment: Scientists Discover the Brain’s Secret Weapon Against Hunger - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPc3F4b3I2d3ZUbDhUSkJySDc3c0xtWUs1RWVMVFpmQWdfakd5Q2I4Sk9fT0xzYmoycVExZV8tTkZiNnRjT0djODNfNlh5MXZ4dWNreUNmTVJLd1NvUm56eDM2VnlnNW5xdzVYZlBKNlRQVlhGenAxQU1YVWkwb0FZMHF1dV9fYTdRbjFWTzFwRGtYc2dLTkMyT1pmOHpldVVOSEVPekY1VHo5bWNVejFJRS1Ld1BSeWQ2LWVv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 20:23:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPc3F4b3I2d3ZUbDhUSkJySDc3c0xtWUs1RWVMVFpmQWdfakd5Q2I4Sk9fT0xzYmoycVExZV8tTkZiNnRjT0djODNfNlh5MXZ4dWNreUNmTVJLd1NvUm56eDM2VnlnNW5xdzVYZlBKNlRQVlhGenAxQU1YVWkwb0FZMHF1dV9fYTdRbjFWTzFwRGtYc2dLTkMyT1pmOHpldVVOSEVPekY1VHo5bWNVejFJRS1Ld1BSeWQ2LWVv</guid></item><item><title>单剂量的5-MeO-DMT改变大脑中的基因表达并减少应激小鼠的焦虑样行为- PsyPost | Single dose of 5-MeO-DMT alters gene expression in brain and reduces anxiety-like behavior in stressed mice - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizAFBVV95cUxOR1kzc0U1VTlaaC1OOFE5WmhGUFZCQURYeC1PX0h6RkNZNDAtNUhIQnRPWGYzZm1vc09QcWdZeS1jN3BkanVMdWI3WW9nN2J4VTdyX1dkTk9UUTVCZHNZZ1RwNlZjRm9wMU5kQXJZcDBTdEFKaV9fYUVrZ3ZqZGtDWXpTemduSTRVY19PR0JSRnFBZlV0R3NvLU9DaWREb2VRd0tKblNBU2NHWVlxaUdGOHVFSVlTVm9mZ2x1NkJmN3U0SVlTQnA4b1g4S2U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02655-w" target="_blank"&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that the fast-acting psychedelic compound 5-MeO-DMT can reduce anxiety-like behavior in stressed mice while altering the expression of genes linked to neural activity in specific brain regions. The research found that a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT modified expression of immediate early genes and affected behavioral responses up to five days later, offering insights into how this compound might work at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5-MeO-DMT, short for 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, is a powerful psychedelic substance structurally related to DMT. It occurs naturally in certain plants and the venom of the &lt;em&gt;Incilius alvarius&lt;/em&gt; toad and has recently drawn attention for its rapid, intense, and short-lived psychological effects. In clinical settings, 5-MeO-DMT has been explored for its potential to treat depression, anxiety, and addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compound is known to engage serotonin receptors in the brain, but unlike other psychedelics such as LSD or psilocybin, it binds more strongly to the 5-HT1A receptor, which is commonly linked to anti-anxiety effects. Despite growing interest, little is known about the biological changes it induces in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand how 5-MeO-DMT affects the brain and behavior, researchers at the Brain Institute of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte in Brazil administered a single high dose of 5-MeO-DMT to male mice and analyzed both their gene expression and behavioral responses. The team focused on brain regions involved in anxiety and emotion, including the anterior cingulate cortex, the basolateral amygdala, and the ventral hippocampus. These areas are part of a larger network that regulates fear, emotional responses, and stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved multiple groups of mice. Some received a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT and were euthanized at different time points—one hour, five hours, or five days later—so their brain tissue could be analyzed using laser capture microdissection and quantitative PCR to measure levels of gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined several genes known to be involved in synaptic plasticity and neural activity, including Arc, Zif268, BDNF, CREB, NR2A, mTORC1, TRIP8b, and NFkB. Another set of mice was tested for anxiety-like behaviors using two common experimental tools: the elevated plus maze and the open field test. A third group underwent a stressful restraint procedure to test how 5-MeO-DMT affects behavior under acute stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main findings was that 5-MeO-DMT caused significant changes in the expression of immediate early genes—especially Arc and Zif268—in the anterior cingulate cortex, basolateral amygdala, and ventral hippocampus. These genes are rapidly activated in neurons and are involved in learning, memory, and synaptic remodeling. One hour after treatment, Arc expression increased in the anterior cingulate cortex and basolateral amygdala but decreased in the ventral hippocampus. Zif268 was upregulated only in the basolateral amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five hours after treatment, the researchers observed a decrease in the expression of NR2A, a gene linked to glutamate signaling, in the ventral hippocampus. This was notable because NR2A has been associated with excitatory synaptic activity and learning processes. Interestingly, no significant changes were observed in the expression of several commonly studied plasticity-related genes, such as BDNF or CREB, at any time point. This suggests that 5-MeO-DMT may exert its effects through less conventional molecular pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five days after treatment, the only significant long-lasting change was an increase in the expression of TRIP8b in the ventral hippocampus. This gene helps regulate ion channels involved in controlling the excitability of neurons and has been implicated in mood regulation and antidepressant effects. No changes were seen in the dentate gyrus or for other genes at this later time point, suggesting that the effects of 5-MeO-DMT on gene expression are both region-specific and transient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, mice treated with 5-MeO-DMT showed mixed results. In the elevated plus maze, which measures willingness to explore open, unprotected spaces, mice treated with 5-MeO-DMT five days earlier entered open arms more frequently than saline-treated mice, suggesting reduced anxiety. However, in the open field test, those same mice entered the exposed central area less often, a behavior typically associated with increased anxiety. This discrepancy raised questions about whether 5-MeO-DMT has context-dependent behavioral effects or whether it affects general locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To clarify these findings, the researchers examined mice subjected to a stress challenge. When mice received 5-MeO-DMT five days before undergoing a 20-minute restraint stress, they showed significantly lower baseline levels of corticosterone, the primary stress hormone in rodents. After stress, these mice spent more time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze and in the center of the open field arena—both considered signs of reduced anxiety-like behavior. These results suggest that 5-MeO-DMT can increase resilience to stress, possibly by modifying the stress hormone system and related neural pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional behavioral analysis looked at specific exploratory actions, such as head dips over the edges of the maze. Across different groups, mice treated with 5-MeO-DMT showed more unprotected head dips and fewer protected ones, a pattern consistent with reduced anxiety. These effects were seen both in non-stressed mice and in those that had undergone stress, reinforcing the idea that 5-MeO-DMT influences anxiety-like behavior over an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has several limitations. It focused only on male mice, so it’s unclear whether the results apply to females. The researchers also measured only mRNA levels and not the actual proteins produced by the genes. Since many biological effects depend on protein activity, future studies will need to explore whether changes in gene expression translate into functional protein-level changes. Additionally, while the researchers chose a single high dose based on previous work, dose-response effects were not tested in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that serotonergic psychedelics can produce long-lasting effects on brain function and behavior after just one administration. In particular, 5-MeO-DMT appears to act through non-traditional pathways, possibly involving its high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor or its interactions with other targets like the sigma-1 receptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02655-w" target="_blank"&gt;Serotonergic psychedelic 5-MeO-DMT alters plasticity-related gene expression and generates anxiolytic effects in stressed mice&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Margareth Nogueira, Daiane C.

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark chocolate, tea, apples, and grapes can significantly lower blood pressure, especially in people with hypertension, with effects comparable in size to standard medications.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;These flavan-3-ol-rich foods also improve blood vessel function, offering heart health benefits beyond just blood pressure reduction.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Whole foods work better than supplements, and they come with minimal side effects, making them a safe, affordable addition to a heart-healthy lifestyle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GUILDFORD, England — &lt;/strong&gt;Instead of buying the next trendy expensive supplement or exotic superfood, a morning cup of tea could do more for your blood pressure than you realize. A new international study suggests that certain foods, like tea and dark chocolate, pack enough cardiovascular punch to rival prescription medications—at least for people who need them most.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed 145 clinical trials involving over 5,000 participants and found that foods rich in compounds called flavan-3-ols can slash blood pressure by amounts comparable to many hypertension drugs. In people with high blood pressure, consuming these foods daily dropped their readings by about 6 points systolic (the top number) and 3 points diastolic (the bottom number), similar to what doctors see with standard medications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/eurjpc/zwaf173/8092214?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, examined foods that most Americans already know and love: &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/7-health-benefits-dark-chocolate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dark chocolate&lt;/a&gt;, tea (both green and black), apples, and grapes. Unlike studies that test isolated compounds in lab settings, this analysis looked at actual foods people can easily incorporate into their daily routines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/best-teas-for-high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Blood pressure benefits&lt;/a&gt; weren’t the only good news. These foods also improved how well blood vessels function, measured through a test called flow-mediated dilation, which is how well arteries expand when blood flows through them. This effect occurred regardless of blood pressure changes, suggesting that flavan-3-ols might offer cardiovascular protection beyond just lowering the numbers on a monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

(George Rudy/Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team combed through medical databases for studies published between 1946 and 2024. They included only randomized controlled trials, the gold standard for medical research, that tested flavan-3-ol-rich foods against &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-finds-insomnia-placebos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;placebos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bigger-benefits-for-those-who-need-it-most"&gt;Bigger Benefits for Those Who Need It Most&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trials varied widely in design and duration, from single-dose studies measuring immediate effects to longer trials lasting up to 26 weeks. Participants ranged from healthy volunteers to people with existing &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cardiovascular-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/hypertension/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;. This diversity actually strengthens the findings, showing that benefits appear across different populations and health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Breaking down the effective doses, the average intervention delivered 586 milligrams of total flavan-3-ols daily. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/dark-chocolate-superfood-boosts-mood-memory-immunity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dark chocolate studies&lt;/a&gt; typically used about 56 grams (roughly two ounces) of chocolate with 75% cocoa content. Tea studies provided around 700 milliliters (about three cups) daily. Apple studies used about 340 grams, roughly two medium apples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that blood pressure benefits were most pronounced in people who needed them most. Those with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/whats-your-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;normal blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; saw minimal changes, but people with elevated readings or diagnosed hypertension experienced significant drops. This mirrors how prescription blood pressure medications work; they’re most effective in people with higher baseline readings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also examined isolated compounds versus whole foods. Studies using purified epicatechin (the main flavan-3-ol in cocoa) or EGCG (common in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/green-tea-may-be-essential-to-conquering-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;green tea&lt;/a&gt;) showed weaker effects than studies using actual chocolate or tea. This suggests that the benefits come from the complex interplay of compounds in whole foods, not just single active ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flow-mediated dilation improved by about 2% on average. This might sound small, but research has shown that every 1% improvement in this measure corresponds to a 10% reduction in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/periodontitis-gum-disease-cardiovascular-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across all studies, only 0.4% of participants reported adverse effects, mostly minor &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/best-tea-for-upset-stomach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stomach upset&lt;/a&gt; or headaches that resolved on their own. Many medications, on the other hand, often come with significant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, the American Heart Association and similar organizations recommend &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/too-much-salt-energy-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;limiting sodium&lt;/a&gt;, increasing physical activity, and following dietary patterns like the Mediterranean diet to manage blood pressure. Actively including specific flavan-3-ol-rich foods could be equally important, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-simple-addition-to-heart-healthy-lifestyle"&gt;Simple Addition to Heart-Healthy Lifestyle&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One thing the researchers note is that food-based sources may appear safe, but high-dose supplements might interact with medications or cause &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/liver/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;liver problems&lt;/a&gt;. They recommend prioritizing whole foods over supplements, especially for people taking other medications.&lt;/p&gt;

(Photo by Laårk Boshoff on Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For people with diabetes, the news was less encouraging. The analysis found no consistent &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; benefits in studies focusing solely on diabetic participants. People with diabetes might need different approaches or higher doses to see effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While not a replacement for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/prescription-drugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;prescribed medications&lt;/a&gt; or medical advice, including more flavan-3-ol-rich foods in a daily routine could be a valuable addition to a healthy lifestyle, especially for those with higher blood pressure. These are findings that, although promising, require ongoing investigation,” says lead study author Christian Heiss from the University of Surrey, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only evidence of the benefits of flavan-3-ols. The massive COSMOS trial, published in 2022, followed over 21,000 people and found that cocoa flavanol supplements reduced &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/multivitamins-supplements-dont-prevent-heart-attacks-stroke-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular death&lt;/a&gt; by 27%. Combined with this new analysis showing comparable blood pressure effects to medications, the case for including these foods in heart-healthy diets becomes increasingly compelling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A daily square of dark chocolate or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/drinking-tea-dementia-alzheimers-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cup of tea&lt;/a&gt; costs far less than most blood pressure medications, which can run hundreds of dollars per month. For the average person, that daily cup of tea or piece of dark chocolate might be one of the easiest and most enjoyable ways to support cardiovascular health. Just remember to choose dark chocolate with at least 75% cocoa content and count those calories as part of your overall diet. Your blood pressure, and your taste buds, will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching PubMed for randomized controlled trials published between 1946 and 2024 that examined flavan-3-ol-rich foods’ effects on blood pressure and blood vessel function. They analyzed 109 publications containing 145 separate trials with 5,205 total participants. The studies tested various flavan-3-ol sources including cocoa products, tea, apples, grape extracts, and isolated compounds like epicatechin and EGCG. Interventions ranged from single doses to daily consumption for up to 26 weeks, with participants including healthy individuals and those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daily consumption of flavan-3-ol-rich foods (averaging 586 mg total flavan-3-ols) significantly decreased office blood pressure by 2.8/2.0 mmHg systolic/diastolic overall, with much larger effects in people with elevated blood pressure or hypertension (5.9/2.7 mmHg). 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed similar patterns, dropping 3.7/2.6 mmHg overall and 6.8/5.1 mmHg in hypertensive individuals. Flow-mediated dilation improved by 2.0% after single doses and 1.7% with chronic consumption, independent of blood pressure changes. Effects were strongest with cocoa products and tea, while isolated compounds showed weaker benefits than whole foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed considerable variability between studies that couldn’t be fully explained by investigated factors, limiting evidence strength to “moderate” quality. Many studies were relatively short-term (average 6.6 weeks), leaving questions about long-term sustainability. Not all studies reported flavan-3-ol content consistently, and measurement methods varied. Only participants with diabetes showed no significant blood pressure benefits. The analysis was limited to English-language studies from PubMed, potentially missing relevant research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This research was funded by an unrestricted research grant from Lipton Teas &amp;amp; Infusions. Two co-authors work for food companies (Unilever and Lipton), creating potential conflicts of interest. To address this, independent academic authors validated the analyses and reviewed the manuscript. Additional funding came from British Heart Foundation fellowships for some researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;This week, Spotify rushed to remove hundreds of obviously fake podcasts found to be marketing prescription drugs in violation of Spotify's policies and, likely, federal law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Business Insider (BI) &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-takes-down-podcasts-peddling-drugs-opioids-2025-5"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Spotify removed 200 podcasts advertising the sale of opioids and other drugs, but that wasn't the end of the scandal. Today, CNN &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/16/tech/spotify-removing-drug-sales-podcasts"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that it easily uncovered dozens more fake podcasts peddling drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the podcasts may have raised a red flag for a human moderator—with titles like "My Adderall Store" or "Xtrapharma.com" and episodes titled "Order Codeine Online Safe Pharmacy Louisiana" or "Order Xanax 2 mg Online Big Deal On Christmas Season," CNN reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Spotify's auto-detection did not flag the fake podcasts for removal. Some of them remained up for months, CNN reported, which could create trouble for the music streamer at a time when the US government is cracking down on illegal drug sales online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Multiple teens have died of overdoses from pills bought online," CNN noted, sparking backlash against tech companies. And Donald Trump's &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china/"&gt;aggressive tariffs&lt;/a&gt; were specifically raised to stop deadly drugs from bombarding the US, which the president declared a national emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BI found that many podcast episodes featured a computerized voice and were under a minute long, while CNN noted some episodes were as short as 10 seconds. Some of them didn't contain any audio at all, BI reported.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmar3ofqw002k3576qhizq284@published"&gt;Instead of not making a big deal of it, she is doing the exact opposite. She freaked out and demanded to know who “taught” him to do it, and even wants to send him to a therapist to find out if he was sexually abused by someone. I’ve explained to her that what he did is completely normal for a kid his age; I was masturbating by the time I was 11! However, she is insisting he sees a counselor “just to make sure.”&lt;/p&gt;

Let her know that it is &lt;a href="https://www.mottchildren.org/posts/your-child/masturbation-and-young-children"&gt;normal for children to start playing with their genitals&lt;/a&gt; as early as babyhood, and that by the age of 15, nearly 100 percent of all boys have masturbated. Remind her of your own experiences and explain that a child doesn’t have to have been exposed to anything inappropriate to take an interest in self-pleasure; they literally discover that touching themselves feels good on their own. Try to convince her to apologize to your son for her overreaction, so that he doesn’t feel shame about what he’s done. If she’s unwilling to do that, take him to the side and tell him yourself that she was simply freaked out and wrong. Fight the therapy ideas tooth and nail; if there are some other actual issues about which you think he should talk to someone, then fine. Otherwise, making him go to therapy for masturbating will likely make him think poorly about both therapy and masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmar3ogjl002r3576rgryfgpt@published"&gt;I have an issue with my mother. Whenever I do something wrong and upset her, her first reaction is always to bring up the fact that when I get older, and my parents are dead and I have no one left, I will realize the value of their words. I understand that, and it’s probably true, but the thing that bothers me is her insensitivity. I do not think she realizes how much her words hurt me or maybe she doesn’t care, even though I have explained this to her. When I get upset over what she said, she acts like I am overreacting and that &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/02/worst-fear-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;what I did to make her say that was a terrible offense.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; has identified taurine, a naturally occurring amino acid, as a critical factor in the growth of certain types of leukemia, &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/a-downside-of-taurine-it-drives-leukemia-growth" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/a-downside-of-taurine-it-drives-leukemia-growth"&gt;according to researchers&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Rochester’s Wilmot Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;The findings could lead to new treatments for myeloid cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;These aggressive blood cancers all originate in the bone marrow, where the research shows cancer cells depend on taurine from their environment to grow and survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Led by Jeevisha Bajaj, Ph.D., the Wilmot team discovered that leukemia cells cannot produce taurine on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-read-more" class="taboola-read-more"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Instead, they use a transporter to absorb taurine from the surrounding bone marrow microenvironment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;By using genetic tools to block this uptake in both mouse models and human cell samples, scientists were able to stop leukemia growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;“We are very excited about these studies because they demonstrate that targeting uptake by myeloid leukemia cells may be a possible new avenue for treatment of these aggressive diseases,” said Bajaj, assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Genetics and a member of Wilmot’s Cancer Microenvironment research program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;The study adds to growing evidence that metabolism—how cancer cells get energy—is just as important as genetic mutations in driving cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-read-more-8" class="taboola-read-more-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Researchers found that once inside leukemia cells, taurine promotes glycolysis, a process that breaks down glucose for energy and supports cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;“This study is one of the first to show that taurine may actually help drive cancer growth,” Bajaj said. “Leukemia cells hijack taurine to fuel their survival.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Jane Liesveld, M.D., a Wilmot oncologist and co-author of the study, urged caution regarding taurine supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;The amino acid, also found in the brain, heart, and muscles, is a common ingredient in energy drinks, protein powders, and certain foods such as meat, fish, and eggs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Cancer patients sometimes take it to ease chemotherapy side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;“Dr. Bajaj’s work shows that local levels of taurine in bone marrow may enhance leukemia growth, suggesting caution in use of high-dose taurine supplementation,” Liesveld said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Researchers emphasized that more work is needed to understand the role taurine plays in cancer development and resistance to treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;Bajaj said one of the next steps is to study taurine levels in patients with leukemia and to develop methods for safely blocking taurine from entering cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gVSBJn body-paragraph"&gt;“Since taurine is a common ingredient in energy drinks and is often provided as a supplement to mitigate the side effects of chemotherapy, our work suggests that it may be of interest to carefully consider the benefits of supplemental taurine in leukemia patients,” the authors wrote in their conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods are associated with a rogues' gallery of health problems, including elevated risk for obesity, dementia, type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="161606" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite experts' warnings, ultra-processed foods are satisfying, cheap, and easy, making them popular across much of the world. In the US, more than &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316624011258?via%3Dihub"&gt;half of all calories&lt;/a&gt; adults consume at home now come from ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As researchers race to keep up, the list of suspected risks continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an international team of researchers who analyzed decades of records from tens of thousands of health workers, people who eat a lot of ultra-processed foods are more likely to have early signs of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="161606" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease than those who don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not prove causation, but it does reveal a noteworthy association, especially in the broader context of health concerns related to ultra-processed foods. It also adds to mounting evidence that diet is key to brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Eating a healthy diet is crucial as it has been associated with a lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases, and the dietary choices we make today can significantly influence our brain health in the future," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/5257"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; co-author Xiang Gao, a nutritional epidemiologist with the Institute of Nutrition at Fudan University in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers focused on signs of Parkinson's disease that appear before more specific symptoms develop, which can include body pain, constipation, depressive symptoms, excessive daytime sleepiness, and an impaired sense of smell. &lt;span&gt;At this stage, while patients may not have characteristic features of the disease, neurodegeneration may have already begun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's growing evidence that diet might influence the development of Parkinson's disease. Our research shows that eating too much processed food, like sugary sodas and packaged snacks, might be speeding up early signs of Parkinson's disease," Gao &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/5257"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a longitudinal analysis using data from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, letting them track details about the diet and health of nearly 43,000 people for up to 26 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sample included men and women with an average age of 48 years, who had no history of Parkinson's disease. The subjects had received regular medical exams and completed biennial health questionnaires, which Gao and his colleagues reviewed for early signs of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects also submitted responses to surveys at two- to four-year intervals, offering insight into their dietary habits. Researchers used this to estimate each subject's average daily ingestion of ultra-processed foods, as defined by the Nova classification system for food processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study covered several types of ultra-processed foods, including sauces, spreads, or condiments; artificially or sugar-sweetened beverages; packaged savory snacks; packaged sweets; snacks or desserts; yogurt or dairy-based desserts; and animal-based products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161680" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161680" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Froot-Loops-Cereal-Bowl.jpg" alt="a bowl of Froot Loops breakfast cereal, a common example of ultra-processed foods" class="size-full wp-image-161680" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Froot-Loops-Cereal-Bowl.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Froot-Loops-Cereal-Bowl-542x415.jpg 542w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Froot-Loops-Cereal-Bowl-600x460.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161680" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Froot-Loops-Cereal-Bowl.jpg"&gt;Evan-Amos/Wikimedia Commons/CC0 1.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjects were split into five groups based on their consumption of ultra-processed foods. Those in the highest group ate 11 or more servings per day on average, while the lowest group averaged fewer than three daily servings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers adjusted for factors such as age, alcohol intake, body mass index,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="161606" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; intake, physical activity, and tobacco smoking, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects who ate 11 or more daily servings of ultra-processed foods were 2.5 times likelier to have at least three early signs of Parkinson's disease compared with subjects who ate fewer than three servings per day, the authors report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher consumption of ultra-processed foods was linked with increased risk of almost all early signs of Parkinson's disease used in this study, they found, with the exception of constipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some important caveats to these findings. They show an association between ultra-processed foods and increased risk for early signs of Parkinson's disease, but more research is needed to clarify the nature of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus on early signs of Parkinson's disease also involves some ambiguity, as the authors acknowledge, since these are potential hints of the condition rather than definitive indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the early signs – body pain, for example, or daytime sleepiness – are common as people age and don't necessarily herald Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these features considered in composite, however, are "strongly predictive" of subsequent Parkinson's disease diagnoses, the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Choosing to eat fewer processed foods and more whole, nutritious foods could be a good strategy for maintaining brain health," Gao &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/5257"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"More studies are needed to confirm our finding that eating less processed food may slow down the earliest signs of Parkinson's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213562"&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Rabies can also be found in other wild animals, including raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rabies is a preventable disease that can be fatal if not treated properly,” said Alpesh Patel, Chief Epidemiologist for the Will County Health Department. “Bats are often the most common carrier of rabies. We want our residents to be informed of the potential dangers of rabid animals and stay away from bats and any wild or unfamiliar animal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rabies is a deadly virus that affects the brain and nervous system. Rabies can spread to people and pets through the bites and scratches of an infected animal. Rabies can also be contracted when saliva from a rabid animal comes into contact with a person’s eyes, nose, mouth, or an open wound. If someone wakes up to find a bat in the room, that is also considered an exposure even if they cannot identify a bite. A bat’s teeth are small, and a bite mark may not be visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you discover a bat in your home, do not kill or release the bat. Instead, immediately consult with your local animal control to determine appropriate next steps. If you have been bitten by a bat or any wild animal, seek immediate medical attention. Animal bites may also become infected with bacteria. Rabies preventive treatment, if needed, must begin within a few days of exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An animal does not have to be aggressive or exhibit other symptoms to have rabies. Changes in any animal’s normal behavior can be early signs of rabies. A bat that is active during the day, found on the ground, or is unable to fly is more likely than others to be rabid. Such bats are often easily approached but should never be handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Department of Public Health offers the following tips can help prevent the spread of rabies:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not touch, feed, or unintentionally attract wild animals with open garbage cans or litter. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never adopt wild animals or bring them into your home. Do not try to nurse sick wild animals to health. Call animal control or an animal rescue agency for assistance. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teach children never to handle unfamiliar animals, wild or domestic, even if they appear friendly. “Love your own, leave other animals alone” is a good principle for children to learn to reduce the risk of exposures to rabid animals. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain homes and other buildings so bats cannot get inside. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a bat is in your home, do not release the bat outdoors until after speaking with animal control or public health officials. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After consulting with animal control or public health officials, the bat may need to be captured for rabies testing to determine if you need preventive treatment or if your pet may have been exposed. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steps you can take to capture the bat if animal control is not available:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the bat lands, approach it slowly, while wearing thick gloves, and place a box or coffee can over it. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slide a piece of cardboard under the container to trap the bat inside. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tape the cardboard to the container securely, and punch small holes in the cardboard, allowing the bat to breathe and call animal control. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can find more information about rabies and how to prevent exposure at the Illinois Department of Public Health website: &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/diseases-a-z-list/rabies.html" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/diseases-a-z-list/rabies.html&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1747505099294000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1lzylfHPyePqvr4huA_wu5" rel="nofollow"&gt;Rabies (illinois.gov)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 18:27:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOTmtOOWlwQzFEWGZhN2U1RVppYzBva2l5VU1wYmJFY3RxMmJUVGh0dGU0WERKa3hpazFiUHBEMEhYX0hYX2llWkMxaW5FRy15bjg4cER1TmUyZnBMTmV5dVNocVVnWU5kR2F1ZHJJcnF3d1Vsb25WYV8wOEprZ1VwSTNOek14bEJWSjBfbjRn0gGnAUFVX3lxTE93Qi1jOThvQkktY1E5cUQ4STZkZ0JiRk4wUDFlb1Y5akNDbGVVZTNCc1ZpOElyeUxCLXU0Z3ExelFQZDlfaUYwanVSRGlkY1lBRUVydzRidGpKTlkyZ0g5ZTdzZ015XzZ4OFduYy1QYUpLN28zaXYtbXdEbm53bEtwbmFhaWlMZWdJYlJ5UXFrM243Ynp0LTlCUmo1cFpTSEd6aGNyYk00</guid></item><item><title>新的研究指出，肠道5-羟色胺是治疗抑郁和焦虑的潜在方法- PsyPost | New research points to gut serotonin as a potential way to treat depression and anxiety - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxPcXBnS0gyaGxEZ2UxaVJrcDRUcV84UDZoSTQzWk5Yak04YkdMMktiU19KWE51RVpQT1BxdjAxU28zOElnRnBKY211aGRVM3NVb3FBMlpYMk50ZDZtVkl6cmFsdDhiQWwwOUtWYmQtaVJmWVdyLTBCSURWTWVZVUVqNmlUempwRHhBeTBCOHB1Tmc3b3RFdzFUaFpSb0M2X0RuYk93QlRmWXUwUlQ5dXNYRUx3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2024.11.012" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Gastroenterology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides evidence that serotonin in the gut lining may play a key role in regulating mood—and could open the door to safer antidepressant treatments, especially for pregnant women. In a series of experiments with mice and a large human birth cohort, researchers found that increasing serotonin in the intestinal lining reduced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. But they also discovered that exposing developing babies to serotonin-targeting antidepressants in utero was linked to a much higher risk of constipation in early life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Mark Ansorge at Columbia University and Kara Margolis at New York University, was motivated by a longstanding puzzle in mental health care. While drugs like Prozac and Zoloft are widely used and effective for many people with anxiety and depression, they can cause unwanted side effects—especially gastrointestinal issues. And when used during pregnancy, they cross the placenta and affect fetal brain and gut development. Despite this, exactly where in the body these medications work to improve mood has remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether the gut might be a key player in the antidepressant response, the researchers used genetic techniques to delete a specific serotonin transporter protein (SERT) only in the intestinal lining of mice. This transporter is responsible for clearing serotonin, a chemical that helps regulate mood, from the space between cells. Removing the transporter boosts serotonin levels in the gut. The team created two groups of mice: one with SERT removed from birth, and another where SERT was deleted only in adulthood using an inducible system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then put these mice through a battery of behavioral tests designed to assess anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, including how much time they spent exploring new environments, their willingness to eat in unfamiliar situations, and how much time they spent immobile when suspended by the tail—a common sign of despair in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice lacking intestinal SERT, whether from birth or adulthood, showed less anxious and less depressive behaviors. They explored more, showed fewer signs of hesitation, and were more active than control mice. Importantly, this mood-improving effect depended on communication between the gut and brain. When the researchers surgically disrupted the vagus nerve—the main information highway between the gut and brain—the benefits disappeared. This suggested that serotonin in the gut lining influences mood by sending signals to the brain via the vagus nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the researchers wanted to understand whether reducing serotonin in the gut might have the opposite effect. In another set of experiments, they used genetically modified mice that couldn’t make serotonin in the gut and also tested a drug that blocks serotonin production without being absorbed into the bloodstream. In both cases, the animals showed more anxiety-like behavior. This further confirmed the role of gut serotonin in regulating mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, targeting serotonin in the gut did not appear to harm cognition or gut motility, which are often affected by systemic antidepressant use. The researchers found no major changes in learning and memory tests, and gut function remained mostly normal—though there were subtle changes in the speed of intestinal movements when the transporter was deleted from birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human part of the study involved over 400 mother-child pairs enrolled in a Canadian birth cohort. The researchers followed up with mothers who either used antidepressants during pregnancy, experienced depression without medication, or had no mental health issues. They found that babies exposed to antidepressants in the womb were about three times more likely to develop functional constipation in their first year of life compared to babies who were not exposed. Constipation is a common type of gut-brain interaction disorder, and the finding adds to concerns about how these drugs may affect the developing gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results are consistent with earlier animal studies showing that systemic serotonin blockers can lead to abnormal development of the nervous system in both the brain and the gut. By focusing on the gut lining specifically, the new study offers a potential workaround: targeting serotonin only in the intestine may relieve symptoms of depression and anxiety without causing unwanted side effects or affecting fetal development during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Antidepressants like Prozac and Zoloft that raise serotonin levels are important first-line treatments and help many patients but can sometimes cause side effects that patients can’t tolerate. Our study suggests that restricting the drugs to interact only with intestinal cells could avoid these issues,” said Ansorge, an associate professor of clinical neurobiology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these findings are promising, the authors stress that pregnant individuals should not stop taking prescribed antidepressants without consulting a doctor. Untreated depression and anxiety can pose serious risks to both the mother and child. Instead, the researchers hope their findings will lead to new antidepressant medications that work only in the gut and avoid entering the bloodstream—especially during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larissa Takser, a pediatrician and co-author based in Quebec, noted the implications: “At the age of one, 63% of children exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy experienced constipation, compared with 31% of children whose mothers did not take medication. This finding suggests a potential connection between serotonin levels in utero and gut development, and opens new doors to examine SSRI properties not previously studied.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are already working on next-generation antidepressants that would be delivered in a way that keeps the drug in the intestine, reducing systemic exposure. “Our findings indicate that we may be able to treat a mother’s depression or anxiety effectively without exposing the child,” Ansorge said, “and we are working on drug delivery technology that will hopefully help us achieve that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margolis emphasized that the study is not intended to change clinical practice today. Instead, it is a call for more research on how antidepressants affect the gut, especially during development. “These are not clinical guidelines,” she said. “Rather, they are a call that more research is needed on the connection between SSRIs, serotonin, and the gut. It’s recommended that mothers and providers together consider treatment options that have been shown to be successful, including medications and cognitive behavioral therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research adds to growing interest in the gut-brain connection—a field that has revealed how gut bacteria, immune signals, and hormones interact with the nervous system. The idea that mood can be regulated from the gut opens new opportunities to improve mental health with fewer risks. If future clinical trials confirm these findings, we may see a new class of antidepressants designed to work where most of the body’s serotonin is made—not in the brain, but in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2024.11.012" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Intestinal epithelial serotonin as a novel target for treating disorders of gut-brain interaction and mood&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Lin Y.

              &lt;p&gt;The grim reaper can sometimes take decades to catch up with its victims. In a report out this week, scientists describe a woman who died from an incurable prion disease caught roughly 50 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors detailed the unusual case in a paper &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/6/24-1519_article"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The 58-year-old woman developed a form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) likely contracted through contaminated human growth hormone (HGH) treatments she received as a child, they determined. The tragic death may represent the longest latency period ever documented for this universally fatal disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disease-causing prions are one of the strangest things that can sicken people. They’re the misfolded form of the normal (but still very mysterious) prion protein found in our bodies and brains. When a rogue prion comes across its harmless counterpart, it converts the latter into a misfolded copy of itself, much like a zombie outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over time, the exponential accumulation of bad prions destroys the brain, leading to symptoms like dementia and death soon after. If that’s not scary enough, prions are naturally resistant to most standard methods of sterilization used to kill off other infectious agents like bacteria or viruses. The one saving grace is that prion diseases in general remain very rare, though other prion-like diseases like &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/alzheimers-disease-transmissable-human-growth-hormone-1851206087"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; are more common.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Prions can emerge sporadically for no clear reason, can be caused by inherited mutations, or they can be transmitted though close contact with infected bodily fluids or brain matter. In the 1980s, for instance, doctors discovered that people could catch CJD through human growth hormone extracted from prion-infected cadavers. A decade later, we learned that people could also catch CJD via tainted beef from cows infected with their own version of prion disease (nicknamed mad cow disease).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The discovery of HGH-related CJD quickly led to the end of cadaver-sourced HGH in the U.S. and other countries (thankfully, synthetic HGH became available soon after). Still, over two hundred cases of iatrogenic CJD—iatrogenic meaning it was caused by a medical treatment—from tainted HGH have been documented worldwide. Most of these cases were reported between five and 10 years after people had used HGH. But prion disease can sometimes take much longer to manifest in certain people, even decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to this latest report, the woman first visited doctors with tremors and trouble balancing. As is often the case, once symptoms started, her condition rapidly worsened. She was hospitalized just four weeks later, and several days into her stay, she fell into a coma that she would never awaken from.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;An autopsy confirmed the woman’s death from CJD but ruled out known genetic causes. And since she received HGH treatment prior to the cadaver ban, it was likely the root source of her illness, the doctors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HGH is used to treat severe growth-related conditions in children, and is typically taken over many years, including in this case. That makes it impossible to know exactly when the woman contracted CJD. Her first treatment was 51.3 years prior to her symptoms appearing, for instance, while her last treatment was 42.1 years earlier. But the U.S. switched to a different method of collecting HGH from cadavers in 1977, one that inadvertently and greatly reduced the risk of prion contamination. Based on that, the most likely timeframe for her infection is around 48.3 years earlier, the authors calculated.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There are known cases of people dying from CJD infections caught over &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/prion-disease-can-lurk-in-your-brain-for-30-years-befor-1823628617"&gt;30 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(06)68930-7/abstract"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of other prion diseases emerging over a half century later. But this appears to be the longest case of HGH-related CJD documented so far, though it might not be the last.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers note that genetics can influence a person’s chances of developing prion disease. And the woman possessed a mutation in the gene that codes for the prion protein linked to longer latency periods. So while tainted human growth hormone hasn’t caused CJD for a very long time, some people out there may still one day succumb to their earlier exposure (it’s estimated that around 7,700 people in the U.S. took HGH prior to the cadaver ban).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The authors say that doctors treating neurological illness should at least be on the lookout for these delayed cases, especially if their patients have a history of HGH treatment before 1977.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Although the US iCJD outbreak has slowed substantially, the potential for new cases remains,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the boy's fourth month, researchers were meeting with the Food and Drug Administration to discuss regulatory approval for a clinical trial—a trial where KJ would be the only participant. They were also working with the institutional review board (IRB) at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia to go over the clinical protocol, safety, and ethical aspects of the treatment. The researchers described the unprecedented speed of the oversight steps as being "through alternative procedures."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In month five, they started toxicology testing in mice. In the mice, the experimental therapy corrected KJ's mutation, replacing the errant A-T base pair with the correct G-C pair in the animals' cells. The first dose provided a 42 percent whole-liver corrective rate in the animals. At the start of KJ's sixth month, the researchers had results from safety testing in monkeys: Their customized base-editing therapy, delivered as mRNA via a lipid nanoparticle, did not produce any toxic effects in the monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clinical-grade batch of the treatment was readied. In month seven, further testing of the treatment found acceptably low-levels of off-target genetic changes. The researchers submitted the FDA paperwork for approval of an "investigational new drug," or IND, for KJ. The FDA approved it in a week. The researchers then started KJ on an immune-suppressing treatment to make sure his immune system wouldn't react to the gene-editing therapy. Then, when KJ was still just 6 months old, he got a first low dose of his custom gene-editing therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Transformational”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the treatment, he was able to start eating more protein, which would have otherwise caused his ammonia levels to skyrocket. But he couldn’t be weaned off of the drug treatment used to keep his ammonia levels down (nitrogen scavenging medication). With no safety concerns seen after the first dose, KJ has since gotten two more doses of the gene therapy and is now on reduced nitrogen scavenging medication. With more protein in his diet, he has moved from the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile in weight to 35&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; or 40&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile. He's now about 9 and a half months old, and his doctors are preparing to allow him to go home from the hospital for the first time. Though he will have to be closely monitored and may still at some point need a liver transplant, his family and doctors are celebrating the improvements so far.&lt;/p&gt;

Seems like America has jurisdiction on things outside its borders,' Shatner explained on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;William Shatner called on President Donald Trump to issue an executive order to restore Pluto's status as a planet in our solar system&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shatner also took issue with scientists refusing to honor a public vote that chose the name Vulcan for one of Pluto's moons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The actor cited Trump's ability to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America while making the case for the White House to strip scientists of their naming privileges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shatner is one of many people who still feels Pluto was undeservingly kicked out of our family of planets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has publicly agreed with the screen legend on this issue, writing on X in 2021: 'Pluto is a planet. Fight me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his fiery post, the sci-fi star declared that the scientists in charge of astronomical research were 'just a bunch of corrupt nerds on a power trip' and said it was time for Trump to end their 'tyranny of the cosmos.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shatner spent Thursday night sparring with fans on X and suggested that Trump should step in make Pluto a planet again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He even called on Musk, the so-called 'first buddy,' to convince Trump to sign an executive order giving Pluto back its status in the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a surprising turn for the actor, who recently criticized Trump for his continued attempts to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14685859/William-Shatner-Trump-Canada.html"&gt;purchase his home country&lt;/a&gt; of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a recent interview with Bill Maher, the Shatner was baffled by the results of the 2024 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't know why Democrats lost.

Former NASA chief Jim Bridenstine, Elon Musk, and William Shatner have all supported the cause of giving Pluto its planetary status back &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tyson, an astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York, has been a strong supporter of demoting Pluto from its status as a planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Pluto is not only different from the other planets, it's part of a whole new family of objects,' he argued in his book The Pluto Files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Shatner has some major support in this controversy, including the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-7653569/NASA-chief-Jim-Bridenstine-says-Pluto-planet-AGAIN.html"&gt;former head of NASA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2019, Jim Bridenstine refused to accept the change, claiming that Pluto was still the ninth planet because it has an ocean under its surface, organic compounds on its surface, and its own moons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can write that the NASA Administrator declared Pluto a planet once again. I'm sticking by that, it's the way I learnt it, and I'm committed to it,' Bridenstine said at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bridenstine led the space agency from 2018 to 2021 after being appointed to the position during President Trump's first term in office. He's criticized the IAU for having a 'sloppy definition' of what they consider a planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
      
    &lt;/p&gt;
       

  &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today cleared for marketing the first in vitro diagnostic device that tests blood to aid in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. The Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio is for the early detection of amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer’s disease in adult patients, aged 55 years and older, exhibiting signs and symptoms of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alzheimer’s disease impacts too many people, more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined,” &lt;strong&gt;said FDA Commissioner Martin A. Makary, M.D., M.P.H.&lt;/strong&gt; “Knowing that 10% of people aged 65 and older have Alzheimer's, and that by 2050 that number is expected to double, I am hopeful that new medical products such as this one will help patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease, a brain disorder known to slowly destroy memory and thinking skills, and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks, is progressive, meaning that the disease gets worse over time. In most people with Alzheimer’s disease, clinical symptoms first appear later in life. Amyloid plaques in a patient’s brain are a hallmark sign of Alzheimer’s disease. While amyloid plaques can occur in other diseases, being able to detect the presence of plaque, along with other evaluations, helps the doctor determine the probable cause of the patient’s symptoms and findings. These plaques can be detected and visualized using amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans, often years before clinical symptom onset, to aid in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. PET scans, however, are a costly and time-consuming option and expose patients to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio measures two proteins, pTau217 and β-amyloid 1-42, found in human plasma, a component of blood, and calculates the numerical ratio of the levels of the two proteins. This ratio is correlated to the presence or absence of amyloid plaques in the patient’s brain, reducing the need for a PET scan. Similar FDA-authorized/cleared tests, one from the same company as this new test, are used with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, which are collected through an invasive lumbar puncture, also called a spinal tap. This new Lumipulse test only requires a simple blood draw, making it less invasive and much easier for patients to access.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nearly 7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease and this number is projected to rise to nearly 13 million,” &lt;strong&gt;said Center for Devices and Radiological Health Director Michelle Tarver, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt; “Today’s clearance is an important step for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, making it easier and potentially more accessible for U.S. patients earlier in the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During review of the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio, the FDA evaluated data from a multi-center clinical study of 499 individual plasma samples from adults who were cognitively impaired. The samples were tested by the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio and compared with amyloid PET scan or CSF test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this clinical study, 91.7% of individuals with Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio positive results had the presence of amyloid plaques by PET scan or CSF test result, and 97.3 % of individuals with negative results had a negative amyloid PET scan or CSF test result. Less than 20% of the 499 patients tested received an indeterminate Lumipulse G pTau217/β-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that the new blood test can reliably predict the presence or absence of amyloid pathology associated with Alzheimer’s disease at the time of the test in patients who are cognitively impaired. The test is intended for patients presenting at a specialized care setting with signs and symptoms of cognitive decline. The results must be interpreted in conjunction with other patient clinical information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risks associated with the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio are mainly the possibility of false positive and false negative test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;False positive results, in conjunction with other clinical information, could lead to an inappropriate diagnosis of, and unnecessary treatment for, Alzheimer’s disease. This could lead to psychological distress, delay in receiving a correct diagnosis as well as expense and the risk for side effects from unnecessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;False negative results could result in additional unnecessary diagnostic tests and potential delay in effective treatment. Importantly, the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio is not intended as a screening or stand-alone diagnostic test and other clinical evaluations or additional tests should be used for determining treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA reviewed the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio through the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-approvals-and-clearances/510k-clearances"&gt;510(k) premarket notification pathway&lt;/a&gt;. A 510(k) notification is a premarket submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that a new device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. The FDA found that the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio is substantially equivalent to the Lumipulse G β-amyloid Ratio (1-42/1-40), which is the previously authorized test that uses CSF samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio was granted &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/how-study-and-market-your-device/breakthrough-devices-program"&gt;Breakthrough Device&lt;/a&gt; designation, a process designed to expedite the development and review of devices that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA issued clearance of the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio to Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
