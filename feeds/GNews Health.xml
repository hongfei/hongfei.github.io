&lt;p&gt;A YOUNG woman has chosen to end her life with medical aid after fighting a rare and terminal neurological disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Annaliese Holland, 25, has been in debilitating pain since she was a child, enduring repeated &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/hospital/"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; stays as doctors attempted to diagnose the disease which caused chronic pain, nausea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_15522116" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Her parents and sister were heartbroken by her decision&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: GoFundMe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_15522118" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Annaliese was diagnosed with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy when she turned 18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: Not known, clear with picture desk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The 25-year-old from Adelaide, South &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/australia/"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, has depended on an IV feeding tube for the past decade but has now decided to end her life with aid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Australia patients applying for assisted dying must be a permanent resident and have a condition expected to cause death within 12 months for neurodegenerative conditions, and 6 months for others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be approved patients must go through multiple safeguards, including assessments from two doctors to confirm legibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="outstream" class="nuk-ad-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once a person is deemed mentally competent they are given the option to either self-administer or have a doctor deliever the lethal substance.&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p class="article-readmore__content-clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		


&lt;p&gt;While assisted dying is currently illegal in the UK, a bill proposed last year  seeks to allow terminally ill adults to request and receive assistance to end their own lives under strict safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until Annaliese turned 18 and transitioned from a paediatric facility to an adult one was she then finally diagnosed with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The neurological disease is rare; it damages the nerve that controls the heart rate, blood pressure, digestion and urination.&lt;/p&gt;



		
						
						
		



&lt;p&gt;She said: “My bowel acts as if it’s blocked but there’s nothing actually blocking it. It’s just the nerves don’t work so, as gross as this is, my stools would back up so much that I would throw it up or drain out my tummy.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“I had feeding tubes placed in me and I was still vomiting and then we discovered that my stomach wasn’t emptying so I was put on TPN (IV feeding).”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aged 22, Annaliese was told her condition was terminal – which led her to decide to “die on her own terms.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She now has multi-organ failure and has survived &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/sepsis/"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt; 25 times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Australian was put on strong medications to help subside her symptoms but it caused her to develop serve osteoporosis – a condition causing bones to become weak and brittle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Annaliese previously fractured her spine in four places, cracked her sternum in half and nearly crushed her heart and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: “I was so miserable, you can’t change it so you have to just deal with it really. Even though there’s beautiful moments in my days, they are exhausting and long. I’m in chronic debilitating pain.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The young woman missed out on her 18th and 21st birthdays, spending them both bed-bound in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure id="attachment_15522128" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Annaliese said she felt stuck as she watched her friends get married and start their own families&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_15522138" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Australian battled sepsis 25 times and suffered many broken bones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Annaliese added: “All my friends, they’re having &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/babies/"&gt;babies&lt;/a&gt;, getting engaged, married. Everyone’s life is moving and I’m just stuck. I’m not living. I’m surviving every day, which is tough.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She now no longer wants to endure the pain and the disease which has left her feeling like she is, “walking on a field of landmines.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After seeing herself in the mirror one day while hospitalised, it solidified her decision to “die on her own terms” with medical aid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Annaliese said: “It wasn’t me and I was so exhausted,” she said. “Life for me now is getting up each day doing what I need to do medically, taking the painkillers, trying to get through the day, just to go to bed and do it all again.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her parents and sister are heartbroken at the idea with her mother, Amanda, always hoping for a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Amanda knows what challenges her daughter faces, her father Patrick has watched Annaliese overcome every setback and believed she could get past the illness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Every time she goes to the hospital, she fights for her own life. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The amount of times Annie has been in hospital and on her deathbed… to have to sit there and watch her go through it … but she is amazing,” said Patrick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Annaliese revealed she told her father in the kitchen one day: “Dad I’ve had enough.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The moment her father came to terms with her decision was when he watched as she was resuscitated by doctors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She remembered saying: “Dad, please let me go. I will not hate you if you let me go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If this happens again, I don’t want anything. And please know that in my heart, you letting me go and saying no to treatment…I’m happy with and that’s what I want.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She confessed to thinking it was weird to be happy: “It’s hard for me because I am in pain and then I am at peace, but then I put the pain onto my &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/family/"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You have this battle in your head of not wanting to hurt them, so I will put some thought into how it will happen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a relief for Annaliese; explaining that she won’t have to wake up everyday with anxiety about the pain-filled day ahead or feel the pain of starving to death when they can’t feed me anymore, or the horror of sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p class="article-readmore__content-clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		


&lt;p&gt;Following the three week evaluation process Annaliese was approved for Voluntary Assisted Dying (VAD).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added: “I feel so lucky that I do have this choice. It’s one of the bravest things you could ever do, to say I want VAD. It’s not giving up. You’ve had enough and you fought bloody hard.”&lt;/p&gt;

						EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide.					&lt;/p&gt;
				
				&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society – from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it’s rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/youre-not-alone/"&gt;The Sun launched the You’re Not Alone campaign.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s all vow to ask for help when we need it, and listen out for others… &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7194521/the-sun-suicide-prevention-campaign-launch/"&gt;You’re Not Alone.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have known that moving our bodies can sharpen our minds. Physical activity &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)00184-9"&gt;boosts blood flow to the brain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.05.034"&gt;enhances neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nri3041"&gt;reduces chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. These processes are believed &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03955-6"&gt;to protect against cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03955-6"&gt;including dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite decades of research, major questions have remained unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does exercising at any age help reduce your risk of dementia? Or only when you're young? And what if you have a higher genetic risk – can exercising still make a difference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-diabetes-drug-is-linked-to-exceptional-longevity-in-women"&gt;A Common Diabetes Drug Is Linked to 'Exceptional Longevity' in Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.44439"&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; from the long-running Framingham Heart Study in the United States, published today, offers some of the clearest answers to date. Their findings support what many clinicians already tell patients: exercise helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study also offers new insight into the potentially protective effect of staying active at the age of 45 and over – even for those with a certain genetic predisposition to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the study examine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research draws on data from 4,290 participants enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/framingham-heart-study-fhs"&gt;This study&lt;/a&gt; began in 1948, when researchers recruited more than 5,000 adults aged 30 and over from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts, to investigate long-term risk factors for cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1971, a second generation (more than 5,000 adult children of the original cohort, and their spouses) were enrolled, forming the &lt;a href="https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/framoffspring/"&gt;Offspring cohort&lt;/a&gt;. This generation then had regular health and medical assessments every four to eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182386" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182386" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/best_age_exercise_dementia_header--642x361.jpg" alt="Silhouettes of many people running at sunset" class="size-medium wp-image-182386" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/best_age_exercise_dementia_header--642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/best_age_exercise_dementia_header--768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/best_age_exercise_dementia_header--600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/best_age_exercise_dementia_header-.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182386" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The Framingham Heart Study included measures of physical activity over generations. &lt;span&gt;(K.C. Alfred/Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.44439"&gt;the new study&lt;/a&gt;, participants self-reported their physical activity. This included incidental activity such as climbing stairs as well as vigorous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants first reported these activities in 1971, and then again over several decades. Based on the age at which each participant was first evaluated, they were grouped into three categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;young adulthood (26–44 years): assessed in the late 1970s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;midlife (45–64 years): assessed during the late 1980s and 1990s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;older adulthood (65 years and over): assessed in the late 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine how physical activity influences dementia risk, the researchers looked at how many people developed dementia in each age group and at what age they were diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then they considered physical activity patterns within age groups (low, moderate, high) to see if there was any link between how much exercise people did and whether they developed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also looked at who had &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(20)30412-9"&gt;a known genetic risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="182379" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, the APOE ε4 allele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="Man doing freestyle in a pool." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/703327/original/file-20251119-56-2ggcoy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/703327/original/file-20251119-56-2ggcoy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703327/original/file-20251119-56-2ggcoy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703327/original/file-20251119-56-2ggcoy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703327/original/file-20251119-56-2ggcoy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703327/original/file-20251119-56-2ggcoy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703327/original/file-20251119-56-2ggcoy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Research has long shown moving our bodies can sharpen our minds.

Those with the highest levels of activity in midlife and later life were 41–45% less likely to develop dementia than those who had the lowest levels of activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the case even after adjusting for demographic factors that increase dementia risk (such as age and education) and other chronic health factors (such as high blood pressure and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="182379" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Interestingly, being physically active during early adulthood did not influence dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key innovation of this study was its examination of the genetic risk factor, the APOE ε4 allele. This analysis suggests something new:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in midlife, higher physical activity lowered dementia risk only in people who didn't carry this genetic predisposition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but in later life, higher physical activity lowered dementia risk in both carriers and non-carriers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means for people genetically predisposed to dementia, staying active later in life may still offer meaningful protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How significant are these results?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings largely reinforce what scientists already know: exercise is good for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sets this study apart is its large sample, multi-decade follow-up, and its genetic analysis across different life periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suggestion that midlife activity benefits some individuals differently depending on their genetic risk, while late-life activity benefits nearly everyone, may also add a new layer to public health messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-much-weekly-exercise-can-slash-your-dementia-risk-by-41-percent"&gt;This Much Weekly Exercise Can Slash Your Dementia Risk by 41 Percent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;But there were some limitations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity was largely self-reported in this study, so there is a possibility of recall bias. We also do not know what type of exercise brings the best benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia cases in the youngest age group were rather rare too, so the small sample limits how definitively we can make conclusions about early adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cohort is also predominantly of European ancestry and share environmental factors as they come from the same town, so this limits how much we can generalise the findings to more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is particularly important given &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2021.100179"&gt;global inequities in dementia risk and diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;. Knowledge about dementia and risk factors also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ajag.70071"&gt;remains low&lt;/a&gt; in ethnically diverse groups, where it is often still seen as a "normal" part of ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does this mean for us?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is refreshingly simple though: move more, at any age. At this stage we know there are more benefits than harm.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270074/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yogurt is linked to an impressive list of health benefits, especially better gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RDs say when you eat yogurt isn’t nearly as important for gut health as how often you eat it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look for the “Live &amp;amp; Active Cultures” seal and pair it with prebiotic-rich berries or oats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Every spoonful of yogurt delivers more than just a boost of protein and calcium. It’s packed with millions of gut-friendly bacteria that can help maintain a healthy body weight, lower your risk of type 2 diabetes and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/snacks-gastroenterologists-swear-by-for-gut-health-11844925" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support digestion and gut health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yet, unlike probiotic supplements that provide instructions for the proper timing and dosage, your container of yogurt doesn’t come with a user’s manual. So, we asked dietitians if there is a best time to eat yogurt for gut health, and what else you can do to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/eat-these-foods-for-a-healthier-gut-this-summer-11771736" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maximize its digestive benefits&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s what they told us.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-is-there-a-best-time"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Is There a Best Time? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The short answer is no. “Yogurt is a flexible and nourishing food you can enjoy any time of day,” says &lt;a href="http://wisebitenutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Raksha Shah, M.A., RDN.&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Its gut-health benefits are driven by its &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037462/benefits-of-taking-probiotics/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;multiple strains of probiotics&lt;/a&gt;. “These live cultures help support gut health by competing with less-beneficial microbes and by contributing to a balanced microbial environment,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.villagemotherhood.co/val-warner" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Val Warner, M.S., RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;. But for yogurt’s probiotics to do their job, they have to be able to withstand the harsh acidic conditions of your stomach. Fortunately, the milk in yogurt helps shield those delicate probiotics from that acid storm.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, whether you prefer &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/255766/ricotta-yogurt-parfait/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;yogurt for breakfast&lt;/a&gt;, as an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/260856/greek-yogurt-with-fruit-nuts/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;afternoon snack&lt;/a&gt; or for dessert after dinner, its probiotics are protected by its matrix of nutrients. That makes the timing less critical for supporting your gut than the other factors you’re about to learn about.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Live and Active Cultures &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Yogurts with live and active cultures deliver probiotics that can support a healthier microbiome and beneficial shifts in gut bacteria,” says &lt;a href="https://eatswimwin.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Katie Schimmelpfenning, RD&lt;/a&gt;. Yogurt gets its probiotics—and its characteristic tangy flavor—from the fermentation process. It is made by adding a lactic acid bacteria starter culture to milk. It is then fermented to create the creamy dairy product you know and love. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yogurt’s starter culture typically includes bacteria, such as &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Lactococcus &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Leuconostoc. &lt;/em&gt;Many manufacturers also add &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-choose-the-best-probiotic-supplement-11712021" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;extra probiotic strains&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; and additional &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt;, after fermentation to boost the beneficial bacteria count.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, the amount and type of live bacteria can vary substantially from brand to brand. To make sure your favorite yogurt is giving you a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-probiotic-food-at-trader-joes-8605122" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy dose of probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, look for the “Live &amp;amp; Active Cultures” seal on the label. This voluntary certification by the International Dairy Foods Association confirms it contained at least 100 million cultures per gram at the time it was manufactured.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Its Specific Bacterial Strains &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The “Live &amp;amp; Active Cultures” seal is a good start. However, for the best digestive health benefits, you’ll want to make sure your yogurt contains strains that have actually been shown to improve gut health. That’s because probiotics are strain-specific, meaning their effects can vary dramatically from one strain to another.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Some [types of yogurt] are made with standard starter cultures, while others are boosted with specific strains that have proven benefits for supporting gut balance and easing digestive symptoms,” says Shah. For instance, &lt;em&gt;L. acidophilus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; species are linked to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290640/lactose-intolerance-symptoms-causes-what-to-eat-and-more/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improved lactose digestion&lt;/a&gt;, which explains why some people with lactose intolerance can handle yogurt better than dairy milk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Alternatively,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;certain strains of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium, &lt;/em&gt;such as &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium lactis &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium longum,&lt;/em&gt; have been shown to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/home-remedies-help-you-poop-11823328" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;help alleviate constipation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; How Often You Eat It &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re not eating yogurt frequently, it might not be as helpful as you think. “Gut-health benefits from yogurt don’t come from a one-off serving alone, but from regular consumption as part of a balanced diet that supports a healthy microbiome,” says &lt;a href="http://www.mynutritionandme.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Karolin Saweres, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While research has found that some favorable strains of bacteria, including &lt;em&gt;S. thermophilus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;B. lactis&lt;/em&gt;, are present in the gut after eating yogurt, they don’t stick around for long. Just like food, they move through your gut and, eventually, you poop them out. During their brief stay, they can do good things for your gut. But those probiotic benefits won’t last unless you eat yogurt every day or so to replace them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; What You Eat with Your Yogurt &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A daily yogurt habit gets you just part of the way to a healthier gut, explains Warner. While yogurt provides &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/288067/3-surprising-reasons-your-gut-health-matters/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;friendly microbes&lt;/a&gt;, adding other gut-healthy foods can help feed and nourish those microbes, she says. For instance, berries, nuts, tomatoes, bananas and onions contain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8052689/best-prebiotic-foods-for-better-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;gut-supporting prebiotic fibers&lt;/a&gt;. When you eat these foods, their prebiotic fibers travel undigested to the colon. When they get there, they are fermented by your existing good gut bacteria (and any probiotics that happen to be hanging around from yogurt you recently ate). This produces helpful compounds, called short-chain fatty acids, which help nourish your gut lining to keep it healthy and functioning well.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Now that you know about all the great things yogurt can do for your gut health, these dietitian-approved tips can help you get the most out of it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for specific strains of bacteria&lt;/strong&gt;: “Check the label for ‘live and active cultures’ and, if you can, pick yogurts that list specific strains like &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;acidophilus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;lactis&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus casei&lt;/em&gt;,” says Shah. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose varieties with minimal added sugar&lt;/strong&gt;: Yogurt can be a healthy way to satisfy a sweet tooth, but it can also be loaded with added sugars. Plain, unsweetened yogurt with a little fruit is ideal. But if you need something sweeter, Shah recommends looking for brands with no more than 5 to 10 grams of added sugar per serving. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add prebiotics&lt;/strong&gt;: “Some yogurts now include prebiotic fibers like inulin or FOS, which feed those good bacteria and help them thrive,” says Shah. Or, add your own prebiotics by topping your yogurt with sliced bananas, a handful of berries, or a few tablespoons of oats, flaxseed or wheat germ. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opt for strained (Greek-style) yogurt:&lt;/strong&gt; Since strained (Greek-style) yogurt is made by straining out its whey protein, it’s concentrated, often providing more probiotics per serving than traditional yogurt.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, you’ll get a bigger protein boost, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yogurt has more than earned its reputation as a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7909480/best-foods-for-digestion/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;top food for digestive health&lt;/a&gt;. But does when you eat your yogurt make a difference for your gut health? You’ll be happy to learn that the answer is no!  Since the milk in yogurt protects its probiotics from your digestive system’s harsh acidic environment, you can enjoy the flavor and gut-health benefits of yogurt whenever it fits your schedule. What matters more than the timing is choosing a yogurt that contains live and active cultures, limiting added sugars and eating it regularly. However, if you’d like even more gut-healthy benefits, enjoy your yogurt with some prebiotic-rich berries, bananas, oats, flaxseed or wheat germ to give those beneficial bacteria the fuel they need to thrive.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Those who have never endured the relentless ringing of tinnitus can only dream of the torment. In fact, a bad dream may be the closest some get to experiencing anything like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subjective sound, which can also be a hissing, buzzing, or clicking, is heard by no one else, and it may be present constantly, or may come and go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists at the University of Oxford now &lt;a href="https://rnid.org.uk/hearing-research/silencing-tinnitus/how-does-sleep-affect-tinnitus/"&gt;suspect&lt;/a&gt; that sleep and tinnitus are closely intertwined in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings hint at a fundamental relationship between the two conditions – one that has, surprisingly, &lt;a href="https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/news/a-role-of-sleep-in-tinnitus-identified-for-the-first-time"&gt;been overlooked&lt;/a&gt; in the brain until very recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-ear-wax-might-hold-clues-to-early-parkinsons-study-finds?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Ear Wax Might Hold Clues to Early Parkinson's, Study Finds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What first made me and my colleagues curious were the remarkable parallels between tinnitus and sleep," neuroscientist Linus Milinski at Oxford's Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute told ScienceAlert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tinnitus is a debilitating medical condition, whereas sleep is a natural state we enter regularly, yet both appear to rely on spontaneous brain activity. Because there is still no effective treatment for subjective tinnitus, I believe that exploring these similarities might offer new ways to understand and eventually treat phantom percepts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 'phantom percept' is when our brains fool us into thinking we are seeing, hearing, feeling, or smelling something that is not there, physically speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people only experience phantom percepts during sleep, but for around 15 percent of the world's population, an inescapable noise rings in their ears during waking hours, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus is the world's most common phantom percept, and yet there is no known cause or cure, despite a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK217855/"&gt;long list of hypotheses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many individuals with tinnitus &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1735455"&gt;report poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000040303"&gt;show poor sleep patterns&lt;/a&gt;, the potential connection to this crucial bodily function has only recently come to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Milinski led a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcac089"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, which the authors claim is the first to consider, at a functional level, how sleep might impact tinnitus, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oxford researchers proposed that the large spontaneous waves of brain activity that occur during &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-stage-of-sleep-seems-critical-for-reducing-risk-of-dementia"&gt;deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;, or non-&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-one-step-closer-to-finding-trigger-in-brain-for-rem-sleep"&gt;rapid eye movement sleep&lt;/a&gt; (non-REM), might suppress the brain activity that leads to tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test that idea, the team turned to ferrets, which have a similar auditory system to humans. In &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0304306"&gt;experiments&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2024, researchers found that the ferrets that developed stronger tinnitus also showed disrupted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We could actually see these sleep problems appear at the same time as tinnitus after noise exposure," Milinski told ScienceAlert. "This suggested, for the first time, a clear link between developing tinnitus and disrupted sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the ferrets that developed tinnitus showed overly responsive brain activity to sound. When the ferrets finally did manage to slip into non-REM sleep, that hyperactivity was dampened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that sleep may temporarily mask the effects of tinnitus by engaging the same brain circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings indicate that deep sleep may indeed help mitigate tinnitus and could reveal natural brain mechanisms for modulating abnormal activity," said Milinski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on non-human animals has its obvious limitations, but the same sort of brain activity patterns may exist in humans, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since their 2022 review, Milinski says the field has rapidly expanded, with a growing number of large-scale studies investigating how sleep, the environment, and tinnitus interact – and not just in ferrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182105" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182105" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/fcac089ga1-642x263.jpeg" alt="Graphical abstract of the study's findings on tinnitus and sleep" class="size-medium wp-image-182105" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/fcac089ga1-642x263.jpeg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/fcac089ga1-1200x492.jpeg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/fcac089ga1-768x315.jpeg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/fcac089ga1-1536x630.jpeg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/fcac089ga1-2048x840.jpeg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/fcac089ga1-600x246.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182105" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A graphic depicting the study's findings.

It may be a kind of vicious circle, although I do not believe it is unbreakable," speculates Milinski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we do not sleep well, we become more vulnerable to stress, and stress is one of the strongest factors known to worsen tinnitus. Stress can even trigger tinnitus to begin with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research could not only lead to effective tinnitus treatments, it may help scientists better understand the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-rare-state-of-sleep-could-reveal-secrets-of-consciousness"&gt;mysteries of sleep&lt;/a&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2022 review was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcac089"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Lately, as the government’s once-impressive eradication programmes have faltered, there has been an increase in mosquito and sandfly related viruses such as chikungunya, dengue, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/02/outbreak-of-oropouche-virus-in-brazil-should-be-a-wake-up-call-say-experts" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;oropouche&lt;/a&gt; and zika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the past months, Cuba has suffered a particularly terrible epidemic of chikungunya, which, while rarely fatal, causes a week-long fever and terrible joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Alerts were first raised in Matanzas in Cuba’s heartlands last July. By late October, health officials said there had been 13,000 new fever cases across the country in a week.

Their house, very close to the Cauto River, was inundated and barely standing. Pérez swiftly contracted chikungunya. She has struggled to get up, applies alcohol compresses to lower the fever and relies on the paracetamol her sister gives her. Many families without access to repellants and medicines have been forced to rely on natural remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cauto del Paso dam, the largest in the province, started to spill over the day after the hurricane arrived, releasing &lt;a href="https://en.cibercuba.com/noticias/2025-11-03-u1-e197721-s27061-nid314171-alivio-granma-presa-cauto-paso-reduce-caudal-tras" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;4,000 cubic metres a second&lt;/a&gt; at the peak of the flood, according to state officials.

			&lt;p&gt;A major new  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="182467" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; involving more than 1,600 people has found that a GLP-1 pill form of the drug orforglipron works about as well as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/volunteers-lose-up-to-25-body-weight-in-high-dose-wegovy-trials"&gt;injectable semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; for people with type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="182467" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following an experiment conducted over 72 weeks and across 136 sites in 10 countries, a team led by obesity-medicine specialist Deborah Horn of the University of Texas reported that participants lost an average of 9.6 percent of their body weight on the highest dose of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's comparable to the roughly 10 to 15 percent loss in body mass commonly seen in people with diabetes taking injectable semaglutide over a similar period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-weight-loss-strategy-is-5x-more-effective-than-ozempic-trials-find"&gt;&lt;b&gt;One Weight Loss Strategy Is 5x More Effective Than Ozempic, Trials Find&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736%2825%2902165-8"&gt;the researchers write in their paper&lt;/a&gt;, "the findings indicate that orforglipron could address the unmet need for oral therapy by achieving outcomes similar to those of injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists, potentially shifting treatment paradigms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs exploit the body's natural mechanisms for reducing appetite after a meal. When you eat, your gut releases a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/a&gt;), which activates receptors in various organs. When these receptors are triggered, a few things happen: your &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2012.11.008"&gt;appetite decreases&lt;/a&gt;, your pancreas &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.6065/apem.2017.22.1.15"&gt;increases insulin&lt;/a&gt; and reduces glucagon release, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/XCE.0000000000000321"&gt;digestion slows&lt;/a&gt; so blood sugar rises more gradually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs are synthetic mimics of that hormone, triggering the same pathways in ways that can help people with diabetes regulate their blood sugar, and, more recently, assist people in losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the drug can only be administered by injection. Its peptides &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.08.032"&gt;break down too quickly&lt;/a&gt; in stomach acid, ruling out oral doses of the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orforglipron, by contrast, is not a peptide, but still activates the same receptor as GLP-1. It's also absorbed in the digestive tract like a more conventional drug. So far, signs of its efficacy are promising: a &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2511774"&gt;previous clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; involving 3,127 people with obesity, but without diabetes, showed an average 12.4 percent loss in body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new study was designed to observe how the drug behaves in people with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/time-restricted-eating-helps-control-blood-sugar-in-type-2-diabetes"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. The 1,613 participants had all been diagnosed with the condition and were classified as either overweight or obese. The average age of the participants was 57, and the average weight was 101 kilograms (223 pounds).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were sorted into four groups. One group was given a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="182467" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/incredible-placebo-study-shows-fake-pills-can-reduce-stress"&gt;no active drug ingredients&lt;/a&gt; to serve as a control. The other three groups were given orforglipron at a dosage of either 6, 12, or 36 milligrams. For 72 weeks, each participant took a daily dose of their assigned pill while maintaining a diet in which 500 calories had been cut from their baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither the researchers nor the participants knew which pill each participant was taking, a technique known as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-clinical-trial-shows-micro-doses-of-lsd-can-increase-a-person-s-pain-tolerance"&gt;double-blinding&lt;/a&gt; that reduces bias when interpreting the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those results were pretty conclusive. The group on the highest dose, 36 milligrams, lost, on average, 9.6 percent of their body weight, or around 9.6 kilograms. The 12-milligram group lost an average of 7 percent of their body weight, and the 6-milligram group 5.1 percent. The placebo group, on average, lost 2.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An astonishing 26 percent of the group on the highest dose lost more than 15 percent of their body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other health indicators had improved. Blood sugar markers showed a significant improvement for all doses of orforglipron compared to the placebo, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-links-99-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-with-four-risk-factors"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/anti-inflammatory-diets-are-all-over-tiktok-heres-what-the-science-says"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-pressure-guidelines-mean-you-may-now-have-hypertension"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; markers also improved. Side effects were similar to the side effects of injectable GLP-1 drugs; nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation – all unsurprising, given the way the drug works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not quite as effective as a once-weekly 15-milligram injection of GLP-1 drug tirzepatide, which demonstrated an average of 14.7 percent of body weight lost in diabetic participants in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(23)01200-X"&gt;an earlier clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;, but the ease, comfort, and accessibility of a pill may make the slightly lower effectiveness a worthwhile trade-off for some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know it is harder for individuals with diabetes to lose weight. It is exciting to have an oral medication that provides double-digit weight loss, which on average was 23 pounds," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1106740"&gt;Horn says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once FDA approved, orforglipron is scheduled to be available in 2026 at a significantly decreased cost compared to current injectables. This could position it to be the 'metformin' of obesity and become widely covered by insurance plans, opening the door to treatment for all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)02165-8"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lancet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In reality, the condition usually develops slowly, with subtle symptoms that are easy to overlook. Early signs may include persistent fatigue, unexplained weight gain, fluid retention, coughing when lying down, shortness of breath, or sleep disturbances. Dr Dmitry Yaranov, a cardiologist and heart transplant surgeon, emphasises that recognising these warning signs early is essential. By identifying the subtle indicators of a struggling heart, individuals can seek medical care promptly, manage the condition effectively, and reduce the risk of serious complications. Awareness and timely intervention can significantly improve long-term heart health and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding heart failure and how it develops&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood effectively to meet the body’s needs. This inefficiency can lead to fluid buildup in the lungs, abdomen, and other tissues, causing a range of symptoms that may not initially seem heart-related. Unlike acute heart attacks, heart failure often progresses quietly, and early signs can be mistaken for fatigue, stress, or ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Heart Failure Warning: 4 Symptoms You Might Be Overlooking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Yaranov highlights that recognising these early, subtle symptoms allows patients to receive care before the condition worsens, improving outcomes and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heart failure: Early warning signs that are overlooked&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sudden weight gain: An early warning sign of heart failure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most overlooked signs of heart failure is sudden weight gain. This usually occurs over a few days and results from fluid retention. When the heart struggles to pump efficiently, fluid accumulates in the body, causing swelling and rapid weight increase. Dr Yaranov explains, “Your scale can detect these changes before your body feels them. A sudden gain, especially accompanied by swelling in the legs or abdomen, can be one of the first signals that your heart is under stress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising this early can prompt timely evaluation and treatment, potentially preventing further fluid buildup and complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic cough and wheezing related to heart health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A persistent cough or wheezing, particularly when lying down, can be a subtle but significant sign of heart failure. This differs from a cough caused by a common cold because it is linked to fluid accumulation in the lungs. When lying flat, fluid can shift and irritate the airways, triggering coughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Yaranov advises, “If your cough worsens when you lie down or feels unusual compared to typical colds, it may indicate your heart is struggling to maintain circulation. This warrants further medical assessment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digestive symptoms: Nausea and loss of appetite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart failure can also affect the digestive system. Reduced blood flow to the gut may slow digestion and lead to symptoms such as nausea, loss of appetite, or feeling full after small meals. These signs are often subtle but can indicate that the heart is not supplying enough oxygen-rich blood to the digestive organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Yaranov, “When the heart slows, the gut responds. Feeling nauseous or unusually full can be an early, quiet signal that something is wrong with your heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive changes: Confusion and memory loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is highly sensitive to changes in blood flow, and reduced circulation from heart inefficiency can cause cognitive issues. Patients may experience memory lapses, confusion, difficulty concentrating, or a sense of mental fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Yaranov notes, “Your brain may notice reduced blood supply before you feel physically unwell. Trouble focusing or forgetting simple tasks can be subtle early warnings that the heart is not pumping efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep problems as a heart warning sign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disturbances are another symptom that can indicate early heart failure. Difficulty falling asleep, frequent waking during the night, or needing extra pillows to breathe comfortably can be linked to fluid buildup in the lungs and reduced cardiac efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Yaranov explains, “Restless nights are often dismissed as insomnia or stress. However, when the heart is struggling, these sleep issues can be a signal that your body needs help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preventing heart failure: Tips to act on early warning signs&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While recognising early symptoms is crucial, taking proactive measures can help reduce the risk of heart failure or slow its progression. Lifestyle modifications, regular monitoring, and timely medical interventions play a key role in protecting heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a heart-healthy diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A balanced diet low in salt, saturated fats, and added sugars helps prevent fluid retention and high blood pressure, both of which can strain the heart. Focus on whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Monitoring portion sizes and reducing processed foods can support weight control and improve cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor weight and fluid changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly tracking your weight can help identify sudden fluid retention early. Even a small, unexplained increase in a few days should prompt attention. Keeping an eye on swelling in the ankles, legs, or abdomen can also help detect early signs of heart stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate, consistent exercise strengthens the heart, improves circulation, and supports overall cardiovascular health. Activities such as walking, swimming, or cycling are effective, but individuals should consult a doctor before starting any new exercise routine, especially if early symptoms are present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good sleep supports heart health by regulating blood pressure and reducing stress on the cardiovascular system. Establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a comfortable sleeping environment, and addressing sleep disturbances early can help prevent worsening heart strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress and monitor symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress can increase heart rate and blood pressure, worsening heart function over time. Techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help. Additionally, keeping a record of unusual symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, or cognitive changes can provide valuable information for your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early evaluation by a cardiologist is essential if multiple warning signs appear. Routine check-ups, blood pressure monitoring, and heart function tests can detect problems before they become serious, allowing for timely treatment and better long-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;When to seek medical advice&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a single symptom does not automatically mean heart failure, a combination of sudden weight gain, coughing when lying down, digestive disturbances, memory issues, and sleep problems should prompt medical evaluation. Early detection allows doctors to manage the condition effectively and prevent serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By paying attention to these subtle signs, individuals can take proactive steps to protect their heart health, seek timely medical care, and improve long-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/why-your-ankles-swell-experts-reveal-10-hidden-causes-including-early-signs-of-heart-failure/articleshow/125453400.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Why your ankles swell: Experts reveal 10 hidden causes, including early signs of heart failure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 08:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAJBVV95cUxONl9CekJvMjJGV0JST1RfQlZBOEwyWmhpODhCS3JlakJkTS01dHdPQTZqb2plV2hYb1RpaHQwUmRFaHBGbFhUeHk3OUc4MVJyUWNBUmlaT05VZFFBcVgyMFZxamJ0VHB2aWJuNlFkN3hOUUlQbHlpQl9uWE9jdll4WnBXTl9FMEhPdFJYOHpLclpEbUhBM0xrQTIwS1dvLU11ZjhpN2RKNU45RTEtazJiWUV1YktIZnE0cWt5WnAzUzc3aGdsZVJ0NGVxS3J5VFRZODVLN21hVEttVExFeDd6NnNUQzhHUlY3ZTNqVEZFSVFKZVV5bG1XWlhpcVpGanhQUGQ3aHdNaTNMdFlxaGROUnN0ZnExTm5BS2VablVOUzgxcnQ0UFlMS1BKN25BODJMWXZIWVgxLUxhTl9q</guid></item><item><title>减肥： Ozempic是否有天然替代品？ -今日医学新闻</title><link>https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/berberine-cinnamon-green-tea-may-mimic-ozempics-weight-loss-effect</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-7j3c6j"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/cinnamon-sticks-pile-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/cinnamon-sticks-pile-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/cinnamon-sticks-pile-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="eager" src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/cinnamon-sticks-pile-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg" alt="cinnamon sticks" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fberberine-cinnamon-green-tea-may-mimic-ozempics-weight-loss-effect&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fcinnamon-sticks-pile-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Weight%20loss%3A%20Are%20there%20any%20natural%20alternatives%20to%20Ozempic%3F" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/cinnamon-sticks-pile-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-y9j4no css-whkgel"&gt;Can some natural ingredients, such as cinnamon, boost weight loss and metabolism like Ozempic?

However, they have also offered new insights into the power of our own gut hormones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights include the understanding that signals from the gut to the brain suppress the appetite and help to control &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317536" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has led researchers to dive further into drug-free alternatives that may trigger the same things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Heliopolis University in Cairo, Egypt, recently published a review of the existing evidence in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750025000137?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Toxicology Reports&lt;/a&gt;, assessing how the natural hormone that is produced in the gut, called &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/glp-1-receptor-agonists-type-2-diabetes" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)&lt;/a&gt; might be affected by natural compounds from diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the same hormone targeted by GLP-1 drugs. At this time, experts have identified no natural compounds found that can exactly replicate the effects of GLP-1 injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, early research suggests that certain foods and the timing of meals may be useful in regulating GLP-1 hormone activity in the body, and thus potentially “rewiring” hunger and satiety cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers who conducted this review noted that one of the reasons they are searching for natural alternatives to the GLP-1 injections is because of cost and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people who may benefit from these injections may not be able to afford them. Natural alternatives may prove to be more accessible and less expensive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason this research is important is because of the potential adverse effects of the GLP-1 injections. While these injections are generally well tolerated, there are certain gastrointestinal &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/drugs-ozempic-side-effects" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; that may occur, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These side effects may cause some people to not take the medications as prescribed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people may also believe that natural remedies are better suited to a more holistic view of their health. This may mean they would be more likely to choose them over conventional medicines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also note that searching for natural alternatives to GLP-1 injections is not about giving up on medications that have been successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s about increasing treatment options and personalizing it to each patient’s preferences and needs,” the researchers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review notes that the natural compounds preliminary research is focusing on as potentially mimicking the effects of GLP-1 drugs include cinnamon, wheat, ginger, fermented green tea, and berberine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these compounds could modulate GLP-1 secretion and expression, research cited in the review has suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center noted that there are caveats to natural alternatives to GLP-1 injections. He told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Natural ingredients may help boost metabolism. However, it is a mild effect. These [compounds] should not be considered an alternative to the GLP-1 medications like Ozempic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali advised people to keep in mind that the naturally occurring ingredients may help with weight management to a mild degree, but only if combined with proper nutrition and exercise. There is no substitute for a healthy diet and lifestyle whether someone is using natural ingredients or taking the GLP-1 medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to him, these natural ingredients work in different ways, “either by stimulating the central nervous system to boost metabolism (caffeine), promote fat burning (green tea extract, capsaicin), or activating other enzymes (berberine).” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 06:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQTndQUGFod3NoQjliNTFFMVhpSGtKTmhROFUtQm8zR3Rfb2txWVRHZU9McktHQWNhTTZUY0swSk1TOWRVQ25MNnpoelZzS1VnZVNGS2dnZUF3c0J5Y2U3aXR0VTAzdk5zVDVoVHExdkFZQ0FSOW41bzBKWHBTZHZHNFpTNTI1SGxDMWJsM1JKWTdVdHhJSi1wY0ZfZFVOaDRmMU54VE8wY28xWjFN</guid></item><item><title>顶级神经科学家揭示了一种对大脑健康最好的补充剂，它也能改善睡眠-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/top-neuroscientist-reveals-the-one-best-supplement-for-brain-health-that-also-improves-sleep/articleshow/125453704.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors, wellness experts, and neuroscientists all emphasise on one thing: good sleep = healthy brain = healthy life. The brain is the command center of our body, controlling all our actions. Imagine it as the CPU of our body; now, imagine what would happen if it suddenly started to lag? All our actions, reflexes and control depend on it. For brain health and its optimal function, some naturally occurring supplements are required, one of which is magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientist Robert Love recently identified magnesium as his top supplement for supporting both optimal brain health and sleep, aligning with the rapidly growing trend on social media for magnesium and within the wellness community. As Love and other thought leaders point out, magnesium is a key player in hundreds of biochemical reactions that drive cognition, memory, focus, and recovery-one of the primary foundational nutrients anyone looking to support brain longevity and restful sleep should be getting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Daily habits to follow every night for a sharper brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The question is: Why magnesium?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium plays an important role in brain activity, being involved in more than 300 enzymatic reactions in the body. According to neuroscientist Robert Love, optimum levels of magnesium are associated with enhanced neural transmission, better memory retention, and improved cognitive ability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newer research, according to Robert Love, has started to link low levels of magnesium with a higher risk of neurodegenerative problems and chronic brain fog-symptoms that too many people ignore until it's a long-term problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the brain, magnesium enables healthy electrical activity that supports memory, learning, and neuroplasticity-the brain's inherent ability to adapt and change. According to Love, maintaining adequate magnesium supports not only day-to-day focus but, long-term, provides a protective buffer against cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Magnesium and sleep: Is there a link&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium doesn't just serve the waking brain; it's also strongly associated with the quality and depth of sleep. On Instagram, Love and other neuroscientists emphasize how this mineral balances the nervous system, lowering the stress hormones in the evening and smoothly easing one into those slower brainwave states needed for deep, restorative rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wellness experts and neuroscientists suggest that supplementing with the right form of magnesium will often translate to less interruption during the night, improved sleep efficiency, and even reduced symptoms of insomnia. This positive ripple effect carries over into the next day, as users report steadier energy, sharper recall, and better emotional balance--each a downstream benefit of high-quality sleep supported by proper magnesium intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which type of magnesium is the best?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not all types of magnesium are created equal when it comes to promoting brain function and sleep. Magnesium threonate stands out-it is the only form able to cross the blood-brain barrier, elevating levels directly in the brain. In clinical studies, it has been suggested that magnesium threonate improves memory and facilitates learning beyond its beneficial sleep effects. Magnesium glycinate is another broadly recommended type for sleep, having an added calming effect on the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dosage, safety and practical tips&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Love and other experts remind the audience that, with a few exceptions, magnesium is generally safe, but yielding the best results often requires consistent, measured use. Typical dosages associated with sleep and supporting the brain range between 150 to 400 mg daily, depending on individual need, dietary intake, and medical history.

He points out, “Your scale often knows before you do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chronic cough or wheezing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The cardiac surgeon warns that a chronic cough linked to heart failure can feel different from the usual coughs of a common cold. He explains, “A cough that worsens when lying down isn’t always lungs, sometimes it’s the heart struggling to keep up. If it feels ‘different’ than a cold, pay attention.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nausea or loss of appetite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gut related issues like nausea and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/aiims-gastroenterologist-lists-8-signs-your-body-is-telling-you-about-nutrient-deficiencies-tiredness-loss-of-appetite-101757401498085.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="loss of appetite"&gt;loss of appetite&lt;/a&gt; can also be linked to heart failure. Dr Yaranov explains, “When the heart slows down, the gut often does too. Feeling full quickly or unexplained nausea can be your body’s quiet signal that something’s off.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Confusion or memory loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The cardiologist emphasises that your brain detects reduced blood flow before you notice it, potentially causing cognitive issues such as memory loss and confusion. He explains, “Brain fog, trouble focusing, or forgetting simple things can happen when your heart isn’t pumping efficiently.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Difficulty sleeping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sleep problems can also act as early warning signs of heart failure. According to Dr Yaranov, “Restless nights, waking suddenly, or needing extra pillows can be more than ‘bad sleep’. It may be your heart asking for help.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods are displacing traditional foods and meals globally, degrading diet quality, and contributing to the rise of diet-related chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And despite the combined advertising spend of the leading ultra-processed food companies dwarfing even the total budget of the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="182359" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, there is plenty that governments, communities and health professionals can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the findings, published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, of our &lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/series-do/ultra-processed-food%2522%2522"&gt;three landmark papers&lt;/a&gt; on ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-vs-minimally-processed-food-simple-tips-to-make-better-choices"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra vs. Minimally Processed Food: Simple Tips to Make Better Choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are products engineered from industrial ingredients and cosmetic additives, typically containing few or no intact ingredients. Examples include soft drinks, chips, and many breakfast cereals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182372" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182372" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/sugar_breakfast_cereal_642.jpg" alt="bowl of breakfast cereal" class="wp-image-182372 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/sugar_breakfast_cereal_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/sugar_breakfast_cereal_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182372" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Breakfast cereals are often highly processed from industrial ingredients and cosmetic additives. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAG0VXHH-64/"&gt;Petra Malaeru's Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem, we argue, is not a lack of willpower on the part of individuals but rather is primarily commercially driven – the result of a powerful industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The evidence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01565-X/fulltext"&gt;first paper&lt;/a&gt; summarises the evidence, showing that ultra-processed foods are spreading globally. The share of ultra-processed foods in diets has climbed over decades in countries across the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, it's been consistently high for decades (around 50% of daily energy). Ultra-processed foods are essentially the national diet. The same goes for Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, this paper shows diets high in ultra-processed foods induce overeating and are nutritionally poor: more sugars, saturated fat and energy density, less fibre and key  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="182359" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and minerals, and fewer whole foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, this paper summarises the health risks. A &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01565-X/fulltext"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; we carried out, which included 104 long-term studies, found 92 reported greater associated risks of one or more chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta-analyses of these studies confirmed associations for obesity, type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="182359" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, Crohn's disease,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="182359" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and early death from all causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, it's not just about "too much sugar, salt and fat". &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(19)30248-7"&gt;Clinical &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.15922"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; show that when adults eat diets heavy in ultra-processed foods, they consume about 500–800 extra calories per day, gain weight and fat mass, and eat more rapidly, when compared with eating a non-ultra-processed diet with the same proportions of macronutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is likely because of higher energy density, tastiness, and soft textures that make overeating ultra-processed foods easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is clearly needed. However, the evidence is now strong enough to justify a global public health response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Policy options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our second &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01566-1/fulltext%2522%2522"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; outlines policy options for governments that wish to address the problem. Four stand out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Changing the products: reformulation – when sugar is swapped for sweeteners or fat is swapped for additives that provide a fat-like texture – does not solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, governments could set limits on selected additives and use "ultra-processed food markers" such as colours, flavours and non-sugar sweeteners (as well as high levels of sugar, fat and salt) to identify ultra-processed products for regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Fixing food environments: evidence-based policy options include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adopting mandatory front-of-pack warning labels, which &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01566-1/fulltext"&gt;work well&lt;/a&gt; to inform consumers and reduce purchasing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01566-1/fulltext"&gt;protecting children under 18&lt;/a&gt; – especially on digital platforms – from ultra-processed food marketing and extend protections beyond "kids' hours"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01566-1/fulltext"&gt;taxing sugary drinks&lt;/a&gt; (by at least 20%) and selected ultra-processed foods; use revenue to subsidise fruits, vegetables and freshly prepared meals for lower-income households&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01566-1/fulltext"&gt;removing ultra-processed foods from schools&lt;/a&gt;, hospitals and other public institutions, limiting the share of ultra-processed foods on supermarket shelves, and curbing availability of ultra-processed foods near schools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Curbing corporate power: governments could do more to regulate companies' portfolios and monitor and constrain the proportion of sales from ultra-processed foods; strengthen competition policy and consider tax reforms that curb excessive market power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Addressing subsidies and supply chains: governments could redirect agricultural subsidies away from monoculture commodity ingredients for ultra-processed foods (such as corn, soy and sugar), and align environmental policies (on issues such as plastics reduction or water use) with nutrition goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success will come from tailored, coordinated packages – there's no silver bullet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Countering the ultra-processed food industry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our third &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01567-3/fulltext"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; asks why ultra-processed foods are taking over human diets and how to mobilise a global public health response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer: address corporate power and profitability. Ultra-processing food is the food sector's most profitable business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-food-is-harming-mens-health-in-three-key-ways"&gt;Ultra-Processed Food Is Harming Men's Health in Three Key Ways&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest transnationals sit atop global supply, marketing and lobbying networks that expand markets, shape science and public debate, and block regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182375" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182375" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/supermarket_shelves_processed_food_642.jpg" alt="supermarket shelves stocked with processed foods" class="wp-image-182375 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/supermarket_shelves_processed_food_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/supermarket_shelves_processed_food_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182375" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Markets are heavily shaped by transnational brands.

&lt;li&gt;disrupt the ultra-processed food business model, by taxing ultra-processed foods production, mandating corporate plastics recycling, and redirecting resources to support healthy food producers and families&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;protect policymaking and science from interference, with conflict-of-interest safeguards and clear rules of engagement for industry. We should end reliance on industry self-regulation and use public policy and law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build coalitions to advocate to policymakers and drive policy change, from legal support to strategic communications.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new study, published by researchers at the University of California, Riverside, revisited the link between an emerging health risk and heart disease, uncovering alarming new details, according to a &lt;a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2025/11/18/microplastics-hit-male-arteries-hard" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-happening"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/polyamide-microplastics-study-rat-ingestion/" target="_blank"&gt;Microplastics&lt;/a&gt; — plastic particulate matter measuring 5 millimeters or smaller, often invisible to the naked eye — were not identified until &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/what-are-microplastics-oceans-harmful/" target="_blank"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, researchers have studied both their prevalence in the &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastics-in-soil-impact-agriculture/" target="_blank"&gt;environment&lt;/a&gt; and their impact on it, &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/plastic-pollution-in-forests-india/" target="_blank"&gt;wildlife&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastics-human-health-guide/" target="_blank"&gt;human health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have linked microplastics and &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastic-in-arterial-buildup-heart-attack-patients/" target="_blank"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;. The new research, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412025006890#ak005" target="_blank"&gt;Environment International&lt;/a&gt;, drilled down on that connection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers studied the effects of microplastics on mice, exposing them to daily levels equivalent to standard human exposure. They determined microplastics "dramatically worsened atherosclerosis" in several of the mice — but only male subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-9303ec5561ff8c22b537c317556e7f16 theco-biolite-woah-widget" id="theco-9303ec5561ff8c22b537c317556e7f16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-15d3260720f689ff3e28d7054970e669 theco-rewiring-america-widget-woah" id="theco-15d3260720f689ff3e28d7054970e669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-7ae0ee2aea4d44cff37c7d3ad23acb1e theco-saveon-energy-widget-programmatic" id="theco-7ae0ee2aea4d44cff37c7d3ad23acb1e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-1c3cb600d72eeb104d5fa5cc9258453e theco-trashie-widget-woah" id="theco-1c3cb600d72eeb104d5fa5cc9258453e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-4a04f2ad6c5f9de7f19edfa466e5c4cc theco-recurrent-woah-widget" id="theco-4a04f2ad6c5f9de7f19edfa466e5c4cc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-77faca96699e5fa799fba10c6fc66842 theco-greenportfolio-woah" id="theco-77faca96699e5fa799fba10c6fc66842"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-70e58d09baad5a27ef683ee5468edca2 theco-energysage-heat-pump-programmatic" id="theco-70e58d09baad5a27ef683ee5468edca2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/atherosclerosis" target="_blank"&gt;Atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt; is the medical term for debris, like fats, that accumulate on artery walls, and the press release indicated microplastics exposure worsened that buildup by "63% in the aortic root" and "624% in the brachiocephalic artery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-423eb154b4936e22e5b3d13e50d641f1 theco-nolan-interior-permalink" id="theco-423eb154b4936e22e5b3d13e50d641f1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-are-these-findings-concerning"&gt;Why are these findings concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To say something "is everywhere" is typically understood to be &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hyperbole" target="_blank"&gt;hyperbole&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="theco-inline-advertorial theco-target" id="theco-1104095078" data-theco-trackid="600611" data-theco-trackbid="1"&gt;	&lt;div&gt;

                    &lt;td class="section-inner"&gt;

                      &lt;/p&gt;
                      &lt;h1&gt;Stay warm all winter long with the Apple of intelligent space heaters&lt;/h1&gt;
                      &lt;a href="https://links.thecooldown.com/boldr-kelvin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
                   &lt;p&gt;Kelvin is the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://links.thecooldown.com/boldr-kelvin"&gt;Apple of space heaters&lt;/a&gt;, designed for energy efficiency and maximum comfort. It's completely silent and intelligently controlled, &lt;b&gt;with setup taking just 5 minutes&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built from &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://links.thecooldown.com/boldr-kelvin"&gt;premium materials&lt;/a&gt; like aluminum and glass, Kelvin works beautifully as a full-home heating system or as the &lt;b&gt;perfect solution&lt;/b&gt; for that one room that never feels warm enough.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;			
		
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="theco-35282c31bdc30ca3b51955b869a0ec8c theco-embedded-video" id="theco-35282c31bdc30ca3b51955b869a0ec8c"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the unfortunate case of the relatively novel problem of microplastics, it's not an exaggeration. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastics-are-everywhere-biologist-richard-thompson/" target="_blank"&gt;Microplastics&lt;/a&gt; were first discovered by a marine biologist, leading scientists to discover that the &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastic-pollution-study-global-trend/" target="_blank"&gt;oceans are awash&lt;/a&gt; in this pervasive form of &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tag/plastic/" target="_blank"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt; pollution. However, they're also in &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/microplastics-soil-crops-agriculture-study/" target="_blank"&gt;the soil&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn contaminates the &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/sustainable-food/nanoplastics-soil-plant-absorption-study/" target="_blank"&gt;food we grow&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/nanoplastics-in-farm-animal-cells/" target="_blank"&gt;meat we consume&lt;/a&gt;. They're also airborne, meaning we breathe &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/airborne-nanoplastics-microplastics/" target="_blank"&gt;microplastic-tainted air&lt;/a&gt; indoors and out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-569803b7369ddae7d46c610c4fade592 theco-recurrent-2-woah-widget" id="theco-569803b7369ddae7d46c610c4fade592"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If microplastics were harmless, this pollution would still be a problem — but in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-business/how-microplastics-affect-heart-health/" target="_blank"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, traces of the contaminant have been found in human &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastics-semen-fertility-study/" target="_blank"&gt;reproductive systems&lt;/a&gt;, and research has linked exposure to microplastics to certain &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastics-endometrial-cancer-research-women/" target="_blank"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-being-done-about-it"&gt;What's being done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"As microplastic pollution continues to rise worldwide, understanding its impacts on human health — including heart disease — is becoming more urgent than ever," said lead author Changcheng Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Research into microplastics is indeed critical, and new information on how microplastics affect the environment and living organisms is routinely studied and published — but acting on these findings on a &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-business/global-plastic-treaty-negotiations-fail/" target="_blank"&gt;global scale&lt;/a&gt; takes time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Individuals can take several steps to reduce their direct exposure to &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/plastic-takeout-containers-microplastics-college-students/" target="_blank"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt;, even if, as Zhou observed, it is "nearly impossible to avoid microplastics completely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-3692d7861b1e4080054af2e2d4354483 theco-ad-after-12th-p" id="theco-3692d7861b1e4080054af2e2d4354483"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He advised &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" target="_blank"&gt;using less plastic&lt;/a&gt;, particularly &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/avoid-single-use-items-when-you-travel/" target="_blank"&gt;single-use plastic&lt;/a&gt; items, and replacing your most-used things with &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/choose-plastic-free-options-for-everyday-products" target="_blank"&gt;plastic-free alternatives&lt;/a&gt; is also effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zhou also recommended avoiding &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/single-use-plastic-danger-human-health-water-bottles/" target="_blank"&gt;plastic water bottles&lt;/a&gt;, a major source of microplastic exposure, as well as eschewing &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/ditch-plastic-food-containers/" target="_blank"&gt;plastic food containers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Her health significantly declined over the years as she dealt with a slew of symptoms, including daily chronic pain, nausea and vomiting. For the past 10 years, she’s also been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN), being fed through IVs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My bowel acts as if it’s blocked but there’s nothing actually blocking it. It’s just the nerves don’t work so, as gross as this is, my stools would back up so much that I would throw it up or drain out my tummy,” she told &lt;a href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/25yearold-australian-woman-plans-to-take-her-own-life/news-story/23449344e21219d5428d41ccc8cd741f" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:News AU;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;News AU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had feeding tubes placed in me and I was still vomiting and then we discovered that my stomach wasn’t emptying so I was put on TPN,” she continued. “Because of the line straight into your bloodstream, if you get an infection it turns to sepsis really quickly which is very, very, dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until Annaliese turned 18 and transitioned from her pediatric facility to the general hospital that she was finally diagnosed. She learned that she had &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22781-autoimmune-autonomic-ganglionopathy#:~:text=Autoimmune%20autonomic%20ganglionopathy%20%28AAG%29%20is,dizzy%20when%20you%20stand%20up." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy&lt;/a&gt;, a rare neurological disease that damages the nerves that control heart rate, blood pressure, digestion and urination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By age 22, Annaliese was told that her condition was terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annaliese now has multi-organ failure and has survived sepsis 25 times. Her strong medications have caused her to develop severe osteoporosis. She’s fractured her spine in four places, cracked her sternum in half and has nearly crushed her heart and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steroids have also caused necrosis — a condition where the blood supply to her bones has failed — resulting in her teeth blackening and starting to fall out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/p&gt; Annaliese Holland&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was so miserable,” she said. “You can’t change it so you have to just deal with it really. Even though there’s beautiful moments in my days, they are exhausting and long. I’m in chronic debilitating pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I missed out on formals, graduations, my 18th, 21st [birthdays], they were all in hospitals being really sick. All my friends, they’re having babies, getting engaged, married. Everyone’s life is moving and I’m just stuck. I’m not living. I’m surviving every day, which is tough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-puzzler-8620185" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

Play now&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annaliese said her disease is like “walking on a field of landmines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It got to the point where she now no longer wants to endure the pain, sharing with her family that she wants to “die on my own terms” with medical aid in dying. What solidified her decision was seeing herself in the mirror one day while hospitalized and not even recognizing herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t me and I was so exhausted,” she said. “Life for me now is getting up each day doing what I need to do medically, taking the painkillers, trying to get through the day, just to go to bed and do it all again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have the most incredible team of doctors and nurses who have watched what I have been through and I told them I don’t want this anymore,” she admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the idea is heartbreaking for her parents and sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annaliese’s mother, Armanda, said she’s always hoping for a miracle but she “knows realistically what challenges” her daughter faces. But her father, Patrick, told the outlet that he’s seen her overcome every setback and knows she can get past the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every time she goes to the hospital, she fights for her own life,” Patrick said, holding back tears. “The amount of times Annie has been in hospital and on her deathbed… to have to sit there and watch her go through it … but she is amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember talking to my dad in the kitchen one night and I said, ‘Dad, I’ve had enough.’ And he went, ‘So you’re giving up?’” Annaliese shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annaliese said the moment that helped her dad come to terms with her decision was when she was in the hospital after being resuscitated by doctors. She pleaded with him, “Dad, please let me go. I will not hate you if you let me go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I said, ‘If this happens again, I don’t want anything. And please know that in my heart, you letting me go and saying no to treatment…I’m happy with and that’s what I want,’” she recalled, bursting into tears. “He turned to me and goes, ‘I don’t know how you do it and I totally understand that you’ve had enough.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;news.com.au/YouTube&lt;/p&gt; Annaliese Holland&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, three weeks after speaking to psychologists and going through the qualification process, Annaliese was approved for voluntary assisted dying (VAD), which she calls her “safety blanket” and a weight off her shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical aid in dying (MAID) is legal in every state in Australia for those who are terminally ill, mentally competent adults. MAID or VAD are different from euthanasia — which is illegal — because the patients themselves administer prescribed drugs to end their lives, rather than a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s so weird to be happy, but I was so happy when I found out I was approved, I was crying,” Annaliese said. “It’s hard because for me I am in pain and then I am at peace, but then I put the pain onto my family. You have this battle in your head of not wanting to hurt them so I will put some thought into how it will happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me, I don’t want to have to wake up every day with anxiety about the pain that I know is ahead for me. The pain of starving to death when they can’t feed me anymore, or the horror of sepsis. Knowing I can go when the time is right is just a huge relief,” she explained. “I feel so lucky that I do have this choice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She adds, “It’s one of the bravest things you could ever do, to say I want VAD. It’s not giving up. You’ve had enough and you fought bloody hard."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/25-year-old-terminal-illness-medical-aid-in-dying-11851857" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>aol.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 23:37:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5zSndCSUpxSnY5VTdJckFRYkw2eGwxb0JVQkt1YThqM19KLTE2MXFhUzE2a0xZUnByVEpIX3BlenNzbV9IaEFyMVREcFRuclE5RjVBUTZHTXN5Q3loNHlKdk1RY1B0R0UwMGFYNHhfN3Y</guid></item><item><title>研究人员发现多动症和早晨皮质醇之间复杂的遗传联系- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/researchers-uncover-complex-genetic-ties-between-adhd-and-morning-cortisol/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests the connection between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and the body’s primary stress hormone, cortisol, is not one of direct cause and effect. Instead, the two appear to share a complex genetic foundation, pointing toward common biological pathways that regulate arousal and behavior. The research, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2025.107587" target="_blank"&gt;Psychoneuroendocrinology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, helps refine scientific understanding of the physiological underpinnings of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder is a common neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. For some time, researchers have investigated its relationship with the body’s stress response system, formally known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. This system’s main product is cortisol, a hormone that follows a natural daily rhythm, typically peaking in the morning to promote wakefulness and declining throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this system also governs general arousal levels, which are thought to be regulated differently in individuals with ADHD, scientists have explored whether cortisol levels might be linked to the condition. Some previous analyses of multiple studies indicated that people with ADHD, particularly youths, tend to have lower baseline levels of morning cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, results across individual studies have been inconsistent, leaving the nature of this relationship ambiguous. It was not clear if cortisol differences contributed to ADHD, if ADHD itself altered cortisol regulation, or if another factor linked them both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this question, a team of researchers from institutions in Brazil and Denmark turned to genetics. Led by scientists at the University of São Paulo and the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, the group used large-scale genetic data to dissect the biological connection between ADHD and morning cortisol levels. Their approach was designed to move beyond simple correlation and test for causal links and shared genetic architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers first employed a powerful statistical method known as Mendelian Randomization. This technique uses genetic variants as a proxy for an exposure, in this case, morning cortisol levels. Because a person’s genes are randomly assigned at conception and generally remain fixed, this method can help determine if an exposure causes an outcome without the confounding influence of environmental or lifestyle factors. The analysis drew on genetic data from two massive datasets: one for ADHD that included over 225,000 people and one for morning cortisol levels from over 25,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After applying seven different Mendelian Randomization models, the team found no evidence of a causal relationship in either direction. Genetically predicted morning cortisol levels did not appear to increase the likelihood of having ADHD. Similarly, a genetic predisposition for ADHD did not seem to cause alterations in morning cortisol levels. This result suggested that a simple, direct causal link was unlikely and that a more complex connection might exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the team searched for evidence of pleiotropy, a phenomenon where the same genes influence multiple, seemingly unrelated traits. They started by conducting a global genetic correlation analysis, which scans the entire genome to see if the genetic factors for ADHD and cortisol overlap on a broad scale. This analysis did not find a significant overall correlation, indicating that on a genome-wide level, the two traits do not share substantial genetic influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation then shifted to a more fine-grained approach. Using a technique called Local Analysis of Variant Association, the researchers zoomed in on 2,495 specific segments of the genome to search for localized regions of genetic overlap. Here, they made a key discovery. They identified two distinct genomic regions, one on chromosome 5 and another on chromosome 22, where the genetics of ADHD and morning cortisol were significantly linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nature of these links was bidirectional. The region on chromosome 5 showed a negative correlation, meaning that genetic variants associated with a higher likelihood of ADHD were also associated with lower morning cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the region on chromosome 22 showed a positive correlation, where genetic variants linked to a higher likelihood of ADHD were tied to higher morning cortisol levels. This mixture of positive and negative associations in different parts of the genome helps explain why the global analysis found no overall effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genes located within these two regions, such as RASGRF2 and TRIOBP, have previously been implicated in a range of psychiatric conditions, cognitive functions, and risk-taking behaviors. An additional analysis designed to pinpoint single genetic markers associated with both traits identified one variant located within a gene called ZNF652-AS1. This marker has also been connected in other research to behaviors related to impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see how these genetic predispositions play out in people, the researchers conducted a final analysis in an independent group of 1,660 Brazilian adults, some with ADHD and some without. For each person, they calculated a polygenic score, which summarizes an individual’s genetic tendency toward higher or lower morning cortisol. The team then tested if this score was associated with having an ADHD diagnosis or other co-occurring psychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cortisol polygenic score was not directly associated with having an ADHD diagnosis on its own. It was, however, associated with the presence of other conditions known as externalizing disorders. A higher genetic predisposition for morning cortisol was linked to a greater likelihood of having a substance use disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or antisocial personality disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers statistically accounted for the presence of these co-occurring conditions, a new pattern emerged: a lower cortisol polygenic score was then associated with ADHD. This finding suggests the link between cortisol genetics and ADHD may be partly masked or mediated by related behavioral conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the study’s results argue against a direct causal pathway between cortisol and ADHD. Instead, they support a model of localized pleiotropy, where specific sets of genes influence both the body’s arousal systems and the behaviors characteristic of ADHD. The researchers propose that these findings align with an “inverted U-shaped” model of physiological regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this view, optimal functioning occurs at a moderate level of arousal, and deviations in either direction, resulting in either too low or too high cortisol, could be associated with ADHD-related traits. This perspective reframes ADHD not just as a disorder of attention, but as a condition involving broader systemic dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has some limitations. The large genetic datasets used for the initial analyses were drawn predominantly from individuals of European ancestry, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other populations. The polygenic score analysis in the Brazilian sample highlighted this, as the associations were primarily detected in the subgroup of participants with greater European ancestry. The clinical sample for the polygenic score analysis was also modest in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build on these findings by examining these genetic links in larger and more diverse populations. Integrating genetic data with direct, repeated measurements of cortisol levels in individuals over time would also help to clarify how these shared genetic factors influence the body’s hormonal dynamics from day to day. Such work would continue to illuminate the complex biological interplay that contributes to ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2025.107587" target="_blank"&gt;Shared biological pathways linking ADHD and cortisol variability are related to externalizing behaviors&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by João K.N.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Texas — Texas’ top agriculture official is urging horse owners to keep a close eye on their animals after an outbreak of Equine Herpesvirus Type 1 (EHV-1) was linked to the recent World Championship Barrel Racing Finals in the Waco area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warning led to at least one Houston-area horse arena closing for the time being. &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/commprecinct2.org/posts/pfbid02tP2athdDimvHYFuT1iPxNyhUjwJQYSxDc4MYHPqtuZ8Nv3VhZyCu1XQHoRGSmFPyl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;According to Montgomery County Precinct 2 Commissioner Charlie Riley&lt;/a&gt;, the Magnolia Horse Arena was closed "out of an abundance of caution" due to the EHV-1 outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montgomery County Precinct 1 Commissioner Robert Walker announced that the Willis Ag Arena would be closed due to the outbreak, too. All scheduled events were canceled, and the matter will be reassessed on Dec. 8.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear how many horses have died as a result of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller and the Texas Department of Agriculture issued a public alert Wednesday, asking anyone who attended, transported horses to, or was near the event from Nov. 5-9 to act quickly and take extra precautions. Miller emphasized that even small changes can be early signs.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This virus can spread fast, it can be deadly, and the earliest signs are often so subtle they’re easy to miss. That’s why monitoring your horses right now is critical. The quicker we identify a potential case, the better chance we have to protect not only our animals, but the entire Texas equine community," Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particularly aggressive strain of EHV-1 has now been confirmed by Central Texas veterinarians. The department said horse owners who attended the Waco event, whose horses have mingled with those that went, or who attended any large equine gathering nearby in the last 14 days, should be on alert.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs of EHV-1 can range from fever or nasal discharge to depression, stumbling, weakness or loss of tail tone, and even abortions in pregnant mares. The virus can spread directly by nose-to-nose contact or through the air when infected horses cough or sneeze, and can also travel on equipment, tack, buckets, and even human hands or clothing.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department recommends isolating horses that attended the event for at least 14 days, suspending all event travel for exposed horses, disinfecting all shared equipment, monitoring temperatures twice daily, and contacting a veterinarian immediately if fever or other symptoms appear. Any horse showing respiratory or neurological symptoms should be isolated right away, and handlers should use protective gear.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller urged the Texas horse community to act fast.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m asking every local horse rider, roper, trainer, and breeder to do their part today. Check your horses twice a day, isolate any exposed animals, tighten up your biosecurity, and call your vet the moment something looks off. If we work together and take this seriously, we can get ahead of this outbreak and keep our horses and our state’s $12.3 billion equine industry safe," Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owners are also advised to keep detailed records and stay in touch with their veterinarian and state authorities for updates.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

This particular mutated strain of Influenza has gained dominance in many countries, including Japan, the U.K. and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Japan declared an influenza epidemic after experiencing a surge of flu infections. The U.K. has also experienced a wave of early flu infections. Although flu activity in the United States remains low, cases are on the rise and the dominant strain currently is Influenza A H3N2, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s what to know about the H3N2 strain of the Influenza type A virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;Influenza H3N2 Symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common symptoms associated with H3N2 are similar to all Influenza flu viruses and include fever, cough, runny nose, fatigue, muscle aches and chills. However, infection with this strain tends to be more severe across all age groups, particularly children and the elderly. Specifically, patients with H3N2 can experience higher fevers that can then lead to complications, such as difficulty breathing, dehydration and hospitalizations. This was a major concern during the last flu season that was dominated by H3N2 in &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5607250/flu-season-h3n2-influenza-virus-shot" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5607250/flu-season-h3n2-influenza-virus-shot" aria-label="2016-2017"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5607250/flu-season-h3n2-influenza-virus-shot"&gt;2016-2017&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;Is The Mutated Subclade K Dominant In America?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Influenza A H3N2 strain is currently causing the majority of cases in the United States, it is unclear if the subclade K is the culprit for the dominance of cases. This is because during the 44 day government shutdown, flu cases were not being tracked by the CDC, making it difficult to assess trends in the last several weeks. In addition, the CDC has not published data on specific subclades circulating in its latest &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/index.html" aria-label="FluView"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/index.html"&gt;FluView&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report. It is also unclear if the CDC will publish this type of data in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Subclade K was first identified in June in Europe, and has been spreading across the northern hemisphere since. This particular subclade has picked up seven mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;Will This Year’s Flu Shot Protect Against Subclade K?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="MWrh7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current 2025-2026 flu vaccine is a trivalent vaccine that offers protection against two Influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) as well as one type of Influenza B strain. Although the vaccine offers protection against the H3N2 strain, it does not cover the mutated subclade K since the vaccine began formulation in February, well before subclade K came into the picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this does not mean that individuals should not get vaccinated. The purpose of vaccination is not to avoid infection all together, but rather to decrease the risk of severe illness, hospitalization and death. Since the vaccine offers protection against H3N2, getting the vaccine will offer some protection against subclade K, although it is not a perfect match against it. Data from the U.K. showed up to 75% protection for children against subclade K and up to 40% for adults when considering hospitalizations, according to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5607250/flu-season-h3n2-influenza-virus-shot" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5607250/flu-season-h3n2-influenza-virus-shot" aria-label="NPR"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5607250/flu-season-h3n2-influenza-virus-shot"&gt;NPR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;How Can You Stay Healthy Amid Flu Season?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several actions you can take to keep you and your loved ones healthy during the flu season, which typically peaks between December and February. The first is to get vaccinated with the flu shot. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recommends everyone age 6 months and older to get the flu vaccine. In addition, avoiding crowded indoor areas where respiratory viruses can spread easily can be helpful. If necessary to go into those spaces, consider wearing a N95 or KN95 mask to decrease the chance of inhaling virus particles. Finally, washing hands regularly for 20 seconds and covering coughs and sneezes can go a long way in decreasing your chance of becoming infected with the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Forbes</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 22:36:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxON1h4RVNFT3E4bk55WVpBZk93TVllVFljR1g5ZHNkSWMta0NieFg2dTdPazAwb1QyTW5OeFB2bWRHb1JhY05KR1VPOGRIaDdqOXV1SS1MUHBnRzhWTmVGMkd0N0hNNHpwMmdvUEk5d3hYV3h3ZDRUakRkUVdFZDRkaHozd3pENUJXX25GeTlWdGkwamR3bnNZNGdYVmdraFViN0lQcW1QQ0RKMFl2cy1ZN2NEZ0N2aWRyTXIxZXNn</guid></item><item><title>实验性mRNA流感疫苗比常规流感疫苗更有效，但会导致更多的副作用- CIDRAP</title><link>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-general/experimental-mrna-flu-vaccine-more-effective-conventional-flu-shot-causes-more</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recent mutations in circulating influenza viruses &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/absent-cdc-and-mismatched-subclade-k-flu-strain-experts-face-upcoming-season"&gt;&lt;span&gt;could make flu shots less effective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; this year, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/flu-season-in-the-us"&gt;&lt;span&gt;leading to an especially brutal flu season&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not a new problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Flu viruses are infamous for their ability to evolve quickly and without warning, creating a mismatch between the shots already on the market and the viral strains spreading from person to person. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the past 15 years, the effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccines &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-vaccines-work/php/effectiveness-studies/index.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;has ranged from 19% to 60%,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A big part of the problem is that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/fdas-critical-role-ensuring-safe-and-effective-flu-vaccines#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20U.S.%20flu,based%20and%20recombinant%20protein%20vaccines."&gt;&lt;span&gt;most flu vaccines today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; use a slow process in which influenza viruses are grown in fertilized eggs, a technique first &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cslseqirus.com.au/manufacturing/technologies#:~:text=Egg%2Dbased%20production,production%20will%20continue%20to%20evolve."&gt;&lt;span&gt;used in the 1940s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Making flu vaccines this way requires huge numbers of eggs and takes about six months. In order for flu vaccines to be ready by fall, researchers have to choose which viral strains to include by February, according to Bill Hanage, PhD, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“An issue with eggs in vaccine production is that the virus can adapt to the eggs, and the mutations involved in that reduce the match to the target strain and reduce the efficacy,” Hanage told CIDRAP News. “If you are growing things in eggs, it takes more time and a lot of eggs, which may be in short supply” due to bird flu outbreaks that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2025/02/26/killing-166-million-birds-hasnt-helped-poultry-farmers-stop-h5n1-is-there-a-better-way/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;have killed or led to the culling of millions of chickens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists have looked for solutions for years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The search for more effective flu vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Holy Grail of flu vaccines would be a “universal flu shot,” which &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/research-context-progress-toward-universal-vaccines#:~:text=The%20vaccine%2C%20called%20FluMos%2Dv1,vaccination%5D%2C%E2%80%9D%20Bok%20says."&gt;&lt;span&gt;would protect against many strains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of influenza and protect people for multiple years, for more than a decade. Progress has been slow going.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two newer types of flu vaccines that are more effective than egg-based vaccines and which can be made more quickly, said Amesh Adalja, MD, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. The FDA approved the first flu shots &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/vaccines/novartis-receives-fda-approval-for-flucelvax%C2%AE-first-cell-culture-vaccine-us-to-help#:~:text=Basel%2C%20November%2020%2C%202012%20%E2%80%93,years%20of%20age%20and%20older3."&gt;&lt;span&gt;made in cell cultures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in 2012, as well as flu vaccines &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccine-types/flublok-vaccine.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;made with recombinant technology that are created synthetically in labs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in 2013.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-right"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But given how much flu vaccine manufacturers have invested in egg-based production, most have been slow to transition to new technology, Adalja said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“More manufacturers should move away from egg-based vaccines,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“With non-egg based vaccines, decisions about strain selection could be delayed until closer to the season’s start, lessening the chance of a vaccine strain mismatch,” Adalja explained. “Also, during a pandemic a vaccine could be made more quickly. During the last influenza pandemic, in 2009, the bulk of the egg-based pandemic vaccine was being administered after the peak of viral activity.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;More manufacturers should move away from egg-based vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the most promising vaccine technologies uses modified mRNA, a platform that allowed manufacturers to rapidly produce hundreds of millions of COVID-19 shots during the pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hanage said a safe and effective flu shot made with mRNA could be a game changer, allowing manufacturers to quickly respond to genetic mutations in circulating viruses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It would obviously be really helpful to rapidly produce a matched vaccine offering better protection,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trial finds higher efficacy with mRNA flu shot&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results of a large clinical trial, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2416779?query=featured_home"&gt;&lt;span&gt;published today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, show that researchers are making progress on experimental mRNA flu shots, even if they aren’t yet ready to be rolled out to consumers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the study, people randomly assigned to receive a flu shot made with modified mRNA were 29% less likely to be diagnosed with a lab-confirmed case of influenza by the end of winter than people given a conventional flu shot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The experimental mRNA vaccine prevented 60% to 67% of flu infections, while the conventional vaccine prevented 44% to 54% of infections, said Kelly Lindert, MD, vice president of clinical research and development at Pfizer and senior author of the new study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Authors of the study, which was funded by Pfizer, tested the experimental mRNA vaccine in more than 18,000 adults age 18 to 64 during the 2022-2023 flu season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This really is exciting and promising,” said Hanage, who was not involved in the new study. The modified mRNA vaccine “is plainly capable of protecting for at least a season and doing so better than the one with which it was being compared.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By showing that mRNA vaccines can help prevent seasonal influenza, the study “sets the stage for its use against pandemic influenza, when the rapid vaccine development process specific to mRNA vaccine technologies is critical,” said Adalja, who also was not involved in the new study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adalja noted that the study compared mRNA vaccines to Sanofi’s Fluzone, which is manufactured in eggs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So researchers don’t know how mRNA vaccines would measure up to flu shots that use newer technologies, Adalja added. Flucelvax, made by Seqirus, Inc. and first approved in 2012, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccine-types/cell-based.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;is grown in mammalian cells,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; rather than eggs. Flublok, a recombinant vaccine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/186627/download?attachment#:~:text=January%2016%2C%202013:%20Flublok%20was%20granted%20traditional,two%20pediatric%20PMRs%2C%20PSC08%20in%20children%20and"&gt;&lt;span&gt;approved in 2013&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and sold by Sanofi Pasteur, is created synthetically in a lab. Both of these vaccines have moderately higher efficacy rates than flu shots grown in eggs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Higher risk of side effects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mild to moderate side effects were much more common in those who received the mRNA shot, however.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;About 70% of adults given the mRNA vaccine developed redness, swelling, or pain in the part of their arm where they received the injection, compared with43% of those who received the traditional vaccine, according to the study, which included participants in the United States, South Africa, and the Philippines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;About two-thirds of those vaccinated with an mRNA flu shot developed a fever, headache, fatigue, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle pain or joint pain, compared with about half of those given the traditional vaccine. Although participants in the study were healthy or medically stable, one-quarter had at least one risk factor for severe influenza. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The number of serious side effects was low and about the same among people who received the mRNA or the traditional vaccine. For example, none of the study participants developed myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle that can lead to chest pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, and even heart failure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers will need to reduce the number of side effects to make mRNA shots palatable, Hanage said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;While there’s no evidence of an excess of really serious adverse events, there are clearly more of the moderate and not-pleasant adverse events,” Hanage said. “For many folks, this has been their dominant memory of COVID shots, and people will be reluctant to get vaccines on an annual basis which make them feel rotten.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Side effects are an especially important consideration for the healthy, younger adults included in the trial, most of whom aren’t at high risk of being hospitalized by the flu, Adalja said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People will be reluctant to get vaccines on an annual basis which make them feel rotten.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2514597"&gt;&lt;span&gt; an accompanying editorial,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; infectious disease specialists Hana M. El Sahly, MD, and Robert L. Atmar, MD, pointed out that the published study didn’t provide any information about the mRNA vaccine’s use in adults over 65 or people with chronic illness, who have the highest risk of hospitalization or death, or include children, who have the highest incidence of flu.. They note that the mRNA vaccine and conventional vaccine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05540522?cond=influenza&amp;amp;term=pfizer&amp;amp;rank=10&amp;amp;tab=results"&gt;&lt;span&gt;had similar efficacy in older adults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, although this data wasn’t included in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;New England Journal of Medicine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;article.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pfizer is developing a newer version of the mRNA flu shot that will be tested in adults age 65 and up, Lindert said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Loss of federal funding could stymie future vaccine development&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In one of the few success stories of the pandemic, the federal government worked with private companies on Operation Warp Speed, which brought COVID-19 vaccines to the public in less than a year. But in August, the Trump administration reversed course, announcing the cancellation of nearly $500 million in mRNA vaccine research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-left"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In spite of the promising research published today, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said it has no plans to restore mRNA vaccine funding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A spokesperson said the agency decided to “wind down federal mRNA vaccine development” after finding that “several emergency-funded projects no longer meet HHS’s current standards for transparency, reproducibility and long-term safety.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The federal health agency “is prioritizing vaccine platforms with stronger safety records and open clinical and manufacturing data, including whole-virus, protein-based, and next-generation adjuvanted technologies,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[This study] certainly shows that cutting the funding for research was a short sighted decision which sets us back significantly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That decision has been sharply criticized by many scientists and public health advocates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new mRNA study published today “certainly shows that cutting the funding for research was a short-sighted decision which sets us back significantly,” Hanage said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These results should excite anyone interested in preventing sickness and suffering due to influenza," he said. "The way to address these concerns is with more research, and that research will be slower and more difficult, or may not be possible at all, in the absence of funding.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Ever since the mRNA Covid vaccines were approved in 2020, experts have looked at flu as one of the next logical applications for the technology. No country has approved an mRNA flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6964ac" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said Pfizer’s mRNA flu vaccine could be “a game-changer,” potentially providing a closer match to the strains in any given flu season. One big reason flu shots aren’t as effective as they can be is because they aren’t a good match for the circulating virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0637c4" class="body-graf"&gt;Because it takes months to manufacture a traditional flu shot, Creech said, scientists must choose the strains to include in the vaccine about six to eight months before flu season begins. Developing an mRNA shot is typically faster, which could allow those decisions to be made later in the year — and give scientists more flexibility to pivot if the circulating strain changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc03ef" class="body-graf"&gt;“There remains a significant need for improved approaches to prevent influenza,” Creech said. The trial results, he said, provide “proof” that the mRNA shot has an advantage over traditional flu vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f551e" class="body-graf"&gt;Pfizer, however, may face an uphill battle to get the new vaccine approved, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas and co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-99fbbc" class="body-graf"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist, has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085"&gt;downplayed the benefits of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and has singled out vaccines made with mRNA as particularly dangerous, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccine-kids-pregnant-women-cdc-recommendation-rfk-jr-rcna207312"&gt;calling the mRNA Covid vaccine&lt;/a&gt; “the deadliest vaccine ever made.” Several states have introduced legislation to ban mRNA vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-60c9cc" class="body-graf"&gt;In August, the Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-cuts-500-million-mrna-vaccine-contracts-dealing-major-blow-prom-rcna223281"&gt;canceled nearly $500 million&lt;/a&gt; in funding into mRNA vaccine research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-df072e" class="body-graf"&gt;In May, Moderna, which also makes an mRNA Covid vaccine, withdrew its application seeking approval for its combination flu and Covid mRNA shot after the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/moderna-flu-covid-vaccine-fda-delay/746857/"&gt;asked for more data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-188133" class="body-graf"&gt;“Despite all the advantages of mRNA, I’m concerned that our current DHHS has no or little interest in the science,” Hotez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c806e" class="body-graf"&gt;HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1461e9" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Kelly Lindert, Pfizer’s vice president of clinical research and development, said in an email that the company is “in discussion with health authorities on the path to licensure of mRNA influenza vaccines.” She declined to comment on the timeline for submission or approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f57c82" class="body-graf"&gt;The new trial, funded by Pfizer, compared the company’s mRNA shot to Fluzone, one of the most widely used seasonal flu vaccines in the U.S. More than 18,000 adults, most of them in the U.S., were randomly assigned to get either shot during the 2022-2023 flu season. Other trial sites included South Africa and the Philippines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ace139" class="body-graf"&gt;The trial found Pfizer’s shot cut flu-like illnesses by 34.5% compared to Fluzone — 57 cases in the mRNA group versus 87 cases in the Fluzone group. Nearly all infections were caused by two common influenza A strains: H3N2 and H1N1. The Pfizer vaccine also protected against two influenza B strains, the Victoria strain and the Yamagata strain. The Yamagata strain fell out of circulation during the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-48917d" class="body-graf"&gt;Both flu shots caused side effects, including arm pain and fatigue, though they were more common in people who got the mRNA flu shot compared to the traditional vaccine. A small percentage — 5.6% — of people who got the mRNA vaccine reported fevers, compared to 1.7% in the traditional flu shot group. Most side effects were mild to moderate and went away within 1 to 2 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ef7bb7" class="body-graf"&gt;Creech said it’s not surprising that the mRNA vaccine caused more side effects, given that it generated a stronger immune response.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-951429" class="body-graf"&gt;“In some ways, this is like training for a race,” Creech said. “We may have a little bit of muscle soreness or fatigue after a training run, but by having a little bit of discomfort then, we can avoid overwhelming fatigue or soreness during the race.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f041f1" class="body-graf"&gt;Lindert said it’s plausible people are reporting more side effects due to “the cascade of events from the activation of the immune response.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ccee36" class="body-graf"&gt;“The relationship between side effects and immune responses is the source of ongoing discussion in the scientific community,” Lindert said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fb9a97" class="body-graf"&gt;Moderna is also still working on a stand-alone mRNA flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1f0ca" class="body-graf"&gt;In June, the company reported results from a late-stage trial in older adults, finding its mRNA flu shot was about 27% more effective than an approved flu shot made by GSK. The company said people who got its shot had side effects that were similar to those seen with other flu vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ed2dcc" class="body-graf"&gt;Creech said “not all mRNA vaccines are created the same,” adding that it’s not surprising Pfizer’s and Moderna’s shots could have different efficacy levels and side effect profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-577d84" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Moderna said the company plans to file for approval for its stand-alone flu vaccine by January 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 22:02:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxOelQ2N2tfX3ZkY1Y0RVdrWUx5WnZTQkRIRFdabkhuRjVLUHd5ZDI4TDd1RDYtSFFxTkFpZUlyTmYxMnJ2ZW0xOHhDaG1lV2xyb0FvTnRSd1NVN0k0THRZb3RPUWdQYzE4ZVVZUy15QUhzWTl3Ri0zX0xiNE1VWWVrZVZYZU9PeDJybGMxMG1HRzlrbXd6RVd6Z1puVXNMREZMZ25zQ0VCUWhUOWNJUjFmZm54UjRtbzZFajA4T1ZBbGdWQdIBVkFVX3lxTE1DeDFad1A1ZDBva1pEQXptZGVDZl9lZDVMZV9hV296ZE5TdV9nejhDMFJXakl1dF9sNDFPeU81VFZqajVuNUZFdk5lb2pMSFFreGYxZk53</guid></item><item><title>研究人员正在寻找减肥药物副作用的解决方案- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5611473/researchers-are-looking-for-solutions-for-side-effects-of-weight-loss-drugs</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound are highly effective for weight loss. But researchers at the Society for Neuroscience meeting say they are only beginning to understand the drugs' effects on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound are helping millions of Americans shed pounds, but these drugs affect the brain in ways that can cause nausea and other side effects. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports on researchers at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego who are trying to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: They're called GLP-1 drugs, and they mimic a hormone that reduces appetite and slows digestion. Warren Yacawych of the University of Michigan says, unfortunately, nearly half the people who take the drugs feel sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WARREN YACAWYCH: They lose weight, which is a positive thing, but they experience such severe nausea and vomiting that patients stop treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: So Yacawych and his colleagues wanted to know if they could suppress appetite without making people queasy. He says they focused on two areas in the brain stem where GLP-1 drugs have a big effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YACAWYCH: The first is affectionately known as the brain stem's vomit center. It's naturally designed to detect any accidentally ingested toxin and coordinate the feeling of nausea and the vomit response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: The second area monitors food intake and tells you when you're full. So the team altered mice in a way that allowed GLP-1 to reach the area involved in feeling full but not the vomit center. The mice didn't get sick, but Yacawych says they also didn't get thin - probably because certain cells in the vomit center are critical to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YACAWYCH: And so it's very challenging, we think, right now to be able to separate these side effects, like nausea, from GLP-1's intended effects, like weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: One possible workaround came from researchers at the University of Washington. They gave obese rats a low dose of a GLP-1 drug along with the hormone oxytocin, which is itself an appetite suppressant. That allowed the rats to lose weight without feeling sick. Another side effect of GLP-1 drugs is a decrease in thirst. Derek Daniels of the University at Buffalo says this could be dangerous for people who are already losing lots of fluids from side effects like vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEREK DANIELS: If you're in that state of dehydration and you're not feeling thirsty to replace those fluids, you can understand why that would be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: To understand how GLP-1 drugs affect thirst, Daniels and a team began studying rats, and they got lucky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DANIELS: We had a happy accident in the lab, and the happy accident involved a rat called a Brattleboro rat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: This animal is thirsty pretty much all the time, except when it gets a GLP-1 drug. This led the team to the brain area causing this change. Daniels says that discovery could be important in efforts to reduce side effects from GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DANIELS: It now gives an opportunity to maybe design drugs that will target the good places and not the bad places. And I would think of a place that suppresses thirst as a bad place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Another team found that GLP-1 drugs are already targeting a place that plays a role in addiction as well as eating. It's a brain area involved in emotion and the reward system. Ali Guler of the University of Virginia says when GLP-1 is delivered to this brain area in mice, it doesn't affect their appetite for healthy foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALI GULER: But if you do the same treatment and provide them with a rewarding food like a burger, the animals have actually a reduced intake of this food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: It's the mouse equivalent of choosing a salad instead of dessert. And Guler says scientists should be able to develop versions of GLP-1 drugs that work the same way - by targeting the reward system while avoiding brain areas involved in appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GULER: If we are able to do this, then we can use it for different types of treatments, such as substance use disorder like alcoholism or drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Doctors and researchers have already observed that people taking GLP-1 drugs for weight loss or diabetes tend to consume less alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jon Hamilton, NPR News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF AYANNA SONG, "GIRLFRIEND")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But apart from exercise and healthy diet, there is something else that fuels the brain. That aspect is social connections. Yes, that is right! Social disconnection stands as a hidden brain-damaging factor, which causes memory problems, and can even shrink your brain! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9750173/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; indicates that social connections between people, determine how their brains age and function. Social connections beyond emotional benefits, help people stay mentally alert, while reducing inflammation and protecting their brain size and memory storage capacity. Austin Perlmutter, MD, tells us more...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The Loneliness Epidemic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2025/07/16/over-80-of-adults-in-the-us-experience-loneliness-study/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in Forbes revealed that more than 80% of U.S. adults experience some level of loneliness, which affects people from all demographic groups. The researchers analysed 50,000 participants to establish that loneliness creates a higher danger for developing depression, poor physical health, and weakens immune system function. The problem extends beyond elderly populations because young and middle-aged people with lower incomes, and women face elevated risks of social isolation. Health professionals now recognise loneliness as a major public health issue, because it exists as a widespread silent condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 creative activities to boost brain power, sharpen memory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Social connection and brain health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who maintain strong social bonds through regular interaction, develop an effective defense system against cognitive deterioration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have proven that social participation builds up cognitive reserve, which enables the brain to handle aging changes and injuries. People who stay socially active, demonstrate superior mental flexibility and better memory functions and learning abilities, than those who live in isolation. The brain develops better problem-solving abilities and emotional control through social interactions, that involve multiple brain regions. People who maintain various social relationships between close friends, and family, achieve the best brain protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Loneliness and increased inflammation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physical effects of loneliness extend beyond emotional distress, because it triggers measurable changes in body stress systems, and inflammation responses. Research indicates that people who experience prolonged social isolation and loneliness, develop elevated levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, which are inflammatory markers linked to chronic diseases. The inflammatory markers increase heart disease and diabetes risks, while simultaneously causing damage to brain cells and blood vessels. People who maintain social connections show reduced inflammation levels and better stress management abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The link between loneliness and shrinking brain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11089178/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; using brain imaging techniques has validated psychologists' earlier predictions that social isolation leads to brain tissue reduction in areas responsible for memory, and thinking functions. Research conducted in 2024 demonstrated that people who experienced ongoing loneliness, developed smaller brain areas including frontal white matter and hippocampus, which serves as a critical memory storage center. The research results showed that loneliness directly affects brain structure, even after scientists controlled age-related factors, health conditions and depression symptoms. The brain shrinkage effect from loneliness could explain why lonely people develop higher risks of developing dementia, and Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Social isolation leads to memory loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research conducted over multiple years, demonstrates that severe social detachment accelerates memory deterioration in people. Research shows that social isolation leads to accelerated memory and language skill deterioration in both male and female participants, when compared to their socially engaged counterparts. The evidence demonstrates that social isolation actively causes cognitive deterioration, instead of being a result of poor memory function. Older adults who experience loneliness, perform poorly on memory tests, and show reduced verbal skills and decreased attention span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How social connection protects and enhances the brain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social connection stands as a powerful brain-protective factor, because it activates multiple brain regions during conversations and shared activities, which maintains neural network flexibility and strength. Social interactions bring down stress hormones while simultaneously increasing brain-protective substances, including oxytocin and dopamine. People who participate in social activities on a regular basis stimulate brain growth factors, which support the creation of new brain cells through a process known as neuroplasticity. People who participate in group activities such as volunteering, clubs or digital communities, experience mental stimulation and emotional support, which helps them maintain brain health during their senior years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Practical steps to protect brain health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step to defend memory and brain vitality, requires understanding how social isolation and loneliness create health risks. Daily social interaction through any small activity, helps people fight against loneliness. You can fight loneliness by making daily contact with friends through phone calls, and by participating in group activities and local community volunteer work. Activities that challenge your mind during social events, such as book clubs, games and discussions, provide the most benefit. People need to develop strong relationships with others, while making social interaction their top priority, because these factors protect their brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that social connections serve as an essential, yet underestimated tool to defend memory and brain volume throughout entire life span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8gFBVV95cUxQaHFVa1J5aGhoT1BCc0VNejVyRzBST1VUVjAzZ2FCNnBoWllUVV85cVZhMHpSTFFJY3ZOQzgyN3hCWmJPSHM3VjE3ekVMVmczLXlPQS1sN0pjYkRFeDI2ekFvb2d4N2ZQNzJCZGROSHRPOEF2MHhsY1AwTUV3aVFib09YOHFLMnltTEZ1NHJTWU52RmIxM0hjSXMzVnZOa2NBM012TXFYOW1UYWkyLWlHVUxxcTVNaHBuWHJYMTduM3BlRjlYLXVSbVRKMVpVMk9wU1lPMGJjbTl3d2NUN0w5a0gxa2hpamFyM29KSkN4LWtYQQ</guid></item><item><title>令人震惊的差异：女性面临更高的ECT风险-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/ect-women-mental-health-29958/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A large international survey of 858 electroconvulsive therapy recipients found that women are twice as likely as men to receive ECT and experience more adverse effects. Women reported higher rates of memory loss, greater feelings of coercion, and more harmful emotional outcomes, often describing the treatment as retraumatizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were also less likely to report mood improvement or willingness to undergo ECT again. The findings highlight systemic gender disparities in psychiatric care and call for a trauma-informed reassessment of ECT practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Risk for Women:&lt;/strong&gt; Women receive ECT twice as often as men and report worse outcomes, including long-term memory loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower Reported Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; Only 15% of women would choose ECT again, compared with 29% of men.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trauma and Coercion:&lt;/strong&gt; Women report more pressure to consent, less information about risks, and experiences resembling past trauma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of East London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An international survey has found that women are twice as likely as men to receive electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and are also more likely to experience long-term memory loss and other adverse effects as a result.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study – &lt;em&gt;Electroconvulsive therapy and women: an international survey&lt;/em&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Health Care for Women International&lt;/em&gt; – led by Professor John Read of the University of East London, gathered responses from 858 ECT recipients across 44 countries, 73% of whom were women. It is the largest survey of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ECT is administered to around a million people every year, the study found women fared worse on nearly every measure of outcome. Women were less likely to report improved mood and more likely to describe the treatment as harmful, with significantly higher rates of both short- and long-term memory loss. Only 15% of women said they would undergo ECT again, compared with 29% of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women also reported being given less information before treatment, facing greater pressure or coercion to consent, and receiving ECT from predominantly male psychiatrists – 81% worldwide and 88% in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the statistics, many women described their experiences as traumatic, echoing feelings of violation or loss of control. Accounts included being held down and “done to” against their will, reawakening memories of past abuse, and suffering lasting fear of future treatment. For some survivors of sexual violence, ECT was described as “another kind of rape – but of the mind”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Professor John Read, Professor of Clinical Psychology, University of East London, said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that women not only receive ECT more often but are also more likely to suffer its most damaging effects. These patterns cannot be dismissed as coincidence. They reflect systemic biases in psychiatry and underline the urgent need for a trauma-informed, feminist perspective on mental health care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three members of the research team have had ECT themselves and have spoken of their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisa Morrison, lead author (Belfast, Northern Ireland):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My experiences of rape and abuse were primarily treated with psychiatric drugs and ECT. Repeated inpatient admissions left me more and more unwell. The many diagnoses I received reinforced in me the devastating messages so many women internalise. I’m to blame. I’m bad. This is my shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There can’t be informed consent without being told the risks.  Despite all the evidence showing otherwise, they still tell us it’s safe and effective. Those who have the power to do something stand by. Responding to abuse with ECT, lack of informed consent and giving this ‘treatment’ involuntary is another violence against women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sue Cunliffe, co-author (Worcester, England)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am a survivor of the misdiagnosis and mistreatment of domestic abuse victims. The very psychiatrists I trusted to rescue me shamed and blamed me, brain damaged me and made me want to die. No amount of ‘happy pills’ or ECT was going to be mind-altering enough to make the abuse I was suffering feel like I was having a fun and happy marriage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Hancock, co-author (San Diego, USA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This survey demonstrates my experience wasn’t as rare an outlier as my doctors, counsellors and mental health staff led me to believe. It is profoundly disorienting to have no frame of reference for daily interactions with family, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances, let alone erasing all education, work experience and cultural cues. Shared memories and life experiences are the foundation of relationships and identity. Erase them and I became a rudderless ship without an anchor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And co-author Dr Lucy Johnstone (Consultant Clinical Psychologist, Bristol, England) adds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘I have had a number of women clients who were prescribed ECT for distress related to rape or domestic abuse. This is not treatment. It is re-traumatisation, and it must stop’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Read said the findings should prompt an urgent re-evaluation of ECT’s use: “Information about sex differences in risk and outcome must be routinely given to women and their families. ECT should not be the default response to women’s suffering.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1763587015804"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why are women receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) more often than men?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Survey data show women are twice as likely to be given ECT, reflecting longstanding biases in psychiatric practice and diagnostic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1763587017533"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What negative effects do women report after receiving ECT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Women report significantly higher rates of long-term memory loss, short-term memory issues, trauma responses, and overall harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1763587017272"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Does ECT benefit women as much as men?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: No. Women are less likely to report improved mood after ECT and far less likely to say they would undergo the treatment again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health and ECT research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a1d1d3c4d2d2e1d4c4cd8fc0c28fd4ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kiera Hay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uel.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of East London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kiera Hay – University of East London&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07399332.2025.2568222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Electroconvulsive therapy and women: An international survey&lt;/a&gt;” by John Read et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health Care For Women International&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electroconvulsive therapy and women: An international survey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;858 electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) recipients, from 44 countries, responded to an online survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In keeping with previous studies, the majority (73%) were women.

The method might one day overcome a key stumbling block faced by gene-editing therapies: the need to design &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01496-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01496-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;a bespoke treatment&lt;/a&gt; for each disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new approach, called PERT, combines &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03797-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03797-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;gene editing&lt;/a&gt; with engineered RNA molecules that allow protein synthesis to continue even when a mutation in the DNA tells it to stop prematurely. Such mutations are called nonsense mutations, and they comprise nearly one-quarter of known disease-causing DNA variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01518-w" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03770-6/d41586-025-03770-6_50982852.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Powerful CRISPR system inserts whole gene into human DNA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, PERT has overcome disease-linked nonsense mutations in mice and in human cells grown in culture, but further testing and refinement are needed before the approach can be studied in people, says David Liu, a chemical biologist at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a co-author of a paper about the technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it does prove effective in humans, PERT could drive down the cost and speed up the development of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03566-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03566-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;gene-editing therapies&lt;/a&gt; for many conditions. “Disease-agnostic approaches like this raise a possibility that, I think, would be incredibly exciting for patients,” says Liu. He and his colleagues published their results on 19 November in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;PERT proposal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu first dreamt up the idea for PERT a few years ago while preparing for an event called science karaoke at his laboratory’s annual retreat. During this event, each member presents an out-of-the-box idea for a project that could send the lab in a new direction. Singing is not required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his project, Liu suggested that the team should investigate synthetic RNA molecules called suppressor tRNAs, which allow a cell’s protein-synthesis machinery to read through a nonsense mutation in the DNA and produce a full-length protein. Suppressor tRNAs, Liu proposed, could be inserted into a genome using &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03566-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03566-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;a technique called prime editing&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of his ten-minute presentation, Liu asked his lab if anyone would be interested in taking on the project; a few members volunteered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03566-8" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03770-6/d41586-025-03770-6_51646824.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Personalized gene editing helped one baby: can it be rolled out widely?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the team worked to develop PERT, other researchers published promising results using suppressor tRNAs without gene editing. One group used a virus to shuttle the tRNA into cells&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; another encased their tRNAs in fatty particles similar to those used in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these approaches showed promise in animal models with genetic diseases. But viruses can provoke dangerous immune responses, and fatty particles required repeated doses, says Zoya Ignatova, a biochemist at the University of Hamburg in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene editing, by contrast, would allow researchers to insert a gene encoding the suppressor tRNA into a recipient’s genome. In theory, no further doses would be needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A new study finds that women’s names filled just 23% of author slots in a sample of nearly 900 retracted articles published in medical journals between 2008 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a really interesting, creative and robust study,” says Curt Rice, who promotes publishing literacy at the Publishing Unlocked project in Oslo, Norway. “The article invites us to dig into issues like negotiations about authorship and the likelihood of scrutiny.” The findings were reported on 19 November in &lt;i&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00509-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03796-w/d41586-025-03796-w_50653532.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Why retractions data could be a powerful tool for cleaning up science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;Study author Paul Sebo, an internal medicine specialist and researcher at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, used an artificial intelligence tool that infers whether authors are male or female based on their first names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He found women’s names in 16.5% of first-author slots and 12.7% of last-author slots for the retracted papers. By contrast, an earlier study that used a similar tool for predicting author gender found that women accounted for 41–45% of first authors and 26–33% of last authors in all articles from the same selection of journals across the same time frame&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risk and reward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpreting the results is fraught. The gender-prediction tools used are imperfect. They do not capture non-binary identities, for example, and can be less accurate with non-Western names than Western ones. But in a manual check of 200 names, Sebo found no mismatches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the findings themselves don’t come with a clear explanation. In an e-mail to &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, Sebo wrote that his suspicion is that the disparity stems from how “women are still underrepresented in senior academic roles, lead fewer projects, and therefore may be less exposed to the kinds of responsibilities (and risks) that are more commonly associated with retractions”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The case for removing fluoride from the drinking water supply just got weaker. Research out today shows no link between water fluoridation and declining cognition in children or adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers examined the education and medical records of a large, nationally representative group of Americans. They found no evidence that water fluoridation was associated with lower test scores in high school or lower cognition scores later in life. The findings seem to undermine one of the most common arguments made against adding fluoride to people’s drinking water, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If fluoride lowers your IQ, then we should see lower test scores in places where they fluoridate the water. And we didn’t, at all,” lead author John Warren, a sociologist and demographer at the University of Minnesota’s Minnesota Population Center, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The fluoride bogeyman&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among some groups, water fluoridation has long been blamed for a range of health problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Longtime antiscience crank Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/03/health/rfk-jr-fluoride-science/index.html"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that fluoride is causing widespread IQ loss and increased bone cancer, for instance. And since taking over as the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services under the second Trump administration, Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/rfk-jr-will-tell-cdc-to-stop-recommending-fluoride-in-drinking-water"&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; that he will tell the CDC to no longer recommend water fluoridation on a national level.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of the most boisterous claims made about fluoride are unsubstantiated by the current data, including a &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/water-fluoridation-and-cancer-risk.html"&gt;supposed cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;. That said, there has been a more &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-does-the-evidence-say-about-fluoride-lowering-iq-2000548298"&gt;substantial scientific debate&lt;/a&gt; over whether water fluoridation can affect children’s IQ. A review published earlier this January and conducted by scientists at the National Institutes of Health &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2828425"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; a possible link between lower IQ levels in children and greater fluoride exposure, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Study researcher John Warren notes, as others &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2828430"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt;, that this review largely focused on studies looking at much higher and potentially toxic levels of fluoride exposure than typically seen in the U.S., however. And in general, there’s only been limited research examining this possible link among American children.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“It really struck me that there was a problem with that meta-analysis,” Warren said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A lack of harm&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Warren and his colleagues believed they had access to data that could provide a clearer picture of the relationship between fluoride and cognition: the &lt;a href="https://edshareproject.org/data/hsb/about"&gt;High School and Beyond&lt;/a&gt; study. This project, initiated in the 1980s, collected reading, math, and vocabulary test scores from over 26,000 high school students across the country; a subset of surviving participants were also contacted as adults and asked to undergo medical evaluations, including tests of their cognition, up through age 60.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Many people grow up in the towns and neighborhoods where they went to high school, especially in the 1980s. So the researchers cross-referenced other federal data on water fluoridation levels in the areas where the children went to school. This data was then used as a proxy for people’s exposure to fluoride as they were growing up. Though many parts of the U.S. had started regularly fluoridating their water by the early 1980s, plenty hadn’t or had adopted their own local standards, allowing the researchers to compare varying levels of fluoride exposure among neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All in all, Warren’s team failed to find a negative association between relatively higher levels of fluoride in a town’s drinking water and high school children’s test scores; if anything, kids in the U.S. exposed to fluoridated water actually seemed to have slightly higher scores on average. This slight advantage faded by age 60, but the researchers still found no link between lower cognition in adults and fluoridated water exposure in childhood. They also found that few neighborhoods exceeded recommended fluoride levels.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“If [fluoride] lowers your IQ, which is supposed to be a permanent change, then you would expect lower cognition at age 60. But we didn’t find that,” Warren said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adz0757"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in Science Advances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The future of fluoridation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Warren notes this study only looked at the relationship between cognition and fluoride, so it alone can’t tell us whether water fluoridation is a net positive. But he points out that other research has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056796.htm"&gt;affirmed&lt;/a&gt; its benefits in improving dental health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers are also aware that children’s test scores are an imperfect indicator of IQ. But they’re now conducting a similar study of children in Wisconsin, where they do have access to IQ test scores.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As is, these findings obviously undercut the rationale to remove fluoride from people’s drinking water. And while the researchers are planning to further study the topic, they argue it will take much stronger evidence than currently amassed to reasonably justify such a removal based on hypothetical concerns about IQ.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we’re showing is that this IQ story—it doesn’t hold up in the United States in a representative sample at levels of fluoride that are actually relevant for policy discussion,” Warren said.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, reason is in short supply these days. Aside from RFK Jr.’s federal campaign, &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/florida-2nd-state-ban-fluoride-public-drinking-water/story?id=121852274#:~:text=MORE:%20Utah%20becomes%201st%20state,last%20month%20to%20ban%20fluoride.&amp;amp;text=Commissioner%20Roberto%20Gonzalez%2C%20who%20sponsored,Control%20and%20Prevention%20(CDC)."&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZJUYFjnnNk"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; have already passed legislation this year to ban water fluoridation, and still more &lt;a href="https://www.wrdw.com/2025/04/22/ga-docs-defend-fluoride-water-critics-seek-removal/"&gt;states and towns&lt;/a&gt; may soon follow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fluoride might not be lowering anyone’s IQ. But the fear of it sure seems to be doing a number on some people’s brains.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

            The longstanding public health practice of adding fluoride to community drinking water is facing heavy scrutiny in the United States over questions about whether the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/03/health/fluoride-drinking-water-tooth-decay-risk-benefit"&gt;benefits outweigh the potential risks&lt;/a&gt;. But new research challenges recent claims about the risks of fluoride in drinking water — and instead suggests that it may have additional positive effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy00043b6n3ku5s58k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The heightened federal debate was spurred by a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/06/health/children-higher-fluoride-levels-lower-iqs-government-study"&gt;recent government study&lt;/a&gt; from the National Toxicology Program that concluded that high levels of fluoride exposure are linked to lower IQ in children, but that study evaluated fluoride exposures that were at least twice the federally recommended limits with notably “&lt;a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/research/assessments/noncancer/completed/fluoride" target="_blank"&gt;insufficient data&lt;/a&gt;” to determine the effects of lower levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy00053b6nyo18qz6c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study looked at more typical, recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water and instead found “robust evidence” that young people exposed to fluoride at these lower levels actually performed better on ​cognitive tests than their peers who did not have fluoride in their drinking water.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Dr. Rob Warren, lead author of the&lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adz0757" target="_blank"&gt; study published in the journal Science Advances&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, said he was “shocked” by the findings from the National Toxicology Program study and motivated to provide research that was more relevant to public policy decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy00073b6nw7uq02rj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I wouldn’t have done this work had it not been an empirical question that I didn’t think we had an answer to, of great immediate policy interest,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy00083b6n42rjak6o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called fluoride “an industrial waste” and cited “IQ loss” in &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1852812012478398923" target="_blank"&gt;pledges&lt;/a&gt; to roll back federal recommendations that fluoride be added to municipal drinking water. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/07/health/utah-fluoride-water-health"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/15/health/florida-fluoride-ban"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; have become the first two states to ban the practice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy00093b6n0iyyxy9w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Imagine testing some new drug for heart disease and the recommended dosage is 100 milligrams, and then your study compares people who get a million milligrams to people who get half a million milligrams. Well, that doesn’t tell you anything about the effect of getting 100 milligrams versus getting nothing,” Warren said. “That’s kind of the world we’re in with fluoride research. It’s important to know that if you get a toxic dose, really bad things happen to your body, but that’s not relevant for the public policy discussion.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000a3b6nx4z11dz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Warren, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota, leads a program that started in the US Department of Education and has followed a cohort of tens of thousands of people for more than four decades since their high school years in the 1980s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000b3b6n382fj10a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the new study, he and other researchers used this data to overlay performance on mathematics, reading and vocabulary tests for a nationally representative sample of nearly 27,000 people with their exposure to fluoride in community drinking water based on historical data from HHS and the US Geological Survey.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000c3b6ndjfrjd54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The analysis assumed that individuals lived near their high school for their whole childhood and grouped them based on whether they would have been consistently exposed to recommended fluoride levels through community water fluoridation or natural occurrence of the mineral, consistently lacking exposure to fluoride, or partly exposed if their community changed their local fluoridation policy at some point during their childhood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000d3b6nj330uxia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Students who were exposed to fluoride for part of their childhood had higher test scores in high school than those who had no exposure to fluoride, and the difference was even greater for those who were exposed to fluoride for their whole childhood, the study found. Follow-up tests continued through 2021, when most participants had reached 60 years of age, and suggested that fluoride exposure also did not contribute to cognitive decline as participants aged.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000e3b6nsoksqobb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cognitive tests are not direct measures of IQ. There is a strong correlation, Warren says, but cognitive tests measure a mix of how well someone’s brain works along with the opportunities they’ve had to learn the material. He’s working on additional research that will directly assess the link between fluoride and IQ, with more precise measurements data about where the individuals lived during childhood, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000f3b6nf6ai9wmv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/30/health/fluoride-removal-excess-cavities-study"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; from this year estimated that removing fluoride from public water in the US would lead to 25.4 million excess decayed teeth in children and adolescents within five years, along with $9.8 billion in health care costs. The new study did not measure individual dental health, but experts say that pain from tooth decay can cause children to have trouble focusing in school or miss it completely — which could be a factor affecting cognitive test scores.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi6am3vi00003b6rapalhitu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fluoride is a mineral that can be found naturally in some foods and groundwater. It can help prevent tooth decay by strengthening the protective outer layer of enamel that can be worn away by acids formed by bacteria, plaque and sugars in the mouth. The practice of adding fluoride to public water systems started in the United States in 1945 to help improve oral health in a cost-effective and equitable way.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000g3b6noot334sv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Dental Association and many experts have continued to support the practice of community water fluoridation, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not changed its recommendations. The agency cannot mandate that communities add fluoride to their water, but it considers 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water to be the “optimal level.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi6ami4r00013b6royh0ivam@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the US Food and Drug Administration recently &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/31/health/fluoride-supplement-restrictions-fda"&gt;took action&lt;/a&gt; to restrict the use of prescription fluoride supplements. “There are better ways to protect children’s teeth than taking unapproved ingestible fluoride, which is now recognized to alter the gut microbiome,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in a news release about the action.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000h3b6ndmzr6c78@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Bruce Lanphear, an epidemiologist and professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, said it’s important to capture a more complete set of all sources of fluoride exposures, such as toothpaste and pesticides.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000i3b6niaguwh3q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Population strategies – like fluoridation, like vaccination, like taking lead out of gasoline – they can be extraordinarily powerful. If you’ve got a safe and effective intervention, you can have a big impact on the health of populations,” he said. “But when you have a population strategy like fluoridation, the evidence about its safety and about its effectiveness has to be extraordinarily strong.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000j3b6nmt4unwfe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in a &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aed4503" target="_blank"&gt;formal response&lt;/a&gt; to the new research that was also published in Science Advances on Wednesday, Dr. David Savitz, an epidemiologist with the Brown University School of Public Health, argues that the greater burden lies on proving the risk before ending a public health practice that has been successful for decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000k3b6ndkl9lppx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Until clear evidence exists that water fluoridation lacks public health benefit or compelling evidence of harm at the level of fluoride exposure in fluoridated water, neither of which has occurred, it seems foolhardy to interfere with a long-established and well-recognized public health success,” he wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000l3b6nhr53fqlx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With due credit to the folk wisdom of Bert Lance, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Jimmy Carter, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’ Warren and colleagues move the needle a bit further into the ‘ain’t broke’ range.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fiber’s benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/the-protein-problem/index.html"&gt;muscle-building protein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, fiber isn’t sexy. It’s &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ultraprocessed-foods-markers-biomarkers-3d19f93573cf36698c7b946fee6e8d18"&gt;a carbohydrate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; found in plants that your body can’t break down. It helps feed gut bacteria and move food through the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Folks don’t want to talk about it at a dinner party,” said Debbie Petitpain, a registered dietitian nutritionist and a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of fiber. Soluble fiber dissolves in water and forms a gel-like material that feeds gut bacteria. It’s found in foods like oats, peas, beans, apples and carrots. Insoluble fiber doesn’t dissolve in water and moves food through the digestive system. It’s found in whole wheat flour, popcorn, wheat bran, nuts, green beans and potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.

    &lt;div class="Infobox-items RichTextBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/be-well"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more Be Well.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that fiber lowers cholesterol levels, regulates blood sugar and promotes weight loss, since high-fiber foods tend to make eaters feel more full. It may also protect against heart disease, diabetes, diverticulitis and colon cancer, according to the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Petitpain said rising use of GLP-1 weight loss drugs could be one reason for the renewed focus on fiber, since GLP-1s naturally slow digestion and fiber can prevent constipation. She said fiber has seen similar spikes in interest when people wanted to alleviate symptoms from high-fat diets like Atkins or keto.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;How much fiber do we need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people in Western countries could use more fiber because their diets are low in vegetables, fruits and whole grains, said Sander Kersten, director of the Division of Nutritional Sciences at Cornell University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s guidelines, adults should aim for 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories they consume. That’s about 25 grams of fiber for women and 38 grams for men each day. Petitpain said Americans generally only get about two-thirds of that amount.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;For reference, 1 cup of raspberries contains 8 grams of fiber, while a banana contains 3.2 grams, according to the USDA. One-half cup of avocado contains 5 grams of fiber and 1 cup of lima beans contains 13.2 grams. Fiber One, a bran cereal, packs 18 grams of fiber into a 2/3-cup serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are good ways to increase fiber?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kersten said long-term studies about the benefits of fiber have looked at the consumption of whole foods and not &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2024/ultraprocessed-foods-are-everywhere-how-bad-are-they/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;packaged products&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with added fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way it is consumed as an additive and part of a diet that doesn’t contain a lot of fiber may be different than a naturally fiber-rich diet,” Kersten said. “You can eat a very processed, Western diet and consume foods that are enriched, but we don’t know if it confers the same benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole foods also help the body in other ways, Petitpain said. An apple contains 4.8 grams of fiber as well as water, vitamins and minerals, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some recommendations from the Mayo Clinic for adding fiber to your diet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Choose a breakfast cereal with 5 grams or more of fiber a serving. Top it with a sliced banana or berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Choose breads with at least 2 grams of fiber per serving and try other grains like brown rice, whole-wheat pasta and quinoa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— When baking, substitute whole-grain flour for white flour. Add wheat bran to muffins and cookies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Try to eat five or more servings of fruit and vegetables daily. If you eat canned fruit, make sure it’s canned in fruit juice and not syrup, and make sure canned vegetables are low in sodium.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Think twice about fibermaxxing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no defined upper limit for fiber intake, Kersten said. But increasing fiber can cause painful gas and bloating, especially if it’s done quicky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petitpain said people should increase their fiber intake gradually and drink plenty of water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re feeding gut bacteria a food, and you can’t break it down. You rely on them, and if you give them second, third and fourth servings, there’s not enough of them to handle the extra load,” Petitpain said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain populations should also be extra careful about their fiber intake, Petitpain said. People who are sensitive to gluten or allergic to foods like soy, shellfish or psyllium husk should read labels carefully since some foods with added fiber contain those ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, Kersten questions the trend of focusing on one nutrient, whether it’s protein or fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t need nutrients, we need foods. Ultimately, what you want to be striving for is a healthy diet, and you should choose foods that are considered to be an important part of a healthy diet,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="33" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69nzmy00183b79jxunhd9p@published"&gt;I’m a 59-year-old gay man who had a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/prostatectomy/about/pac-20385198"&gt;prostatectomy&lt;/a&gt; last year. I often receive aggressive, in-person flirtation from nice guys who obviously want to hook up casually. I owe them a warning, though.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69usp6002p3b794seao9jb@published"&gt;I desperately want to say yes (with precautions), but when do I tell them that I won’t get hard? I’m a passionate guy who enjoys a lot of things, and can still have wild, dry orgasms. Rejecting a blowjob comes off as rejecting the person. Mentioning my prostate cancer is a mood killer for a casual flirtation, but guys take it personally if we make out and I don’t get hard (even though I’m totally into it). I have a BiMix prescription, but even then, it’s not very portable, and I have to excuse myself awkwardly. What explanation do I owe them, and when? If it’s a dealbreaker, I’m wasting their time. Nobody seems to understand the sad side effects of this surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="7" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69nzu1001a3b79p9v07hqw@published"&gt;—From Top to Bottom But Still Alive&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69nzz4001c3b79d1cvklos@published"&gt;I feel for you and agree—the effects of a prostatectomy are not discussed very often in mainstream forums. Especially lacking is how they impact gay sex. It sounds like you’re handling yours well, though. I don’t know for sure if your sign-off is a true reflection of how you’ve modified your sexual practices to your current abilities/interests, but if so: Bravo. You’re finding your way despite unfair limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="163" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69o02j001d3b79au1uvheh@published"&gt;If you are identifying as a bottom, it is completely reasonable to say upfront to potential partners that your dick is off limits, especially in casual encounters. Plenty of bottoms don’t get hard and/or put no focus on their penises during sex. This may disappoint some vers/top guys, but it won’t turn them all off. The negative reactions you’ve received about your lack of erection won’t necessarily be the norm—you may just have encountered a less-than-ideal sample. You’re nearly 60 years old, and it’s not uncommon for guys to have erectile issues as they get older. You don’t have to explain yourself or talk about your surgery. They can take it or leave it. This may result in rejection, but so might identifying as a total top in the event that one encounters another total top. It’s OK to not be for everyone, as exciting as it is to be pursued on a mass scale. Let people take their disappointment and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69o05u001e3b79p4vz3trx@published"&gt;So for hookups, I’d say you owe little to no explanation. You’re doing what you’re doing, it doesn’t involve your dick being hard, and that is that. If you were to embark on regular sex with someone, whether a sex bud or a boyfriend, that’s when you might want to say something. You’d want to do it sometime around when you notice things getting less anonymous. At that point, your partner will have already liked what you’ve offered so far, and hopefully, will be happy just keeping things as they are.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69o0bx001f3b79rhxkev2t@published"&gt;Familiarity might make the BiMix injection process a bit less awkward, too. Regarding that medication, it’s worth trying to break down the awkwardness you feel about that. It’s not ideal, but look at how amazing medical technology is! If someone really wants to play with your hard dick, there is a good chance that he will be accepting of whatever method you use to achieve it. Having to use drugs to achieve and maintain an erection can be humbling, but if you try to focus on the practicality, it may make it easier. It’s nothing to be ashamed of.&lt;/p&gt;

I have tried to have many conversations about sex and they are hardly productive. I have tried many of the common suggestions for improving sexual frequency, having a set day/time for it, asking her what I can do to turn her on, etc. But every suggestion is brushed off, she wants our sex life to be spontaneous, or she just has to be in the right mood to do it, and while I respect her answers to these questions they don’t help me figure out what I can do to help. Over the past year, I know she has made an effort to increase frequency for me, and I GREATLY appreciate it. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/10/wife-requests-sex-advice.html"&gt;However, there is a hitch.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shortage of human &lt;strong&gt;organs for transplants &lt;/strong&gt;has long been a pressing issue in the medical field, with thousands of patients waiting for lifesaving treatments. However, a recent breakthrough might offer a solution: genetically modified pig organs. Published November 13 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, a pioneering study has shown that it is possible to prevent human rejection of a pig organ, a remarkable first in the field of xenotransplantation. This study could revolutionize the future of organ donation and transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have been exploring the potential of using &lt;strong&gt;pig organs in human transplants &lt;/strong&gt;as a solution to the ever-growing demand for organ donations. However, the body’s immune system has consistently rejected these foreign organs, making it a near-impossible solution. In a groundbreaking experiment led by &lt;strong&gt;Robert Montgomery at NYU Langone&lt;/strong&gt;, researchers successfully reversed the rejection of a pig kidney in a human subject not once, but twice, marking a historic step forward in xenotransplantation. “It’s a huge step forward,” Montgomery explains, emphasizing that this breakthrough could lead to the use of gene-edited pig organs as a viable alternative to human organs in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The experiment, which took place &lt;strong&gt;over 61 days&lt;/strong&gt;, was performed on a brain-dead patient who was used as a model for the study. During this time, the transplanted kidney was rejected twice, but both instances were reversed using existing medications. This not only showcased the possibility of maintaining organ function, but also revealed the complexity of the body’s immune response to animal organs. Researchers were able to track these immune reactions in unprecedented detail, allowing them to adjust treatments to combat the rejection, an essential development for future &lt;strong&gt;xenotransplantation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Montgomery further adds,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “We could really get a very dense set of data points from doing biopsies, taking blood samples, body fluid samples and create an atlas of what that immune response looks like.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt; The ability to track and intervene so precisely provides an invaluable foundation for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Understanding Xenotransplantation: A New Hope for Organ Shortages&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xenotransplantation&lt;/strong&gt;—the transplantation of animal organs into humans—has always been a controversial and challenging field. However, with increasing advancements in genetic engineering, scientists are beginning to believe that the long-held dream of using pig organs as a reliable substitute for human ones may finally be within reach. The pigs used in these experiments are genetically modified to make their organs more compatible with human physiology, reducing the likelihood of immediate rejection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking study, as detailed in the November 13&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/363501a0.epdf?sharing_token=fXa1zzypoUkEDhQy0NFkENRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MIT85q_BBLNftXSluJVj2bdf_cHiAkoNWMBjs1ajnIPUbCS8Z9axzYtdXk4Fx82Zy-W2-N48QV28Yveo5urolsUZml5igBGIXk1CUUsQxnhfohJDUx4gUb34WDLmKG-wapLHz37sKJ9OlNr-0qOWM7LhiJIk2fhv-Htt1b1iVmGA%3D%3D&amp;amp;tracking_referrer=www.newscientist.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; publication&lt;/a&gt;, marks a significant milestone. The transplant team observed the patient’s immune response closely, identifying the specific T cells and antibodies involved in the rejection process. These findings are vital for improving the survival of xenotransplanted organs in human bodies. The research also sheds light on the molecular mechanisms that drive these rejections, allowing scientists to intervene and prevent them more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sixty-one days of stable renal function is novel proof of concept,” says Minnie Sarwal, a transplant surgeon from UCSF. She praises the study’s findings, emphasizing the durability of the genetically engineered pig kidney. &lt;strong&gt;The 61-day period &lt;/strong&gt;of stable &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/3d-printed-materials-enhance-organ-battery/" data-type="post" data-id="95923"&gt;organ &lt;/a&gt;function provides concrete evidence that pig organs can sustain life in humans, offering a beacon of hope for patients who may otherwise face lengthy waits for human organ transplants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Path Forward: Clinical Trials and Future Applications&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the study was conducted on a single patient, the results are being hailed as a major step forward in the field of organ transplantation. Following this success, Montgomery’s team plans to test their immune suppression techniques in 20 additional patients to see if these results can be replicated. The hope is that the findings will not only improve the functionality of pig organs but also pave the way for their widespread use in human transplant surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Montgomery is optimistic about the future, stating, “As we move forward, I do believe that we will be in a position in the next few years where gene-edited pig organs will be an alternative to human organs.” This statement highlights the transformative potential of xenotransplantation, which could significantly reduce the number of patients waiting for life-saving transplants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the ability to reverse rejection could lead to more stable and long-lasting transplants, making pig organs a viable option for patients in dire need of replacements. The implications of this research extend beyond just kidneys and livers, with scientists eyeing other organs, such as hearts and lungs, for potential transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ethical Considerations and the Future of Animal Organs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the potential benefits of xenotransplantation are clear, there are still many ethical considerations to address. Concerns about animal welfare, genetic modification, and the long-term effects of animal-human organ transplants need careful thought and regulation. These ethical questions will play a crucial role in shaping the future of xenotransplantation, as society grapples with the idea of using genetically altered animals as sources of organ donation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, with the success of the recent study, the conversation surrounding xenotransplantation is shifting from skepticism to cautious optimism. If these techniques can be refined and scaled, they could drastically reduce the number of deaths due to organ shortages. The results of this study provide a glimpse into a future where genetically engineered animal organs could save lives—if not tomorrow, then in the very near future.&lt;/p&gt;

But &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2026-89350-001.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; from the American Psychological Association now directly ties short form video content with significantly diminished mental health. In short — pun intended — it’s rotting brains.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Previous studies have focused mainly on TikTok, which has limited the generalizability of findings across platforms. Since short form video content is now ubiquitous across social media (even LinkedIn is getting in on it, if any further proof of its spread is needed), so limiting studies to just one platform doesn’t paint a clear picture. Therefore, this study includes data from 98,299 participants across 71 studies and examines short form video’s effects on viewers beyond the progenitor platform. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study examines engagement and attempted to find more nuanced insights than in previous studies and even assesses cognitive and mental health indices to identify specific health domains associated with short form video ingestion. The study also looks at age and offers findings into the differences of how this type of content affects youths and adults. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings are definitive. The study saw that heavy short form video consumption is directly associated with diminished cognitive functions, particularly a person’s ability to pay attention and control their inhibitions. In both younger and older age groups, higher ingestion of short form video (SFV) content is died to poorer attention spans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To understand some of how these findings occur, the researchers reference the “dual theory of habituation and sensitization” from Groves and Thompsons’s study from 1970 called &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0029810" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Habituation: A dual-process theory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“According to this framework, repeated exposure to highly stimulating, fast-paced content may contribute to habituation, in which users become desensitized to slower, more effortful cognitive tasks such as reading, problem solving, or deep learning,” the study reads. “This process may gradually reduce cognitive endurance and weaken the brain’s ability to sustain attention on a single task. Simultaneously, SFV platforms may promote sensitization by providing immediate, algorithmically curated rewards, potentially reinforcing impulsive engagement patterns and encouraging habitual seeking of instant gratification.”&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt; &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt; &lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Bingeing TikTok reels may be hazardous to your well-being.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;71 studies, &amp;gt;98k people: The more short-form videos teens and adults watched, the more they struggled with attention, self-control, and stress and anxiety. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read a book. Watch a movie. Long live longform. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Yzyv68kBDh" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Yzyv68kBDh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Adam Grant (@AdamMGrant) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AdamMGrant/status/1989360583796572636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener"&gt;November 14, 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;p&gt;This type of content — specifically how it is delivered — stimulates the brain’s reward system, reinforcing habitual use. The study suggests that “excessive” SFV consumption can lead to social isolation, lower life satisfaction, and even self-esteem and body image (the researchers do admit that more research is required on that last note). Increased use of these platforms is also tied to poorer sleep, increased anxiety, and loneliness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are all side effects that are also associated with physically addictive substances, which highlights the study’s findings that SFV content is addictive and damaging. On that note, the study created a scale to measure addiction to SFV content that can be used in future studies on this topic. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Overall, these findings highlight the importance of understanding the broader health implications of SFV use, given its pervasive role in daily life and potential to impact health, behavior, and well-being. By synthesizing current evidence, this study provides a critical foundation for future research to explore understudied health domains (e.g., cognitive health, physical health) and offers insights to guide public discourse and the development of research-informed approaches for promoting more balanced engagement with SFVs,” the researchers say. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In summary, SFV content is reducing attention spans and the ability for users to critically think, quite literally contributing to “brain rot,” &lt;a href="https://modernity.news/2025/11/17/tiktok-zombie-brain-rot-confirmed-by-major-study/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Modernity News&lt;/em&gt; puts it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The full study can be &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2026-89350-001.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener"&gt;downloaded from apa.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They’re &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/high-protein-breakfasts-you-can-make-when-youre-still-half-asleep"&gt;quick to to cook&lt;/a&gt; and easy to eat. And each one packs about 6 grams of protein. But there are a lot of other high-protein snacks out there—both in the meat and veggie categories— that offer significantly more protein while being just as easy to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aren’t just talking steaks or &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/high-protein-meals-easy"&gt;lean chicken breasts&lt;/a&gt;, but a variety of plant and animal proteins that you can snack on or add to meals. Best of all, by broadening your protein intake away from eggs and meat alone, you’ll pack in a whole roster of other benefits for your gut, brain, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Icelandic dried fish to clever whole-food pairings, these non-eggy options will help you meet your fitness goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meat and fish options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gullfiskur Harfiskur (Icelandic Dried Fish)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With 80g protein per 100g, this is lean, briny, and pure,” says David Higgins, the author of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hollywood Body Plan,&lt;/em&gt; and co-founder of lifestyle performance club &lt;a data-offer-url="https://body-space.co.uk" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://body-space.co.uk"}' href="https://body-space.co.uk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bodyspace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This traditional Icelandic snack is quite literally just dried white fish—no frills, no &lt;a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/carb-cycling-diet" target="_blank"&gt;carbs&lt;/a&gt;, and more protein than almost any food on the planet. “I first discovered it while working in Iceland and it’s now a non-negotiable travel snack,” says Higgins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat it with a smear of hummus or a grain-based cracker for a smart balance of texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biltong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of biltong as jerky’s more sophisticated cousin. It’s air-dried, richly seasoned beef that’s protein-dense and packed with umami. “My go-to? The Biltong Factory. Their classic cut is clean, chewy, and easy to portion out,” says Higgins, who points to biltong’s whopping 50g of protein per 100g. “Add a handful of roasted chickpeas or lentil crackers for a complete amino chain,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vegetarian options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seitan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re not gluten-intolerant, seitan is a real powerhouse with up to 25g of protein per 100g,” says physical trainer and nutritionist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://pennyweston.com/about-me/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://pennyweston.com/about-me/"}' href="https://pennyweston.com/about-me/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Penny Weston&lt;/a&gt;. Often used as a meat alternative by &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/the-new-veganism"&gt;vegans&lt;/a&gt;, seitan is well known for its texture and it’s ability to absorb flavors, making it a decent addition to curries, stews, stir-frys and other dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edamame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These young soybeans pack a serious protein punch,” says Sas Parsad, nutritionist and founder of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://thegutco.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoovuuNTAaAtVRQyx3A1CdWpeFpN3dX_z_MrnvdQtXi790DCkADQ" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://thegutco.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoovuuNTAaAtVRQyx3A1CdWpeFpN3dX_z_MrnvdQtXi790DCkADQ"}' href="https://thegutco.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoovuuNTAaAtVRQyx3A1CdWpeFpN3dX_z_MrnvdQtXi790DCkADQ" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Gut Co&lt;/a&gt;.
