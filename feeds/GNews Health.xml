"We encourage people who were possibly exposed to take action if they are not protected against measles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Health Department is encouraging people who were exposed to check their vaccination status and watch for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when infected people cough, sneeze, or talk. People who aren't protected against measles can get the virus up to two hours after someone else with measles left the same room or airspace, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The early symptoms of measles are fever, runny nose, cough, and red, puffy eyes, followed by rash. In some people, it can be a very serious infection that leads to pneumonia, brain infection, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Many countries, including travel destinations, are experiencing measles outbreaks, so the potential for travel-related measles cases and subsequent outbreaks in the United States has increased. We strongly encourage parents to follow the CDC's immunization schedule and get their children fully vaccinated as soon as they are able. People planning to travel outside the United States should speak with their doctor about their travel plans and vaccinations needed," Raval-Nelson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The MMR vaccine is safe and highly effective and is the best way to avoid serious complications of a vaccine-preventable disease, city health officials say.

Public health guidelines shifted and in &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/12250/New-guidelines-detail-use-of-infant-safe-peanut-to?autologincheck=redirected" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; the Prevention of Peanut Allergy Guidelines recommended introducing peanut protein to infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“A common misconception about food allergies is that delaying the introduction of allergenic foods may help prevent them,” says Dr Stanislaw Gabryszewski, an attending physician at the Children’s hospital of Philadelphia and one of the paper’s co-authors. “We now have strong evidence showing the opposite – that introducing peanuts and other common allergens early in infancy can actually reduce the risk of developing an anaphylactic food allergy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So how do allergies work? And how can parents cautiously introduce their children to food allergens like peanuts? We asked experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-food-allergies" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What are food allergies?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“When someone has a food allergy, their body makes antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE), directed against the food allergen,” explains Dr Hemant Sharma, the chief of allergy and immunology at Children’s National hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a479d0da-520d-465e-9640-446edfeee56c" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":8,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Soy, oat, almond, rice: which alternative milk is healthiest?","elementId":"a479d0da-520d-465e-9640-446edfeee56c","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/nov/04/milk-alternatives-best-health-comparison-oat-soy-almond-rice"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Put another way: the body mistakenly identifies the food as something harmful and produces protective proteins (IgE), which bind to the food allergen and try to flush it out of the body. This results in &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9196-food-allergies" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as hives; itchy skin; swelling of the face, lips or mouth; vomiting; diarrhea; difficulty swallowing and shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Food allergies are the result of “a complex combination of genetic and environmental factors”, says Gabryszewski. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/allergies" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Allergies&lt;/a&gt; can run in families, but there can also be external influences, he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The most common food allergies in children are milk, eggs and peanuts, Gabryszewski. “Most children tend to outgrow their milk and egg allergies, but peanut allergy tends to persist,” he says. In adults, some of the most common food allergies are peanuts, tree nuts and shellfish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-common-are-peanut-allergies" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How common are peanut allergies?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Before the 1990s, peanut allergies were rare. While they are still not hugely common, numbers doubled in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Children with eczema and egg allergies are at a higher risk of developing a peanut allergy and the guidelines suggest parents of higher-risk children may want to speak to a specialist first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There are no exact guidelines about the amount and regularity of exposure. “An age-appropriate amount introduced ‘early and often’ is generally recommended,” says Sharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To prevent choking, experts say babies should be able to control their head and neck, and swallow food rather than let it dribble on to their chin before they try to eat &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infant-toddler-nutrition/foods-and-drinks/when-what-and-how-to-introduce-solid-foods.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;any solid food&lt;/a&gt;. Even then, whole peanuts are a choking hazard for babies, and peanut butter can be difficult for them to swallow. Gabryszewski suggests thinning peanut butter in water or breast milk, “working towards about 2 tsp a few times a week”. McNairn also recommends Bamba peanut butter puffs, puffed peanut snacks that dissolve in the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While introducing any allergen to a child, McNairn says guardians should watch closely for signs of an allergic reaction, such as hives or vomiting. Mild symptoms including a rash or hives can usually be treated with an antihistamine, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.chla.org/blog/advice-experts/babies-and-food-allergies" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Children’s hospital of Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. But if the child is vomiting, coughing or having difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately, either by getting a doctor on the phone or going to an emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d9856b1a-46cc-4ec4-8b33-fafd4071df4b" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":23,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Beans, beans, the magical fruit: how healthy are they really?","elementId":"d9856b1a-46cc-4ec4-8b33-fafd4071df4b","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/nov/06/beans-healthy-food"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If after several exposures to the food, the child has no negative reaction, they can probably tolerate it. It is also important to continue exposing them to the food, McNairn says. If a baby is exposed to a food and seems to tolerate it, but then that food is removed from the diet, “they could become sensitized to it,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For this reason, McNairn recommends parents prioritize introducing their children to food that they regularly eat and have in the home. “If you’re eating communally at a dinner table, the baby’s going to want to eat what you’re eating,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Gabryszewski notes that early introduction does not necessarily prevent a food allergy. More research is needed on both prevention and treatment of these allergies, he says, but he is still optimistic about his recent study’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is a heartening indication that our growing emphasis on early introduction has been accompanied by a reduction in peanut allergy,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 18:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPQlhLUEJwWFo4ZnlzbnJwNW5WMjlyZURnMDhGU2lfRUlfM3U2V0J0Qm15SVZjNjgxOFBlUElzS2x4M0JSZFR3dnMwa0NhenFLc0RzZGU1VjNZRmtvTVNqekxoVEJRN0UxQVJQcm9INXd2OWVLY1owb3VFSW5qYU4zWlNYV2dJbS1jb1A4dXJUb0VfcTFyOHVDbWxR</guid></item><item><title>当我爸爸得了癌症时，我一直在问， '为什么是他？ “他的三字回答让我失望。- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/dad-got-cancer-kept-asking-134414732.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The author and her father at a wedding in summer 2014, three months after he was diagnosed with colon cancer.

When she first pulled the pan from the oven, a thick layer of oil wriggled at the top. My brother, father and I playfully jabbed at it with our fingers, giggling as Mom rolled her eyes and scraped the oil off into the trash before dropping it on the table with an annoyed thump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Read: &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/veterans-against-trump-brain-psychology_n_6908dbcce4b0c4a0f50a03c3?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I Saw A Cop Looking At My ‘Veterans Against Trump’ T-Shirt.

Then He Started Walking My Way.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As dinner started and we filled our plates, we traded glances with one another and begrudgingly took scoops of the potatoes, lifting small bites to our mouths with reservation to make Mom happy. But as we ate, Dad sat back in discomfort, lips pressed, looking down at the food he’d hardly touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been signs prior ― indigestion and aches in his abdomen. That January, we had taken a family trip to Mexico, and most days he’d return to the room early to lie down. At the buffets, he’d turn up his nose, nauseated. For months his appetite would wane and he’d feel uncomfortable, but we figured it was because it was flu season, or he was traveling or something was wrong with the food. So maybe those awful potatoes were upsetting him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One month after Easter, my dad was diagnosed with colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the year that followed, Dad stepped into his treatment with hope and resolve. He’d crack jokes with the staff that administered his chemo, forgot about the port in his chest and would walk talkative laps with us in the hospital ward when he needed stents in his kidneys. But over time, the disease gathered strength and pulled more from him. He lost weight, lost hair and, eventually, he lost faith that he would beat the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Read: &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sold-house-family-life-on-the-road-rv_n_68e537bce4b038265cc822bc?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:We Sold Our House For A Life On The Road.

It’s Changed Our Family In The Most Beautiful Ways.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day he was diagnosed, I had flown home from Chicago and entered into a silent pact with myself. I would never break in front of him. I wouldn’t let my fear and anger become a burden and give him more to bear. On the way home, I hid in a dirty bathroom stall, sobbing gently so no one would hear me. I nodded politely at airline attendants and hid my puffy eyes behind sunglasses. I collapsed into my mother’s arms upon arrival ― breathless, afraid my legs would give out ― and cried all the way to the hospital in an effort to exorcise my feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when we went inside and I saw Dad for the first time, I gave myself no choice but to temper the anxious fluttering in my chest. For the next year, I took solace in the shadowed corners of hospital hallways when he’d return there, symptoms flaring, but would go back to his room with a smile on my face. At home, I’d retreat to the bathroom to soothe the red gathering in my eyes or release my rage by throwing things in the basement. Then, once I’d pulled myself together, I’d sit beside him to swap jokes and tell favorite old stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The author visiting her father at work. &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Courtesy of Erin Hall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was 10 months into his treatment when I finally broke in front of him, and he revealed the surprising yet profound truth he was using to guide his way through his diagnosis. It was a warm spring afternoon, and I sat across from Dad in the living room where the sun poured in. Our conversation moved from everyday chatter to the latest news about his treatments, his progress, the food he could still stomach and what might be next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I approached all of it ― no matter how bleak ― with optimism. I looked for a kernel of hope even where there appeared to be none. But Dad thwarted me with his steadfast practicality and the reality I couldn’t avoid. “I’m sick, dear,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Read: &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/daughter-diagnosed-neuromyelitis-optica-grief_n_68c4432fe4b0bf6c8bff4463?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:When My Daughter Received A Life-Altering Diagnosis, I Heard The Same Phrase Over And Over.

Why him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He looked back at me calmly and then said something I’ll never forget: “Why not me?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why not me. &lt;/em&gt;Three little words leveled the room and then hung there definitively, filling the space between us like a fog. Even in the thick of his suffering, he could so clearly see and accept what most people never do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why my father? Why my friend? Why my spouse? Why my child?

To place blame. But Dad didn’t do anything to get cancer ― it just happened. This realization meant accepting the absolute absence of reason. Cancer ― and other terrible, unthinkable things ― doesn’t happen to everyone but can, in fact, happen to &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2015, just shy of one year after Dad was diagnosed, we lost him to colon cancer. My grief has lingered since then like a mild, disorienting fever I carry every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these last seven years, I’ve watched colon cancer gather strength. I’ve seen more headlines about how it’s upended more lives. I’ve read more disheartening facts about how more people are battling it or losing their lives to it. March is Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, and I can’t help but look back on those three words and how they offer invaluable wisdom ― and a way to put Dad’s perspective into practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the&lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/CRCFactsFigures2023" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;, colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer deaths. It’s estimated that there will be more than 150,000 new cases of colorectal cancer in the U.S. this year, and though it’s long been thought of as a disease that typically affects older people, it’s becoming&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/colon-cancer-advanced-younger-symptoms-rcna72983" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more prevalent in people under 55;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; more prevalent in people under 55&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The author (right) with her family at a wedding four months after her father’s colon cancer diagnosis. &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Courtesy of Erin Hall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though we might not have a reason for why someone gets colon cancer, we do have ways to detect it, and the earlier we do, the better the prognosis usually is. In fact, the&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/detection.html#:~:text=One%20reason%20for%20this%20is,survival%20rate%20is%20about%2090%25." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society notes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; American Cancer Society notes&lt;/a&gt; that “when colorectal cancer is found at an early stage before it has spread, the 5-year relative survival rate is about 90%.”&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/acs-recommendations.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Getting screened for colon cancer starting at 45;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; Getting screened for colon cancer starting at 45&lt;/a&gt; is important for people with an average risk of the disease, and those with a family history of the disease (which up to &lt;a href="https://fightcolorectalcancer.org/about-colorectal-cancer/general-information/facts-stats/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:30%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;30%&lt;/a&gt; of colorectal cancer patients have) or&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/acs-recommendations.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:other risk factors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; other risk factors&lt;/a&gt; may want to talk to their doctor about beginning screenings even earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, according to the Fight Colorectal Cancer organization, more than&lt;a href="https://fightcolorectalcancer.org/about-colorectal-cancer/general-information/facts-stats/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:20 million;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; 20 million&lt;/a&gt; Americans are behind on their screenings, even though diagnoses are becoming increasingly&lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/CRCFactsFigures2023" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more advanced;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; more advanced&lt;/a&gt;.

I take constant inventory of my health, and I hope my family’s story may motivate others to do the same. I can’t say that things would have turned out differently if Dad had been screened or had seen a doctor earlier about his symptoms, but the not knowing ― the chance that he might have been saved ― is a question that will claw inside of me for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, Dad’s realization ― “Why not me?” ― wasn’t just about his sickness, and it has taught me more than just to prioritize my health. It has also inspired me to live a fuller life. Chance invites risk, but it also invites reward. Dad reminded me to be careful when I can and where I should, but also to believe in myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because of this, I’ve discovered I can take impassioned leaps and land somewhere I never thought possible. Whether it’s pursuing my love of writing or moving to new places, it’s helpful to remember that we don’t know what great things can happen unless we try. Dad’s words have helped me experience incredible moments and do things that I may not have otherwise done because... why not me? Why shouldn’t I reach for all of the things I want? Why shouldn’t I pursue all the things Dad would want for me ― and that he would be so happy to see me achieve if he were here? Maybe those three words were his final guiding lesson, and it’s one that has given me the strength to live a life he would be proud of. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This essay was originally published in March 2023 and is being featured again as part of HuffPost Personal’s “Best Of” series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Erin Hall is a proud Michigander currently residing in Chicago.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhurwi9v000o3b798120ktkc@published"&gt;I’m a 28-year-old woman in a relationship with a 31-year-old man. We’ve been together for a year. Our sex life is really positive, but we definitely have a sex drive mismatch, which involves him wanting more and kinkier sex. This isn’t a bad thing; I don’t feel pressured in any way, and we have healthy and open communication about it. I’m also up for most of his kinks. However, he has expressed a strong desire for something new.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhurwicj000p3b79ick8s2eb@published"&gt;He wants to be pegged. He has done it in the past, and would ideally have it be a recurring event in our sex life. I feel bad saying this, but the idea is a major turn-off for me, and I know if we did explore that, I would think less of him. Am I being mean? Is there a way to explore this and try to be positive about it? I just don’t know how to approach this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhurwijz000s3b79wqomaa2j@published"&gt;You wrote that you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; you would &lt;em&gt;think less of him&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re certain, or even fairly certain, that you will lose a significant amount of attraction or respect for your partner if you proceed with a particular sex act, the situation is more high-risk for the relationship than a turn-off or a lack of interest would be. “Mean” here would look like using language of shame and judgment when talking to him about it: ”Ew, gross, I’ll never see you as a man again.” Another inappropriate action would be making a unilateral decision to follow through on something you really don’t want and that has the power to destroy the connection between the two of you. Give your partner the opportunity to consider, for himself, whether his desire to be pegged by you is more important than the potential damage to what you have together.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="135" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhurwilr000t3b79r48t63j4@published"&gt;Before you open that conversation, do your best to understand which facets of your regard for your partner would likely decrease, and why. Where are those fears coming from? Have you been in similar situations previously? Are there maybe areas where you’re making assumptions about yourself, your partner, or the act of pegging itself? Are you holding on to some harmful beliefs about what makes someone “man enough”? Are there parts of what you imagine pegging to be like that are the issue, and which might not be required for your partner’s enjoyment? Lastly, do some real soul-searching around whether the fact that he wants to be pegged at all is already giving you significant ick—if so, there’s no need to put yourself or him through the process of negotiation and giving it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

For instance, if you’re concerned about encountering feces (while there’s no way to achieve a completely sanitized rectum and no total guarantee of a poop-free pegging), your partner probably has some experience with cleaning himself out in preparation. If you’re assuming there needs to be a dynamic of submission on his part or of humiliation, ask whether those are part of his preferences. Whatever the turn-offs are, get more information.&lt;/p&gt;

If you can name what you’re afraid you’ll lose in terms of how you see him, in a kind way, go ahead and state that. Otherwise, stick to the statement that pegging is very much not for you and is a hard limit.&lt;/p&gt;

We were friends for a long time but moved into more of a sexual relationship about a year ago when we found ourselves single at the same time. He’s intelligent and educated, and best of all, he makes me laugh. There’s no money differential; we’re both blessed with good white-collar jobs. Due to long-standing health issues, he’s unable to get or maintain an erection, but I feel like he’s great in bed and I tell him so all the time! &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/07/age-gap-older-man-sex-advice.html"&gt;However, he’s planning surgery for a penile implant soon…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That is 10 to 15 percent above the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Scientists have found a shocking link between alga blooms and Alzheimer's (Stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Algae blooms contain microscopic organisms that release compounds, which are highly toxic to nerve cells, damaging the brain regions responsible for memory, thinking and communication (Pictured: An algae bloom from above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Maps of algal bloom occurrences and Alzheimer's prevalence overlap in concerning ways,' Davis said. 'We're really worried about people in Florida being exposed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Florida has been tracking harmful algal blooms since 1844, but climate change, warmer waters, fertilizer runoff and stagnant canals are fueling 'super-blooms' that can persist for months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the blooms may look harmless, appearing as a bright green, blue-green or brown-red paint spilled on the water, they produce dangerous toxins, including β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate study in Guam showed that BMAA produced by cyanobacteria entered the local food chain through fruit bats that ate toxic cycad seeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Villagers then consumed the bats, ingesting high doses of the toxin. Many developed a rare neurological disorder unique to the island known as ALS-PDC (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Parkinsonism-Dementia Complex), which combines symptoms of ALS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Paul Allen Cox, co-author of the Guam study, spent more than two decades researching cyanobacterial toxins and their effects on human health. His findings initially sparked controversy because many people doubted that these toxins could move through the food chain and cause neurological damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Davis said: 'It inspired our research here in Florida, where the same toxins have been detected in the marine food web.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most concerning toxins include BMAA and its chemical relatives 2,4-Diaminobutyric acid (2,4-DAB) and N-2-aminoethylglycine (AEG), all highly toxic to nerve cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Animal studies have shown that exposure can produce Alzheimer's-like brain damage and cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Scientists said that Miami-Dade County (pictured in part) had one of the highest rates of Alzheimer's in the US last year, and the region also experienced major algal blooms in 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists found the hallmarks of Alzheimer's in the brains of all the dolphins tested, including misfolded tau proteins (center), amyloid plaques (left) and tangled fibers (right) that destroy neural connections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once released into marine environments, these toxins can accumulate up the food chain, eventually reaching dolphins and potentially humans who consume contaminated seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Any exposure to these toxins is concerning,' Davis told the Daily Mail. 'In Florida, doses are likely lower and spread over longer periods, but we don't yet know the long-term effects on humans.' For that, he said, we'd need long-term studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[That] is why experimental models like dolphins are so important,' he added. 'They help us understand potential impacts on public health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers are now closely monitoring Florida's waterways and seafood supply for cyanobacterial toxins, aiming to better understand the risk to residents and prevent long-term neurological harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They routinely collect samples of fish, shellfish and even water used in aquaculture from areas affected by algal blooms. These samples are then tested in laboratories using chemical analyses such as liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, which can detect even trace amounts of harmful cyanotoxins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testing often happens before seafood enters the commercial market - for example, at fisheries, docks and seafood processing plants - to ensure contaminated catches are not distributed. In some cases, restaurants and retail markets may also be subject to random spot checks by state inspectors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When toxins are detected, harvest areas are closed until levels return to safe limits. For consumers, this means that the seafood they buy at markets or order at restaurants has likely already passed through several layers of testing and monitoring, designed to catch contamination long before it reaches their plates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;The team studied 20 dolphins stranded on the shores of Florida's Indian River Lagoon (pictured), finding they all had signs of Alzheimer's &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Davis emphasized the difference in exposure levels between Florida and Guam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Obviously, in Guam, people had a really high dose and developed the disease rapidly,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Here, we're probably looking at smaller doses over longer periods of time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Environmental studies also suggest that the surroundings play a role in Alzheimer's risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With Miami‑Dade facing high Alzheimer's rates and repeated algal blooms, the potential connection between these toxins and neurodegenerative disease is a public health concern,' Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Understanding and mitigating exposure is critical for protecting communities.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2025-2026-influenza-activity.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;classified&lt;/a&gt; it as a “high severity season”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A total of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a1.htm?s_cid=OS_mm7436a1_w" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;109 children&lt;/a&gt; were diagnosed with encephalopathy, or brain swelling, related to flu infection, with one-third of those patients suffering acute necrotizing encephalopathy. Three-quarters of the patients with brain swelling needed to be admitted to the intensive care unit, and one in five died from the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Among the children who were eligible for the vaccine, 89% had not been fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC is launching a new national campaign to “raise awareness and empower Americans with the tools they need to stay healthy during the respiratory virus season”, said Emily Hilliard, press secretary for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hilliard did not mention the role of vaccines or respond to a request for more information about the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pediatricians and other trusted figures are stepping into the communications gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We saw a really bad season last year, and I worry that this season could be even worse,” said Jonathan Miller, associate chief of primary care at Nemours Children’s Health and president of the Delaware chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Caitlin Rivers, director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at the Johns Hopkins University, said: “Pediatricians, family doctors, pharmacies are all really important sources of information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pediatricians are the most trusted source of information on vaccines, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-the-washington-post-survey-of-parents/#c1001c76-8dd1-4230-8b89-58d04f9f1cba--h-trust-in-sources-of-vaccine-information" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; by the nonpartisan group KFF. Some 85% of parents said they trust their pediatrician a “great deal” or “fair amount” when it comes to information on vaccines. Only a third of parents said the same of Robert F Kennedy Jr, the HHS secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I feel optimistic that parents will listen to pediatricians and to primary care providers when we encourage them to do this,” Miller said. He works with primary care providers at his facility to recommend the flu vaccine “at every opportunity”, when patients come in for routine visits, follow-ups, or even some sick visits, if they’re well enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Every child benefits from getting vaccinated, Miller said, adding: “If you are high-risk as a child for flu, you are more likely to have bad outcomes, but a lot of kids who are otherwise healthy also have bad outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nearly half (44%) of the children who died last winter had no underlying conditions and common conditions such as asthma are among the underlying conditions adding to risk, Rivers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“People don’t always perceive themselves or their kids as being at higher risk, but, in fact, they may be,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Although the flu vaccine doesn’t stop onward transmission entirely, it does lessen it. “It reduces the risk of you passing on the virus to other people,” Rivers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last season, the hardest-hit group was infants under the age of six months, who cannot yet get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC’s “wild to mild” campaign, which focused on how flu vaccines protect against severe illness and death, first began in 2023 and was “very, very well received” among the public, said Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, at a recent press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The health department suspended it soon after Trump took office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the CDC, “they’re not allowed to talk about that campaign, despite the fact that it had very clear messaging”, Daskalakis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Even before the shutdown, there has been really a concerted effort to limit communication around vaccines, specifically influenza,” he said, noting that he expects “that we’re not going to see a brisk uptake of flu vaccine” since “there’s already a lot of confusion around vaccines because of what’s happened with RFK Jr”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the absence of clear guidance, health providers may hesitate to offer vaccines against respiratory illnesses such as flu, Covid, and RSV, Daskalakis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But medical groups, such as the AAP, are making vaccination recommendations, and the American Lung Association &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-lung-association-launches-campaign-to-educate-people-living-with-lung-cancer-and-lung-disease-about-critical-vaccines-302590505.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new campaign in October to educate people on vaccines for the respiratory season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Providers and health systems are also stepping up local vaccine messages, giving the shots greater prominence than in years past, Miller said. For families skeptical of the shot, providers can offer the nasal-spray vaccines, he said. They’re very safe and effective, and they can be given to children two years and older without medical contraindications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think that’s helping some families feel more comfortable getting vaccinated than they otherwise would have been,” Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Making it easy to remember and schedule the shots also helps, Rivers said. “People respond really well to convenience and reminders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC’s Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/season-outlook25-26.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;expects&lt;/a&gt; this year’s respiratory virus season to be similar to last year’s. Yet severe outbreaks in Australia and Japan, the latter of which has declared a flu epidemic, has experts concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s not a direct lesson for what we can expect, but it’s a clue,” Rivers said. “And that does give me pause that maybe we’ll be in for something a little bit bigger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Respiratory viruses are “unpredictable” and can mutate and change, Miller pointed out. The best way to stay protected is to get updated vaccines each year, he said. During the US government shutdown, the CDC did not publish data on national flu trends as it normally does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s very laborious and difficult, I think, for the average person to access high-quality data right now compared to when CDC is participating in reporting,” Rivers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While states report some of the data publicly, “it’s just data”, Rivers said. “If you’re not accustomed to looking at the data and understanding what it means, it might not give you enough information to really make choices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And the lack of guidance signals a worrying trend, Rivers said: “There are very severe possible consequences for allowing our public health system to degrade.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 14:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOZE8telAydVlvXzhUZUdyQWpPVDI3RTVEZzU4a29wSXZBNC1TOWpjcUdxdk5BUUNCZk0xVnp4c2lpa0lYWnRfVGtsMXBtT056VkFheFhfZTFYWjN2QW1xaGNYbnhCUlRRRVMydzd6R0ZJUHZpZjYxT3JQSm10VFdHaEJLU1lmOHo0</guid></item><item><title>北格伦报告的Parvo疫情，控制在单身家庭：警方- kdvr.com</title><link>https://kdvr.com/news/local/parvo-outbreak-reported-in-northglenn-contained-to-single-home-police/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

In an Instagram video posted on November 10, the neuroscientist explains how vitamin deficiencies, poor sleep, and chronic &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/california-gastroenterologist-reveals-5-foods-to-heal-gut-inflammation-and-what-to-avoid-eat-colour-crunch-and-101762409288497.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="inflammation"&gt;inflammation &lt;/a&gt;can act as hidden triggers for dementia, ultimately increasing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vitamin D deficiency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Robert, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/surgeon-warns-against-vitamin-d-supplements-too-much-can-backfire-and-damage-your-arteries-101761291956952.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="vitamin D"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; deficiency is one of the surprising yet major risk factors for getting Alzheimer’s. He explains, “Most of us don't get enough vitamin D because we spend most of our time inside. So, you can get 20 minutes of sunshine exposure a day, or you can take a vitamin D supplement. I do both.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Inadequate sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/hyderabad-cardiologist-explains-what-poor-sleep-and-high-stress-do-to-your-heart-101761225168848.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Poor sleep"&gt;Poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; isn’t just about feeling tired - it’s one of the major contributors to a wide range of health problems and a significant risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Robert highlights, “Sleep is when you repair your brain. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;It's when you rewire memories, wire up new memories, and it's when you get a literal brain washing with the glymphatic system, which is basically like the lymphatic system for your brain.&lt;/span&gt;” &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;He recommends making sure you limit your screen exposure at least an hour before bedtime by turning off your TV and phone, and prioritising at least eight hours of good sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/11/original/alzheimers_graphic_1762864547768.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="These are the risk factors outlined by Robert.(Image generated via ChatGPT)" title="These are the risk factors outlined by Robert.(Image generated via ChatGPT)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;These are the risk factors outlined by Robert.(Image generated via ChatGPT)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Inflammation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Inflammation is another key risk factor linked to Alzheimer’s, and Robert emphasises that the process can begin as early as 30 years before any visible signs of dementia appear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; He explains, “Inflammation is caused by a variety of things - &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/stress" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="stress"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, bad diet, sedentary lifestyle. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;So the best way to reduce your inflammation is to avoid ultra-processed food, spend time with people you love and spend time outside in nature.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;Getting older might seem like a slow, gradual process – but research suggests that this is not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, if you wake up one morning, look in the mirror, and wonder if your aging somehow accelerated, you might not be imagining things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a 2024 study into the molecular changes associated with aging, humans experience two abrupt lurches forward, one at the average age of 44 and the other at around age 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/longevity-supplement-rejuvenates-aging-immune-cells-in-just-4-weeks"&gt;Longevity Supplement 'Rejuvenates' Aging Immune Cells in Just 4 Weeks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not just changing gradually over time; there are some really dramatic changes," geneticist Michael Snyder of Stanford University &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in August 2024 when the research was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It turns out the mid-40s is a time of dramatic change, as is the early 60s. And that's true no matter what class of molecules you look at."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the study's findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging is a complex process &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-could-be-caused-by-brain-cells-that-age-too-fast"&gt;associated with an increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of various diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder and his colleagues investigated the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-how-young-blood-reverses-aging-in-human-skin-cells"&gt;biology of aging&lt;/a&gt; to gain a deeper understanding of what changes occur and how, in order to better mitigate and treat these ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tracked a group of 108 adults, who had been donating biological samples every few months over several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noticed that in&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-021-09910-5"&gt; some conditions&lt;/a&gt;, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="180677" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2308-3425/6/2/19"&gt; cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, risk doesn't rise gradually with time; it escalates sharply after a certain age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So they wanted to take a closer look at the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-blood-of-exceptionally-long-lived-people-suggests-key-differences"&gt;biomarkers of aging&lt;/a&gt; to see if they could identify related changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_132987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132987" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors.jpg" alt="An older male squatting with outstretched arms in a park" class="wp-image-132987 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132987" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The molecular changes associated with aging show that humans experience two drastic lurches forward.

The different molecules studied include RNA, proteins, lipids, and microbiome taxa from the gut, skin, nasal, and oral regions, for a total of 135,239 biological features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant submitted an average of 47 samples over 626 days, with the longest-serving participant providing 367 samples. This wealth of data resulted in more than 246 billion data points, which the researchers then processed, looking for patterns in the changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several previous studies have found non-linear changes in molecular abundances that can be linked to aging in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(19)31091-5"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0673-2"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies of fruit flies, mice, and zebrafish have also pointed to a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging/articles/10.3389/fragi.2024.1378351/full"&gt;stepwise aging process in these species&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder and his colleagues observed a distinct change in the abundance of many different kinds of molecules in the human body at two distinct stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 81 percent of all the molecules they studied showed changes during one or both of these stages. Changes peaked in the mid-40s, and again in the early 60s, with slightly different profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mid-40s peak showed changes in molecules related to the metabolism of lipids, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/caffeine-in-your-blood-may-affect-body-fat-and-diabetes-risk-study-reveals"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, and alcohol, as well as cardiovascular disease, and dysfunctions in skin and muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early 60s peak was associated with carbohydrate and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="180677" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; metabolism, cardiovascular disease, skin and muscle, immune regulation, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-7-common-daily-habits-could-be-damaging-your-kidneys"&gt;kidney function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-new-class-of-drug-created-that-fights-aging-on-a-cellular-level"&gt;A New Class of Drug Created That Fights Aging on a Cellular Level&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first peak, the mid-40s, is typically when women start undergoing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/menopause-isnt-as-responsible-for-lost-libido-as-we-always-thought"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hidden-mental-health-risks-of-perimenopause-identified-for-first-time"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;, but the researchers ruled this out as a main factor: Men, too, also underwent significant molecular changes at the same age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that while menopause or perimenopause may contribute to the changes observed in women in their mid-40s, there are likely other, more significant factors influencing these changes in both men and women," &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html"&gt;explained metabolomicist and first author Xiaotao Shen&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of Stanford, now at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Identifying and studying these factors should be a priority for future research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144095" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144095" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1.jpg" alt="A young woman's face next to an older woman's face, both are smiling" class="size-full wp-image-144095" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144095" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Changes peaked in the mid-40s, and again in the early 60s.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A berry used in traditional folk medicine holds a remarkable power to restore healthy fat metabolism as well as insulin sensitivity in a diabetes model in mice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tiny red fruit come from a little-known shrub called &lt;a href="https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:873340-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nitraria roborowskii &lt;/em&gt;Kom.&lt;/a&gt; (NRK), which grows in the dry temperate regions of Western and Northern China, Mongolia, and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have a long history in local folk medicine, and scientists suspected that modern pharmacology could explain why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/natural-glp-1-triggers-ozempic-alternatives"&gt;Experts Reveal a Drug-Free Way to Mimic The Effects of Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A plant from the same genus,&lt;a href="https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:873347-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Nitraria tangutorum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has already been found to lower blood levels of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/d3fo02495d"&gt;lipids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.130412"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt; in animal models, so a team led by Di Wu of Qinghai University in China tested whether NRK could have similar effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A concentrated extract of the berry given to diabetic mice not only normalized their blood sugar levels, but also improved their lipid (fat) metabolism and reduced oxidative stress associated with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="180875" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breadth of effects is rarely seen in single manufactured drugs, the authors note, which suggests the berry extract may be fundamentally resetting the body's underlying metabolic issues, rather than acting on individual symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results are exciting because they suggest we might be able to treat diabetes more holistically," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1092492"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; organic chemist Huilan Yue, from the Northwestern Institute of Plateau Biology in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Instead of just lowering blood sugar like most medications, this plant extract appears to help the body regain its natural metabolic balance. The implications could extend beyond diabetes to other conditions involving insulin resistance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighty male mice were divided into groups at random: 14 were assigned to a control group, fed normal chow, and 65 were part of the model type-2 diabetes group, in which they were fed high-sugar and high-fat chow and injected with streptozotocin, to kill off the insulin-producing cells in their livers (one mouse didn't make it to the main experiment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 'diabetic' mice, some were given no treatment, some were given &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt; (a common diabetes medicine), and the rest were treated with low, medium, and high doses of concentrated NRK extract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across seven weeks, the scientists measured the animals' weights and fasting blood glucose levels. After this period, the mice were killed so their blood and organs could be inspected more closely.&lt;br&gt;

A medium to high dose of concentrated NRK extract, however, brought those levels back down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180947" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180947" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/chinese-berry-fat-metabolism-results.jpg" alt="bar graphs show effects of diabetes model mice without treatment, with metformin treatment, and with low, medium and high NRK extract treatment, on measures of fat metabolism.

And, compared to diabetic mice not treated with the extract, insulin sensitivity was restored in NRK-treated mice by nearly 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their internal organs were also in far better shape by the end of the experiment, with their liver and pancreas seemingly protected from the damage that induced diabetes wrought on untreated mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite the increasing number of drugs related to the treatment of type 2 diabetes, many of them lead to drug tolerance and side effects affecting the health of the organism," the authors &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.13748/j.cnki.issn1007-7693.20240613"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NRK could "significantly improve fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance, hepatic glycogen levels and lipid levels, and significantly [reduce] insulin resistance of diabetic mice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All these results suggested that [concentrated NRK extract] might be a potential drug for improving insulin resistance and reducing hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes," they &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.13748/j.cnki.issn1007-7693.20240613"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.13748/j.cnki.issn1007-7693.20240613"&gt;Chinese Journal of Modern Applied Pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p class="wp-block-custom-everlit-iframe-embed"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="everlit-disclaimer"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audio recording is automated for accessibility.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 3,500 cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, cases have been reported in Texas so far this year, already reaching a 11-year high even though two more highly infectious months are left in the year, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uptick in whooping cough, which is especially contagious in children, has &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2024-2025_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf"&gt;coincided with a decline in vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; for the illness, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/whooping-cough-surges-vaccines-decline-us-rcna201853"&gt;disease experts&lt;/a&gt; who urge the best way to control the spread is to get vaccinated. They also say whooping cough tends to spike every few years and that there isn’t a way to completely wipe out the disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We practitioners and public health professionals are concerned because we are seeing a year-after-year trend of a significant increase in cases when this is preventable,” said Hector Ocaranza, a pediatrician and member of the &lt;a href="https://www.texmed.org/"&gt;Texas Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;’s Council on Science and Health Promotion. “Especially a disease that can have such a severe effect on infants, older people, and those who have chronic conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-alert-increase-pertussis-cases-texas"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; more than 3,500 cases of whooping cough through October, quadruple the number of cases during the same period last year, which saw a total of 1,907 cases, according to provisional data. The total so far is also 10 times the number of cases for all of 2023. This is the second consecutive year the state’s health agency has had to issue a &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-alert-increase-pertussis-cases-texas"&gt;health alert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency’s most recent alert, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-alert-increase-pertussis-cases-texas"&gt;published Nov. 3&lt;/a&gt;, noted that more than half of last year’s cases occurred in November and December, suggesting whooping cough cases will continue to climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason Bowling, professor and infectious disease specialist at UT Health San Antonio, the academic health center of The University of Texas at San Antonio, said this spike is aligning with the holiday season, further increasing the risk of whooping cough spreading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oftentimes parents with a newborn infant don’t feel comfortable telling people to wash their hands or not to visit if they have a cough during the holidays, but they need to feel empowered and comfortable to do that right now,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.cap.org/spokespersons/c.-leilani-valdes--md--mba--fcap/s/8a25bc04-0396-4e4b-b332-92d1d81e741c"&gt;Leilani Valdes&lt;/a&gt;, the chair of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Citizens Medical Center in Victoria, and a spokesperson for the College of American Pathologists, said this year’s spike is noticeably different. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While an increase isn’t completely unexpected, the size of this one is unusual and something public health officials are keeping a close eye on,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valdes said multiple factors are contributing to the increase. She said immunity from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html"&gt;whooping cough vaccine&lt;/a&gt; fades over time, and if people aren’t getting their booster shots, they can catch and spread it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Some families have also fallen behind on vaccinations, which adds to the problem. And finally, better testing and awareness mean more cases are being identified and reported,” Valdes said. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/whooping-cough/symptoms-causes/syc-20378973"&gt;Whooping cough&lt;/a&gt; cases in Texas and the United States were lower than usual during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, but activity has quickly rebounded over the last few years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were not near each other during COVID-19, which meant fewer opportunities for the bacteria to move from person to person,” said Joshua Sharfstein, a pediatric medical provider and a public health professor at Johns Hopkins University. “What is concerning with this spike is the number of small children being affected.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent rise in whooping cough in Texas follows a national trend. In 2024, there were more than &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/175367"&gt;35,000 documented cases&lt;/a&gt;, a significant jump from 7,063 in 2023. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5576494/louisiana-whooping-cough-pertussis-infant-deaths"&gt;Two babies&lt;/a&gt; have died from the disease in Louisiana this year, as well as a &lt;a href="https://doh.sd.gov/press-releases/south-dakota-department-of-health-reports-pertussis-death/"&gt;child in South Dakota&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://cdh.idaho.gov/cdh-alerts-about-death-from-pertussis/"&gt;adult in Idaho&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preliminary data from the Texas health agency indicate that approximately 85% of whooping cough cases in Texas this year have occurred in children, but no deaths have been reported. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is whooping cough? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whooping cough is a highly contagious illness caused by the bacteria &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7813/"&gt;Bordetella pertussis&lt;/a&gt;. These &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/whooping-cough/symptoms-causes/syc-20378973"&gt;contagious respiratory illnesses&lt;/a&gt; occur when bacteria attach to the upper respiratory tract, leading to swelling of the airways.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The interesting thing about this bacterial infection is that it lasts for a long time. In China, it’s known as the 100-day cough for this reason. It’s a disease that is really split into three phases,” said Bowling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disease usually starts off looking like a regular cold, with a runny nose, a fever and a mild cough. This is the most transmissible phase of the disease. An &lt;a href="https://www.uchealth.org/today/pertussis-precautions-whooping-cough-outbreaks-infections-in-us/"&gt;estimated 80% people&lt;/a&gt; will contract the illness after close exposure to someone who is infected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after a week or two, that cough can turn into prolonged, intense coughing fits that can make it hard to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“In adolescents and adults, it’s just a really bad cough. In babies, it’s a cough related to the struggle to breathe, and it makes this huge gasp sound like a whoop, and that is why it’s known as a whooping cough,” said Sharfstein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final phase, known as the recovery stage, can last several weeks, during which the cough gradually fades. Still, the person remains at risk of other respiratory infections due to airway damage, and the cough can return, sometimes for several months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who is vulnerable?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babies under six months are most at risk because they’re too young to be fully vaccinated. One in three babies with &lt;a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/whooping-cough.html"&gt;whooping cough requires hospitalization&lt;/a&gt;, while one in five will develop pneumonia, and some will develop seizures or brain swelling. Many infants with the illness don’t cough at all but gag, and have skin, lips, or nails that turn blue or purple because of a pause in breathing that lasts longer than 20 seconds, often known as life-threatening &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5331238/"&gt;apnea&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You have to be fast and test quickly if you think your baby has been exposed. The challenge is that the further along in the disease when the coughing and spasms appear, the damage is already done, and it’s too late to treat the bacteria,” said Sharfstein. “If you have a 10-year-old who has been coughing all the time, and you notice the newborn baby now has a cold, I would test right away.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Healthy teens and adults can also catch whooping cough and may develop pneumonia. The coughing fits may cause vomiting, fatigue, and even broken ribs. Still, the risk of death significantly drops compared to infants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If caught early enough, antibiotics can help make the illness milder and stop it from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One of the worst things I have witnessed in my pediatric career is the helplessness of parents as they watch their young one struggle to breathe from pertussis. It’s awful, but it’s preventable,” said Sharfstein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to protect yourself? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DSHS states in its health alert that the best way to protect against whooping cough is immunization, and that parents should ensure children are up to date on pertussis immunizations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis vaccine, better known as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/current-vis/tdap.html"&gt;Tdap&lt;/a&gt;, is for children 7 years old and older, adolescents, and adults, while the diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis vaccine, known as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/current-vis/dtap.html"&gt;DTaP&lt;/a&gt;, is for children between 6 weeks and 6 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also recommended that pregnant women receive the &lt;a href="https://immunize.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/sample_vis_dtap.pdf"&gt;DTaP vaccine&lt;/a&gt; during each pregnancy to pass protection to their newborns. Optimal timing is between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation, preferably during the earlier part of this period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/outbreaks/index.html"&gt;also recommends&lt;/a&gt; that everyone around the infant be up to date with their booster shots, which are recommended every 10 years. The majority of whooping cough cases in infants &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/public-health/infectious-diseases/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-pertussis"&gt;are transmitted&lt;/a&gt; by parents, grandparents, or other family members.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, many adults believe they don’t need vaccinations anymore and don’t get the boosters,” said Ocaranza. “But the best practice shows that those young people who are about to start a family and those around them need to be updated on their vaccinations.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the vaccine is the best way to prevent the spread of the disease, various regions across the state are experiencing low vaccination rates in schools, increasing the risk of an outbreak among children. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The measles outbreak in Texas was a warning bell ringing that people weren’t getting vaccinated enough,” said Sharfstein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2024-2025_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf"&gt;Texas schools that report immunization rates&lt;/a&gt; to DSHS, 93.4% of seventh graders were fully vaccinated with Tdap in the 2024-25 school year, and 92.9% of kindergarteners were fully vaccinated with the DTaP. Coverage rates for those and other vaccines required for school admission &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/08/18/texas-school-vaccination-budget-cuts/"&gt;have declined in recent years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Simple steps like washing your hands, covering your cough, and keeping distance from babies when ill can go a long way in preventing the spread,” Valdes said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immunized children and adults can also still get the disease. The immunized may present with milder symptoms and lack the classic “whoop” sound during coughing. Someone suspected of having whooping cough should stay home until they have completed five days of antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Women should not suffer through menopause with hot flashes, night sweats and poor sleep. That's the message from FDA Commissioner &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/10/nx-s1-5604283/fda-menopause-hormone-therapy" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Marty Makary.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The agency announced it will remove "black box" warning labels from estrogen-based hormone therapy, which treat the symptoms of menopause, saying the warnings have made women scared to try the therapy and doctors reluctant to prescribe it. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The warnings stem from the early 2000s when data from the &lt;a href="https://www.whi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Women's Health Initiative study&lt;/a&gt; found hormone therapy increased risks of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But, women in that study were given a type of hormone therapy formulation that is no longer commonly used. And the average age of women in the study was 63, which is now considered too late to start hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, experts say there's a lot more known about safe and effective combinations, when therapy is initiated earlier.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"If you're under age 60 or within ten years of menopause onset, when you start hormone therapy, you're going to see improvements in hot flashes, sweats, fewer sleep disruptions, " says &lt;a href="https://uvahealth.azcontentstackapps.com/providers/JoAnn-Pinkerton-1437283801" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton&lt;/a&gt;, a menopause expert at the University of Virginia Health. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She also points to protection against bone loss and fractures, as well as potential benefits for heart health, brain fog and overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When it's dosed appropriately, hormone therapy can be given safely and have multiple benefits," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But here's an important reality check: "Not all women can take hormone therapy," Pinkerton says. She says some women have medical conditions or symptoms that can make hormone therapy risky.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's really important that women have a discussion with an informed health care provider because you want to know what are the benefits and risks for you," Pinkerton says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So, here are some things to consider when talking to your healthcare provider about hormone therapy for menopause.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;1. When should you start hormone therapy? &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Experts recommend starting estrogen therapy before the age of 60 or within ten years of the start of menopause — which begins one year after your last period. Many women remain on birth control through perimenopause, which can help with hot flashes and night sweats as hormones fluctuate. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once you're through the menopause transition and you don't need pregnancy prevention, then it doesn't make as much sense to use birth control, Pinkerton says, because it's typically stronger than the amount of estrogen used in menopause hormone therapy, so that's a good time to talk to your provider about hormone therapy options.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;2. How long should you be on hormone therapy?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In general, women stay on hormone therapy for three to five years, but that's not a hard and fast rule. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For women who have persistent symptoms or bone loss — which can be treated with hormone therapy — we will continue it," Pinkerton says. But, it's important to keep assessing each year. "It's about working with the patient to come up with what's safest and best," Pinkerton says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We don't take someone off [hormone therapy] just because it's been three to five years, " says Lauren Streicher of Northwestern University. She points to differences in how long menopause symptoms persist, noting that Black and Hispanic women tend to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4433164/#:~:text=%2C%209.4%20years).-,Women%20who%20were%20postmenopausal%20at%20the%20onset%20of%20VMS%20had,per%20week%20were%20statistically%20significant." target="_blank"&gt;experience symptoms for longer &lt;/a&gt;  time periods.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3. How has hormone therapy changed?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Science has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/01/1248525256/hormones-menopause-hormone-therapy-hot-flashes" target="_blank"&gt;evolved over the last 20 years&lt;/a&gt;, since the results of the Women's Health Initiative came out. And, importantly, there's been a shift in how estrogen is administered, as well as new formulations of hormones. For instance, many women are now prescribed patches instead of pills.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We know that oral therapy can slightly increase the risk of blood clots and stroke," Pinkerton says, so providers often opt for transdermal therapy for women at risk of these conditions. Transdermal patches, gels or rings deliver estrogen that is absorbed directly through the skin which research shows can&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30626577/" target="_blank"&gt; lower the risk&lt;/a&gt; of blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Also, women enrolled in the WHI study were given synthetic progestin which was linked to an increased breast cancer risk. But, now doctors can prescribe &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=micronized+progesterone&amp;amp;sca_esv=0921862a250ef5a9&amp;amp;rlz=1C1GCFQ_enUS1108US1108&amp;amp;ei=WBgRac3EENug5NoPruXaaA&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwi97o_WkeaQAxUnMlkFHUDKGdwQgK4QegQIARAC&amp;amp;uact=5&amp;amp;oq=what+is+the+new+type+of+micronized+progesterone+for+menopause+with+transdermal+estrogen&amp;amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiV3doYXQgaXMgdGhlIG5ldyB0eXBlIG9mIG1pY3Jvbml6ZWQgcHJvZ2VzdGVyb25lIGZvciBtZW5vcGF1c2Ugd2l0aCB0cmFuc2Rlcm1hbCBlc3Ryb2dlbkiPQFD2AljDPnABeAGQAQCYAZoBoAHZDaoBBDE5LjO4AQPIAQD4AQGYAg2gAscJwgIKEAAYsAMY1gQYR8ICBRAhGKABwgIFECEYnwXCAgUQIRirApgDAIgGAZAGCJIHAzguNaAHmn2yBwM3LjW4B7wJwgcFMC43LjbIBzM&amp;amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp&amp;amp;mstk=AUtExfCrBsvpMmtLAmg31UA0nlsOnqf0NnCVPhv3Nfoib12HCSlJMxQS8b8YxjwWbRNuCwkwLG4rExnNwFVqXYjS50EYObYF-BqpAwU-QoYPE2sKIz7jkzGv0JoQYcbKNCPD8JKHX5LfBKziVqqDj0EF1y3WSQxQNhl9RqRVoVegEnrjYyWlHjmqB8Vhgi6MdVFGglEZ&amp;amp;csui=3" target="_blank"&gt; micronized progesterone&lt;/a&gt; that has fewer side effects. Micronized progesterone is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4960754/#:~:text=Micronized%20progesterone%20is%20a%20bioidentical%20hormone%20with,have%20a%20different%20chemical%20structure%20from%20progesterone." target="_blank"&gt;a bioidentical hormone &lt;/a&gt;with a molecular structure identical to the estrogen produced in the ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;4. Do all estrogen products carry the same risks?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;No. Local estrogen, such as low-dose vaginal creams, target symptoms such as vaginal dryness, painful sex, bladder control and reduced risk of urinary tract infections. This is different from systemic estrogen, delivered through pills, patches or gels. Systemic estrogen is a higher-dose treatment that circulates throughout the body to address symptoms including hot flashes and night sweats, and can carry a higher risk of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I think most would agree that with local, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy that the risks are negligible," says &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/monica-christmas" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Monica Christmas&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Menopause Program at the University of Chicago. "For local, vaginal estrogen, it's reasonable to remove the black box warning. I don't think we need to scare people unnecessarily," Christmas says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, for higher dose, systemic estrogen therapy — which is absorbed into the blood stream — including estrogen pills, Christmas and other menopause experts are more equivocal about removing the black box warning. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It provides a pause," Christmas says, and prompts patients to discuss the risks with their providers."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;5. Who should avoid hormone therapy? &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some women have medical conditions that can make hormone therapy more risky. This includes women with estrogen sensitive breast or uterine cancer, and women who are at high risk for or have had a heart attack, stroke, blood clot, or pulmonary embolism.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's really important that women have a discussion with an informed health care provider because you want to know what are the benefits and risks for you," Pinkerton says&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;6. Are there alternatives for women who don't  want to take hormone therapy?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has approved two non-hormonal medications to treat severe hot flashes in menopause. According to the FDA, about 80% of menopausal women experience hot flashes which can include &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-novel-drug-treat-moderate-severe-hot-flashes-caused-menopause#:~:text=Some%20women%20who%20experience%20hot,to%20test%20for%20liver%20damage." target="_blank"&gt;sweating, flushing and chills&lt;/a&gt; that last for several minutes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lynkuet-us.com/?utm_campaign=LYN_DTC_cpc_google_BRN&amp;amp;utm_content=BRN_MNP_ALL_PHR_X_X&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=23215908903&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAABB5RiLZ5oBFBGqfgVIyEJR-VRW8yM&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA5abIBhCaARIsAM3-zFVYIqChCDYO99CXDWF-XQWEI_KUpri5jr-FEzmEnRyEGs2YtdQNifUaAg19EALw_wcB" target="_blank"&gt;Lynkuet&lt;/a&gt;, which was approved last month, and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-novel-drug-treat-moderate-severe-hot-flashes-caused-menopause#:~:text=Some%20women%20who%20experience%20hot,to%20test%20for%20liver%20damage." target="_blank"&gt;Veozah&lt;/a&gt;, which was approved in 2023, are both oral medications that work by &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-novel-drug-treat-moderate-severe-hot-flashes-caused-menopause#:~:text=Some%20women%20who%20experience%20hot,to%20test%20for%20liver%20damage." target="_blank"&gt;targeting the neural activity&lt;/a&gt; that causes hot flashes during menopause. Lynkuet has been shown to reduce the severity and frequencies of hot flashes. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health has &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/menopause/hot-flashes-what-can-i-do" target="_blank"&gt;tips for managing symptoms,&lt;/a&gt; including limiting alcohol and caffeine, and maintaining a healthy body weight. And early-stage research shows hypnotherapy and mindfulness meditation may help manage hot flashes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some people find herbal remedies helpful. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5783135/" target="_blank"&gt; A study of medicinal plants&lt;/a&gt; including sage, lemon balm, red clover and licorice finds they may be effective in the treatment of menopausal symptoms like hot flashes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"It was almost 30 years that I had not taken care of my body," she tells PEOPLE, adding that she "probably was in a really deep depression" while leading a "sedentary lifestyle for a number of decades." She adds: "I really wanted to say thank you and celebrate my body for not giving up on me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding herself at a better place in her life, Susanne still felt like there were improvements to be made. She stumbled across the work of Beverly Hills, Calif.,-based plastic surgeon and Artisa Skincare founder &lt;a href="https://www.doctortruesdale.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Carl Truesdale;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Carl Truesdale&lt;/a&gt;, who's gone social media viral for his life-changing alterations, and thought to herself, "There's got to be something to this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Carl Truesdale&lt;/p&gt; Susanne before and after her life-changing cosmetic enhancment&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, Susanne says she "never really gave a thought at all" to plastic surgery, because looking good was never a "motivating factor" behind her weight loss. But something clicked and suddenly she found herself just "going for it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 3, Susanne reached out to Dr. Truesdale's team and was looking at about a month-long timeline to lock in for her surgery. "I'm thinking, 'Oh, how is this all going to happen?' But I said, 'Yes.' I put it out in the universe because once you speak your word, it's not any of my business how it unfolds...I just kept moving forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fate was written all over Susanne's surgery. She reveals that she prepared herself to work with a different doctor after Dr. Truesdale was scheduled to go on vacation on her planned surgery date. However, a glitch in his itinerary ended up connecting the two anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Carl Truesdale&lt;/p&gt; Susanne before and after her surgery performed by Dr. Carl Truesdale&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susanne, who had then turned 70, decided to get eight procedures in one sitting: a deep plane facelift, neck lift, upper blepharoplasty, lower blepharoplasty, fat transfer from her inner thighs to her hands and face, an eyebrow lift, lip lift and a laser treatment to rejuvenate the skin. She recalls the entire operation happening over eight hours, while she accelerated her recovery by doing a 90-minute oxygen therapy treatment for three days after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Truesdale was given a reference photo of Susanne at 28 that she felt "really captured who I was at that time." And while &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOO99t4ktyP/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the transformation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the transformation&lt;/a&gt;, in Dr. Truesdale's words, turned back the clock and made his client look 40 again, Susanne says, "Was I trying to get back there? It wasn't like, 'Oh, I have to be that age again.' I really love who I am."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she's noticed a "huge difference" and feels like her inner and outer glow are aligned. "I've always been very confident, but I love what I see now. I'm back in my size 4 and 6 clothes, and I got my own little swag. I think this only enhanced what I already was doing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susanne didn't disclose how much she had paid for surgery in her interview, however Dr. Truesdale's practice charges $115,000 to $125,000 for the same procedures, as shared in a statement with PEOPLE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Susanne doesn't see herself adding any more tweaks to her appearance. "I had asked [Dr. Truesdale] about that and he said, 'I think we're done.' That's really encouraging to know," she says.

The bats need to eat blood every two to three days to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"People are getting bitten by bats routinely and for many, many years nothing can happen

spread is believed to be climate change, with evidence that vampire bats in parts of Mexico are moving into new areas further north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The teams have witnessed an increasing spread of rabies across the landscape which is advancing at a rate of between 10km (6 miles) and 20km (12 miles) every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;They are aiming to improve understanding of the reasons for the spread to anticipate where communities are most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Since 2007, researchers have been taking blood and faeces samples from vampire bats at dozens of locations to check for signs of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Theses include monitoring rabies in bat caves in Peru, where nets are installed on cave entrances to capture the bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The samples are flown back to Glasgow for lab testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The results helps them track the spread so communities can be warned to take preventative action through vaccination of themselves and their

populations living in the rain forest are also behind the growth in vampire bat bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The introduction of livestock into some regions is providing new feeding opportunities for the mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Human attempts to catch and kill bats in areas where rabies is present is also understood to be driving infected animals into new areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In the long run, the teams are hoping to develop vaccination programmes that can be administered into the bat populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One way of doing this involves administering the vaccine onto the animals as a paste and relying on transmission through other bats licking the fur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The process has been tested in lab conditions with field trials expected to begin soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the process is self-limiting, meaning only those immediately surrounding the treated bat would ingest the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Scientists are also working on a transmissible vaccine which can spread throughout the population without having to rely solely on the original treated animal.

Sometimes, however, there are some inconsequential practices that we believe do no harm, but are risking cognitive decline and brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3 things that can harm your brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a November 4 Instagram post shared by Dr Bing, MD, MPH, a neurologist and biostatistician, he listed three things that he absolutely avoids as a &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/chennai-urologist-shares-if-men-go-through-male-menopause-what-is-andropause-mood-swings-libido-body-fat-warning-signs-101762766792208.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="neurologist"&gt;neurologist&lt;/a&gt; and recommends others avoid as well. The habits include practices such as wearing headphones for extended periods or to bed, neglecting gum health, and sitting on the toilet for an excessive amount of time. Here's how they damage your brain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Wearing headphones to bed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Bing cautioned against wearing headphones to bed. Here's why: “If you are one of those people who wear headphones to bed, just make sure that the sounds that you're playing are quiet and not loud because loud sounds can damage the hair cells in your inner ear and over time can raise your risk of hearing loss and dementia.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the neurologist emphasised that wearing earbuds and headphones for extended periods can trap moisture and bacteria. This can increase the risk of developing an ear infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you're listening to loud sounds during sleep, it might interrupt your deep sleep and disrupt your lymphatic system, which is your brain's nightly cleaning cycle that cleans out toxins,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Ignoring gum health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the neurologist advised against ignoring gum health. Sharing his routine, Dr Bing revealed, “Every night, I floss and I water floss and then I brush because recent studies have shown that gum health might be related to someone's brain health.” &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/11/original/brain_health_1762837356617.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Protect your grey matter. (Google Gemini)" title="Protect your grey matter. (Google Gemini)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Protect your grey matter. (Google Gemini)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The neurologist cited a 2025 study which found: “People with more gum disease and cavities had almost double the risk of stroke, and other studies have linked poor oral health to dementia and cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Sitting on the toilet for more than 5 minutes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the neurologist advised against sitting on the toilet for more than 5 minutes. He divulged, “This is because sitting too long and straining can cause blood to pool in your legs and drop your blood pressure, especially if you have certain underlying conditions, and not enough blood going to your brain can cause someone to faint.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the neurologist revealed that he sees such examples almost every week. However, he excused those with chronic bowel disease, as they might not have a choice, but otherwise, he cautioned, “Do not linger on the toilet.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

His first biopsy was taken in January 2024 when cancer was suspected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He did not receive any further contact from his cancer services, despite his best efforts, until January this year. He eventually had surgery on his colon in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;“The waiting was horrendous and now I think that if I had been treated properly and not had to wait so long it wouldn't have progressed to stage three,” Paul said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He is due to have further surgery next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Why hospitals are struggling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Hospitals say demand for testing and care is outstripping capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The BBC has also been told about when things go wrong, including scanning and radiotherapy machines breaking down, GP referral letters being lost and staffing issues mean appointments are cancelled at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;BBC Verify looked at performance across every major cancer service in England over the past 12 months – from September 2024 to August 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There are targets for each part of the cancer journey. Hospitals should:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;diagnose or rule out cancer in 75% of cases within 28 days of urgent referral&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;begin treatment in 96% of cases within another 31 days&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;ensure the whole journey takes no longer than 62 days in 85% of cases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Nearly one in four trusts have been missing all three targets over the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some of the major regional cancer hubs say they are struggling with inherited waits. Larger hospitals that offer specialist services often get complex patients passed on to them from smaller hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'We can't deliver care we want'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One service that is struggling with inherited waits is London's Royal Free NHS Trust, which is ranked 109 out of 121 for 62-day waits - although, like so many low ranking trusts, the performance is improving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It acts as a specialist kidney cancer centre for patients across south-east England. And while it has some new equipment, including robotic surgery theatres, administration problems can result in operations being cancelled. The day before the BBC filmed a report at the hospital, the theatre sat empty as a patient had not received the letter confirming surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Radiotherapy is another area the Royal Free wants to improve. One of its two machines is more than 10 years old - the age at which they should be retired because they become less efficient and less reliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Claire Hartill, head of radiotherapy at the Royal Free, says old equipment is an issue.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Claire Hartill, head of radiotherapy at the Royal Free, said: "We can't deliver the service we want to and it can cause delays to patient treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We need a newer machine – it delivers better treatment faster so means we can treat more people per hour."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The trust submitted a business plan to the government earlier this year for funding to buy a new machine, but was turned down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;How best-performers are doing it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There are just three cancer services that are achieving the 62-day target over the past 12 months - Calderdale and Huddersfield, East and North Hertfordshire and Bolton NHS trusts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Streamlined communication, state-of-the-art equipment and joined-up team work appear to be key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Paul, who is in his 50s, was diagnosed with prostate cancer a few weeks ago at the Lister Hospital in Stevenage, part of East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;On the day he was told his diagnosis he also met with a surgeon and an oncologist to discuss his treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;His treatment choice was between a long course of radiotherapy or to have the prostate surgically removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Once he had made up his mind to have an operation, it was booked in. His procedure will be done using robotic surgery. It not only reduces side effects, but also helps speed up recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Paul will only be in hospital for one night so the bed he uses will be free for another patient after only 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Paul has decided to have his prostate surgically removed &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"He [the surgeon] got his diary out, flicked through a couple of pages and gave me a date. I said, that's a Saturday. The surgeon said, yes, I work Saturdays," laughs Paul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Over in the chemotherapy ward there are more steps being taken to ease capacity issues. A new initiative - one of the first in England - is allowing patients on certain types of chemotherapy to be taught how to do the treatment for themselves at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Josephine Hoskins is one of them. She has to have chemotherapy injections every three weeks and lives between London and Devon.

He eventually had surgery on his colon in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;“The waiting was horrendous and now I think that if I had been treated properly and not had to wait so long it wouldn't have progressed to stage three,” Paul said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He is due to have further surgery next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Why hospitals are struggling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Hospitals say demand for testing and care is outstripping capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The BBC has also been told about when things go wrong, including scanning and radiotherapy machines breaking down, GP referral letters being lost and staffing issues - which means appointments are cancelled at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;BBC Verify looked at performance across every major cancer service in England over the past 12 months – from September 2024 to August 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There are targets for each part of the cancer journey. Hospitals should:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;diagnose or rule out cancer in 75% of cases within 28 days of urgent referral&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;begin treatment in 96% of cases within another 31 days&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;ensure the whole journey takes no longer than 62 days in 85% of cases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Nearly one in four trusts have been missing all three targets over the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some of the major regional cancer hubs say they are struggling with inherited waits. Larger hospitals that offer specialist services often get complex patients passed on to them from smaller hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'We can't deliver care we want'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One service that is struggling with inherited waits is London's Royal Free NHS Trust, which is ranked 109 out of 121 for 62-day waits - although, like so many low ranking trusts, the performance is improving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It acts as a specialist kidney cancer centre for patients across south-east England. And while it has some new equipment, including robotic surgery theatres, administration problems can result in operations being cancelled. The day before the BBC filmed a report at the hospital, the theatre sat empty as a patient had not received the letter confirming surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Radiotherapy is another area the Royal Free wants to improve. One of its two machines is more than 10 years old - the age at which they should be retired because they become less efficient and less reliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Claire Hartill, head of radiotherapy at the Royal Free, says old equipment is an issue.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Claire Hartill, head of radiotherapy at the Royal Free, said: "We can't deliver the service we want to and it can cause delays to patient treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We need a newer machine – it delivers better treatment faster so means we can treat more people per hour."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The trust submitted a business plan to the government earlier this year for funding to buy a new machine, but was turned down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;How best-performers are doing it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There are just three cancer services that are achieving the 62-day target over the past 12 months - Calderdale and Huddersfield, East and North Hertfordshire and Bolton NHS trusts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Streamlined communication, state-of-the-art equipment and joined-up team work appear to be key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Paul, who is in his 50s, was diagnosed with prostate cancer a few weeks ago at the Lister Hospital in Stevenage, part of East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;On the day he was told his diagnosis he also met with a surgeon and an oncologist to discuss his treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;His treatment choice was between a long course of radiotherapy or to have the prostate surgically removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Once he had made up his mind to have an operation, it was booked in. His procedure will be done using robotic surgery. It not only reduces side effects, but also helps speed up recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Paul will only be in hospital for one night so the bed he uses will be free for another patient after only 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Paul has decided to have his prostate surgically removed &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"He [the surgeon] got his diary out, flicked through a couple of pages and gave me a date.

She has to have chemotherapy injections every three weeks and lives between London and Devon. "It's revolutionised things for me," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Moving patients like Josephine to 'at-home chemo' immediately opens up another slot for someone that needs more complex treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'Determined to improve'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The government said it was determined to improve waiting times.

 building more community diagnostic centres, offering evening and weekend appointments and spending £70 million on new radiotherapy machines to get patients faster access to the tests, checks and scans they require."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But Sarah Scobie of the Nuffield Trust health think tank believes ministers will struggle to address the problems highlighted by the BBC analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The reality for the government is that it will be incredibly challenging to make meaningful progress on waiting times when finances are so tight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;About the data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;BBC News analysed official cancer waiting time statistics from NHS England, covering the 12 months from September 2024 to August 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The NHS publishes data monthly, but we have analysed the performance over the whole year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;We looked at performance by acute trusts against the three national targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Trusts were ranked according to their performance on the 62-day measure, which covers the entire waiting time between urgent referral and starting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;i id="additional-reporting-by-jess-carr-and-muskeen-liddar" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;&lt;b id="additional-reporting-by-jess-carr-and-muskeen-liddar" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Additional reporting by Jess Carr and Muskeen Liddar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 04:47:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9rRjhSTUc0bmVLQzdoSjczTzVob2lESEtWT3ZvYUd4aGZfS2hWYlJSbTNoUzJTb2dwZXhvVjlXYjAzNzRHS0VqaXQ1cl92a3NzZ3lGMG5rM0ZpZw</guid></item><item><title>帮助您击败冬季忧郁症的三种简单方法- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c051mdgd1ddo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;Three easy ways to help you beat the winter blues&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 eRlINq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/94e2/live/cc583db0-bed2-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/94e2/live/cc583db0-bed2-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/94e2/live/cc583db0-bed2-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/94e2/live/cc583db0-bed2-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/94e2/live/cc583db0-bed2-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/94e2/live/cc583db0-bed2-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/94e2/live/cc583db0-bed2-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/94e2/live/cc583db0-bed2-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images Stock photo shows a woman holding a takeaway cup of hot drink wearing blue jumper, gloves and a scarf with Christmas-like street lights in the background." class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Now the clocks have gone back and the evenings are darker, many of us are trudging to work and back in the dark and sometimes our mood is lower as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;We can feel more tired than normal, lack energy or find it difficult to concentrate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), or "&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7492e5x7jzo" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;winter depression&lt;/a&gt;" can affect anyone.

			&lt;p&gt;Poor health in one part of the body often leads to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gut-inflammation-linked-to-alzheimers-disease-yet-again"&gt;problems elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. A new study links gum disease with an increased risk of damage to the brain's white matter, which transmits signals around the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings aren't conclusive, but they suggest that persistent inflammation in the mouth could be harming the brain as well – and that practicing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-re-probably-brushing-your-teeth-wrong-here-are-4-expert-tips-for-better-dental-health"&gt;good oral hygiene&lt;/a&gt; may benefit white matter in the brain as well as gums and teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the study, led by a team from the University of South Carolina, were particularly interested in white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). These are key markers of cerebral small vessel disease or CSVD, which affects the brain's blood vessels and increases the chances of a stroke and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superager-brains-defy-cognitive-decline-we-finally-know-their-secret"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-popular-diet-seems-to-reduce-gum-disease-scientists-say"&gt;This Popular Diet Seems to Reduce Gum Disease, Scientists Say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study shows a link between gum disease and white matter hyperintensities suggesting oral health may play a role in brain health that we are only beginning to understand," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/5289"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Souvik Sen, vascular neurologist at the University of South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team looked at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dentist-visit-might-have-triggered-rare-brain-bleed-in-patient"&gt;dental exams&lt;/a&gt; and brain scans for 1,143 adult participants, finding that those with gum disease, or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"&gt;periodontal disease&lt;/a&gt;, (800 of the group) had a higher average volume of WMHs: 2.83 percent of total brain volume, compared to 2.52 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180674" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180674" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DentistCheck.jpg" alt="Dental checkup" class="wp-image-180674 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DentistCheck.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DentistCheck-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180674" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Good oral hygiene could be linked to brain health.

Even so, the statistics are suggestive enough to warrant further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gum disease is preventable and treatable," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251029100147.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sen. "If future studies confirm this link, it could offer a new avenue for reducing cerebral small vessel disease by targeting oral inflammation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as being associated with CSVD, WMHs also often increase &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-age-faster-at-2-specific-times-in-their-life-study-finds"&gt;with age&lt;/a&gt;. Their presence is thought to indicate underlying injuries in the brain, which can have an impact on abilities like balance, memory recall, and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How this might be exacerbated by gum disease isn't clear, but there's a growing amount of evidence that &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/inflammation-and-brain-health"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; – where the body's immune system goes into harmful overdrive in an attempt to protect itself – can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/crohns-disease-scientists-say-bacteria-in-the-mouth-may-be-a-cause"&gt;spread between conditions&lt;/a&gt; and between parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the same researchers have also recently &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/21-year-study-links-gum-disease-and-cavities-to-higher-stroke-risk"&gt;published a study&lt;/a&gt; that found an association between both gum diseases and tooth cavities, and having a higher risk of stroke. These links underline just how important oral health is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0022034512457373"&gt;almost half&lt;/a&gt; of adults in the US have some form of gum disease, tackling that problem could have knock-on benefits for health more generally. However, the researchers also raise the possibility that shared risk factors for blood vessel health are potentially affecting both gums and brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While more research is needed to understand this relationship, these findings add to growing evidence that keeping your mouth healthy may support a healthier brain," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251029100147.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WN9.0000000000000037"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology Open Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Both were babies who were exposed to the measles virus in the womb and born prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Measles elimination is a symbolic designation, but it represents a hard-won battle against the infectious disease. It is earned when a country shows it stopped continuous spread of the virus within local communities, though occasional cases might still pop up from travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="cf8e528e-76bc-4923-aa18-636fab396b7e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"A huge outbreak has made Ontario the measles centre of the western hemisphere","elementId":"cf8e528e-76bc-4923-aa18-636fab396b7e","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/06/measles-outbreak-ontario-canada"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Measles typically begins with a high fever followed by a telltale rash that starts on the face and neck. Most people recover, but it’s one of the leading causes of death among young children, according to the World &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Organization. Serious complications, including blindness and swelling of the brain, are more common in young children and adults over age 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is prevented by a vaccine administered routinely and safely to children around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s a deeply disheartening development. It’s a deeply worrisome development. And, frankly, it’s an embarrassing development,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University infectious disease expert. “No country with the amount of resources of Canada – or other countries in North America even – should lose their measles elimination status.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Canada eliminated measles in 1998, followed by the United States two years later. After hugely successful vaccination campaigns, the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt; became the first region in the world to be free of measles in 2016. Health officials estimate the measles vaccine prevented 6.2 millions deaths in the Americas between 2000 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But vaccination rates have since slipped below the 95% coverage rate needed to stop outbreaks. Large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019 cost the region its elimination status. It was reclaimed in 2024, but ends again with Canada’s loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts from the Pan American Health Organization, an independent health agency, made the determination after analyzing data on Canada’s outbreaks that showed the virus has spread continuously for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It has never been easy to stop measles from circulating in local communities, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization, said in a briefing Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“As a region, we have eliminated measles twice,” Barbosa said. “We can do it a third time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a statement, Canadian health officials said they were working with government and community partners to improve vaccination coverage, share data and provide evidence-based guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 02:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNWU41WGZnRzBTaXlycV9pWnc0ZjRTWEJLWTRGSW1ubzlOQWFxMlNSbjhZcmNXaG5PalRnLVFQT1JnNFFZbVJUSHF1djZVRjJGTVNnUWVEUWtwYlZZX0lSWkRJX210azhmU2s1UzJOV3MzbXBVVHN3eWJjcHN6Q0gxY0FtM3JtU01uUWZCbnlkTXBaQXF2</guid></item><item><title>男性生存率提高40% ：配对两种抗癌药物可降低前列腺癌死亡风险-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/40-boost-in-survival-for-men-pairing-two-cancer-drugs-may-reduce-prostate-cancer-death-risk/articleshow/125212555.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a moment where medical innovation meets real-life impact, the recent findings from the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2303974" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;landmark EMBARK trial, published in the The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, offer not just clinical news but a fresh lens on how men can engage with their health, lifestyle and future. The study has shown that pairing two drugs, namely Leuprolide (a testosterone-suppressing injection) and Enzalutamide (a pill that blocks residual effects of testosterone), results in a significant jump in survival for men with high-risk, recurring prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many men, prostate health can feel like a silent guest in the room that is quietly monitored, occasionally remarked upon but rarely occupying headline-status in everyday life. This study turns that narrative slightly by showing how we engage with the body, the screen-time, the check-ups, the mindset and all of it can ripple into meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Prostate Cancer Guide: Expert Reveals Causes and Prevention Strategies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The heart of the discovery&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study recruited more than 1,000 men across 17 countries who had undergone treatment for localised prostate cancer but then faced “biochemical recurrence”. In practical terms, their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were climbing, even though no outward metastasis had yet been detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These men were at high risk, defined by a PSA doubling time of nine months or less. That matters because a faster doubling time signals a more aggressive disease course. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were randomly assigned into one of three paths:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A combination treatment of Enzalutamide and Leuprolide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leuprolide alone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enzalutamide alone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;After roughly 5 years of follow-up, the results were striking. In the combination group, 5-year metastasis-free survival was 87.3%, compared with 71.4% in the Leuprolide alone group (hazard ratio for metastasis or death: 0.42). Enzalutamide alone also outperformed Leuprolide alone (80.0% 5-year survival) with a hazard ratio of 0.63.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Yet, it is not just the numbers that resonate, it is the lifestyle implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for everyday life&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biochemical recurrence does not always feel dramatic as the body may seem “okay” and the day-to-day may look normal but the molecular clock is ticking. Recognising the importance of early detection, through PSA monitoring, consulting with urologists and staying attentive to subtle changes can turn a passive stance into an empowered one. This study proves that early, targeted intervention works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment advances don’t override wellness, they amplify it. While the study’s focus is medication, the lifestyle narrative remains central that men who are attentive to health, who keep their check-ups and who stay in conversation with their doctors, are better positioned. Moreover, treatments that prolong “metastasis-free survival” mean more years where quality of life matters that is during weekends with friends, travel, hobbies, meaningful roles and yes, less anxiety about the “when will it spread” question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The mindset shift: From “let’s wait” to “let’s live”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the subtle takeaways is that when men know their health tools are evolving, there is less reason to feel resigned or passive. This becomes a story of maintenance and proactive wellbeing, not just “coping”. The combination therapy acts like an upgrade in the toolkit but the person holds the steering wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality of life still matters very much. A common concern with aggressive treatments is, “At what cost?” The study carefully measured patient-reported outcomes (quality-of-life indices) and found no substantial deterioration in the combination group compared to standard therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

It offers men and all of us interested in wellness, a clearer vision that proactive health is not just about eating better or exercising, it is about staying engaged, informed and intentional. When combined with advanced therapies like enzalutamide-plus-leuprolide, lifestyle becomes the foundation and medicine becomes the amplifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

A new study suggests that advice may need a rethink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers followed 200 people in the US, Canada, and Australia who were about to undergo &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/electrical-cardioversion"&gt;electrical cardioversion&lt;/a&gt; for atrial fibrillation (AF). All were current or former coffee drinkers. Half agreed to avoid coffee for six months; the other half agreed to drink at least one cup per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the six months, the researchers tracked AF recurrences lasting more than 30 seconds. In the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/giant-study-links-drinking-coffee-with-almost-2-extra-years-of-life"&gt;coffee-drinker&lt;/a&gt; group, 47 percent had an episode of AF, compared with 64 percent of abstainers. That equates to a 39 percent lower risk for coffee drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/caffeine-pouches-can-pack-2-coffees-in-1-hit-heres-why-theyre-a-risk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine Pouches Can Pack 2 Coffees in 1 Hit.

We know that coffee can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-coffee-boost-your-exercise-performance-here-s-what-three-experts-have-to-say"&gt;boost exercise performance&lt;/a&gt;, which could protect against AF episodes (the study didn't collect detailed diet/exercise data).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180856" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180856" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/AFRecurrence.jpg" alt="Atrial fibrillation chart" class="wp-image-180856 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/AFRecurrence.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/AFRecurrence-600x386.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180856" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cases of atrial fibrillation were less common in coffee drinkers.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors block a protein that tumor cells create to deactivate immune cells, essentially training patients' immune systems to kill cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients in the study who got either the Moderna or Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccines within 100 days of beginning immunotherapy were more than &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; as likely to survive after three years as patients who didn't receive either jab. Further, patients whose tumors don't respond well to immunotherapy were &lt;em&gt;five times&lt;/em&gt; more likely to survive past three years if they had a Pfizer or Moderna mRNA COVID vaccine than patients who didn't get vaccinated. Finally, these results held up even when researchers factored in variables like co-morbidities, disease severity and patients' other medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uh, this is pretty huge, but what does it all actually mean in practice? We asked infectious disease experts and oncologists to explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/most-common-covid-symptoms-october-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Most Common COVID-19 Symptoms Doctors Are Seeing Right Now;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Most Common COVID-19 Symptoms Doctors Are Seeing Right Now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study opens an intriguing possibility: that modern mRNA vaccines—originally designed to prevent viral infections—may enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade," &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cancer.osu.edu/find-a-researcher/search-researcher-directory/zihai-li" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Zihai Li, MD., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Zihai Li, MD., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, founding director of&lt;br&gt;Pelotonia Institute for Immuno-Oncology, Klotz Memorial Chair in Cancer Research and professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine, explains. "In other words, receiving an mRNA vaccine around the time of immunotherapy could 'prime' the immune system to respond more vigorously against cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That surely sounds promising, but Dr. Li points out something significant in the research that's important to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The findings are most directly relevant to solid tumors such as lung cancer and melanoma, where they have the most data, and that checkpoint blockade is already a mainstay of treatment," he says. "However, much remains to be learned ... In patients, the only mRNA vaccines they looked at were mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV2. If confirmed, these findings could reshape how we integrate vaccines and immunotherapy, transforming preventive vaccines into therapeutic allies against cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all that said, please keep in mind that this isn't a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Current clinical guidelines, including those from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), do not recognize direct anti-cancer effects as a rationale for COVID-19 vaccination in cancer patients," &lt;a href="https://www.healthtrackrx.com/for-practitioners/meet-steven-goldberg-md-mba-chief-medical-officer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Steven Goldberg, MD, MBA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Steven Goldberg, MD, MBA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chief medical officer at HealthTrackRx, advises. "The primary benefit of COVID-19 vaccination in this population is the prevention of COVID-19 and its complications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/habit-that-makes-vaccines-less-effective-according-to-infectious-disease-experts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Surprising Habit Could Make Your Vaccine Less Effective;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Surprising Habit Could Make Your Vaccine Less Effective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can Other Vaccines Help Fight Cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed a lot of promise in terms of two specific types of mRNA COVID vaccines in the fight against certain cancers. Could other vaccines show that benefit too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to experts we spoke with, it's too soon to tell just yet. "We will have to study if other mRNA vaccines could have the same type of benefit, or if this is only seen in mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines," &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.texasoncology.com/oncologist/jeff-yorio" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Jeff Yorio, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Jeff Yorio, MD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, medical oncologist and research site leader at Texas Oncology, tells &lt;em&gt;Parade&lt;/em&gt;. "Pneumonia vaccines and flu vaccines, which are not mRNA-based, did not change the response to immunotherapy. This was a retrospective study so more work will need to be done to verify the results, but it is definitely a promising finding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study just looked at mRNA based COVID vaccines, but it did look at different manufacturers," &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://scholars.houstonmethodist.org/en/persons/s-wesley-long" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. S. Wesley Long, MD, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. S. Wesley Long, MD, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, associate professor of clinical pathology and genomic medicine at Houston Methodist, concurs. "We don’t yet know if the same benefits might extend to other mRNA vaccines, or vaccination in general."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, certain other vaccines have shown some efficacy in studies, according to Dr. Goldberg:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, for example, is an established immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and is known to induce 'trained immunity,' a process that enhances the responsiveness of the immune system to tumor cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccines such as HPV and hepatitis B are specifically designed to prevent virus-induced cancers, but COVID-19 vaccines are not in this category."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccines like influenza and pneumococcus have also been studied for their potential to modulate immune responses in cancer patients, but there is no consistent evidence that they directly inhibit tumor growth or metastasis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/when-to-see-doctor-vaccine-side-effects-according-to-infectious-disease-experts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:These Are the Vaccine Side Effects You Should Worry About, According to Infectious Disease Experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;These Are the Vaccine Side Effects You Should Worry About, According to Infectious Disease Experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Are Other Benefits of the COVID Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let us remind you: It is prime season for COVID, colds and flu. Protect yourself! "The best evidence supports that COVID-19 vaccination prevents severe disease, hospitalization and death," Dr. Long says. "It can also decrease your risk of developing long COVID, prevent infection and may reduce viral load by shortening the length of illness and symptoms if you are infected."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, just to reiterate one more time: No, the COVID vaccine doesn't &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; cancer, despite some non-science-backed conversations in the news right now. "So far, we have not seen any evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have caused an increase in cancer rates," Dr. Yorio says. "During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, there was a big drop in cancer incidence because people were not getting screened as frequently or going to doctors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was an expected rise in the next few years in cancer incidence due to the lack of diagnosis in 2020, he explains. "Again, this was not due to vaccines but rather a lack of testing during the pandemic. A study like this is actually showing a potential survival benefit to the COVID-19 vaccine in patients with advanced cancer. And, while there are patients who do have some side effects from vaccines, the COVID-19 vaccine is still thought to be a very safe vaccine overall."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/one-thing-heart-health-according-to-cardiologists-fall-2024" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: The One Thing Cardiologists Are Begging You to Do for Your Heart Health This Fall and Winter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: The One Thing Cardiologists Are Begging You to Do for Your Heart Health This Fall and Winter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthtrackrx.com/for-practitioners/meet-steven-goldberg-md-mba-chief-medical-officer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Steven Goldberg, MD, MBA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Steven Goldberg, MD, MBA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cancer.osu.edu/find-a-researcher/search-researcher-directory/zihai-li" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Zihai Li, MD., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Zihai Li, MD., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scholars.houstonmethodist.org/en/persons/s-wesley-long" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. S.

		&lt;p&gt;Drug overdose deaths in Maine have fallen by 23% so far in 2025, continuing a trend of declining fatal overdoses over the last three years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maine recorded 292 overdose deaths from January through September of this year, compared to 379 deaths during the &lt;a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2025/05/15/overdose-deaths-declined-in-maine-last-year-but-not-as-sharply-as-the-u-s-overall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;same period in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, according to state data released late last week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-flourish wp-block-embed-flourish"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gordon Smith, director of opioid response for Gov. Janet Mills’ administration, said a number of factors are contributing to the positive trend, including opioids coming into the U.S. that have lower concentrations of fentanyl, expanding prevention programs and greater use of naloxone, an opioid antidote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve come a long way,” Smith said. “You can’t point to one thing. It’s an accumulation of all of our strategies: Prevention, harm reduction, treatment and recovery support.”&lt;/p&gt;


	
	


&lt;p&gt;Maine peaked at 723 overdose deaths in 2022, after a decade’s worth of steady increases nearly every year. Since then, overdose deaths have fallen, to 607 in 2023 and 490 in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If current the trend continues, &lt;a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2025/07/01/evidence-based-drug-policy-is-reducing-maine-overdose-deaths-trumps-budget-could-destroy-it-opinion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Maine would end 2025&lt;/a&gt; with fewer than 400 fatal overdoses, the fewest in six years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nonfatal overdoses are also down 11.2% from January to September in 2025, compared to the same period in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maine’s decline in overdose deaths since 2023 has mirrored national trends. According to the most recent data available, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a 24.5% decrease in fatal drug deaths from April 2024 to April 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

(Derek Davis/Staff Photographer)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Smith said that in Maine treatment is far more available — in one example, the state has 100 detox beds compared to 20 only five years ago — and the state does a better job of connecting people with substance use disorder to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said the state’s OPTIONS program — Overdose Prevention Through Intensive Outreach, Naloxone and Safety — has placed liaisons in all 16 counties whose job it is to reach out to people who have survived overdoses and connect them to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think that it makes quite a difference,” he said. “Otherwise there’s a strong likelihood they’re going to overdose again.”‘&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Smith said expansion of treatment in jails has also helped, as one of the most vulnerable times for a person to overdose is when they’re being released from jail because their tolerance to substances is weakened.&lt;/p&gt;


	
	


&lt;p&gt;Dr. Noah Nesin, an opioid treatment expert and medical director of Community Care Partnership of Maine in Bangor, said years of lower rates of prescribing opioids, at reduced doses, has helped prevent people from acquiring substance use disorder that started from a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maine has one of the strictest &lt;a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2018/04/19/opioid-prescribing-in-maine-falls-12-under-strict-new-prescribing-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;opioid prescribing regulations in the nation&lt;/a&gt;, a reform passed in 2016 during Gov. Paul LePage’s administration. Morphine milligram equivalents — one metric used to measure opioid prescribing — has declined by more than half in the last decade, from 1.25 billion MMEs prescribed in 2015 to 473 million MMEs in 2024, according to state data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nesin said naloxone use is also a major factor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One reason we are seeing fewer fatal overdoses is how widely available naloxone is, and how completely it’s been taken up by the community who uses drugs, to save lives,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hospitals are getting better at treating people who have overdosed, and connecting people who overdosed to treatment after they are released from the hospital, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People have switched to other substances, too. &lt;a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2025/06/22/meth-is-showing-up-more-in-maine-but-its-complicated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Nesin said more people are using methamphetamine &lt;/a&gt;and cocaine, which are not typically as fatal as opioids like fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We certainly haven’t seen a decline in usage commensurate with how much overdose deaths have declined,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

The UK &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, houses retinal and health data from more than 500,000 volunteers, giving scientists an unprecedented window into how subtle eye features mirror the body’s overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-oculomics-the-basics"&gt;Understanding oculomics – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting-edge technology used in the nascent field of oculomics allows scientists and doctors to uncover signs of heart disease, diabetes, kidney issues, and even neurological disorders – all from a quick, noninvasive eye scan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-that-the-eyes-retina-can-reconnect-itself-to-maintain-vision/"&gt;human retina&lt;/a&gt; is an extension of the brain and shares blood vessels with other vital organs. This means tiny changes in the retina’s structure or color can signal bigger problems elsewhere in the body, long before symptoms appear elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced AI algorithms analyze high-resolution images of the retina, optic nerve, and blood vessels to detect patterns far too subtle for the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-eyes-retina-sync-everything-they-see-before-sending-visual-signals-to-the-brain/"&gt;human eye&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These AI systems can measure vessel width, nerve fiber thickness, pigmentation, and even microstructural changes in the retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining ocular data with genetic, lifestyle, and clinical information, AI used in oculomics can create what researchers call a “digital eyeprint” – a personal health signature that reflects how well your body is functioning as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-retinal-link-to-systemic-disease"&gt;Retinal link to systemic disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Dr. Tien Yin Wong at the &lt;a href="https://www.snec.com.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Singapore National Eye Centre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.snec.com.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Duke NUS Medical School&lt;/a&gt; (SNEC). His research centers on retinal imaging, artificial intelligence, and how ocular clues relate to systemic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retina, a thin light-sensing layer at the back of the eye, exposes tiny blood vessels and nerve tissue with uncommon clarity. Those are two organ systems that usually cannot be examined directly without surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oculomics connects small changes in retinal structure and blood flow to patterns seen in the heart, brain, and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-oculomics-and-ai"&gt;Oculomics and AI&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deep-learning study trained on 284,335 patients showed that retinal photographs can estimate common risk factors such as age and smoking status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also predicted the likelihood of a major cardiac event within five years – with performance comparable to standard calculators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientific-discoveries-machine-learning/"&gt;Deep learning&lt;/a&gt;, a machine-learning method that identifies patterns from large datasets, excels at finding subtle image features that humans miss. It weighs vessel width, twists, and textures, then converts them into a composite risk score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-clues-in-every-eye-photo"&gt;Health clues in every eye photo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multi-country system used retinal photos to estimate &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-health-after-menopause-what-every-woman-should-know/"&gt;coronary artery calcium&lt;/a&gt; – calcium buildup in heart arteries that indicates plaque burden – and stratified cardiovascular risk without a CT scan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach offered a low-cost, noninvasive way to identify who might need more intensive testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate algorithm detected &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-blood-test-identifies-early-stage-alzheimers-with-90-percent-accuracy/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; from retinal photographs in a multicenter sample. The model captured disease-linked features in the macula and microvasculature while standardizing results across sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another team reported a retinal age-gap biomarker that correlated with mortality risk. When the predicted retinal age exceeded a person’s actual age, risk increased modestly but consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-joins-primary-care"&gt;AI joins primary care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today’s decision permits the marketing of a novel artificial intelligence technology that can be used in a primary care doctor’s office,” said Dr. Malvina Eydelman, an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; device director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators have started to permit autonomous tools that interpret retinal images in primary care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That early green light focused on diabetic retinopathy, but it set a clear precedent. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-imaging-traces-humans-view/"&gt;Autonomous AI&lt;/a&gt;, software that can make a clinical call without human oversight, could triage patients where specialists are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-oculomics-still-has-limitations"&gt;Oculomics still has limitations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clearest successes so far lie in high-burden conditions with well-defined biological signatures in the eye. Heart risk, cognitive decline, diabetes, and kidney stress all leave detectable traces in vessel shape or retinal layers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limits still matter. Generalizability – the ability of a model to perform reliably across new clinics and populations – can falter when cameras, image quality, or patient backgrounds differ from the training data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians should treat oculomics outputs like any other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/100-year-old-people-all-share-these-crucial-blood-biomarkers-that-short-lived-people-dont-have/"&gt;biomarker&lt;/a&gt;, a measurable signal that reflects disease risk. A positive result may prompt follow-up tests, not an instant diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;False alarms and misses will happen, especially at the edges. That is why teams are validating models prospectively, recalibrating thresholds, and combining image signals with routine vitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eyes-as-health-sensors"&gt;Eyes as health sensors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-tissue-spinach-leaves/"&gt;microvasculature&lt;/a&gt; – the body’s smallest blood vessels that carry oxygen – is visible in every retinal image, offering a clear snapshot of vascular health throughout the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern cameras now make that window easy to access: a 30-second, noninvasive photo can be taken in a primary care clinic, a pharmacy, or even by mobile teams during community screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portable imaging systems and home-based vision tools are extending that reach even further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As datasets expand, foundation models – large pre-trained AI systems that can adapt to many tasks – are expected to improve stability and reduce the need for manual labeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the goal is precision prevention. By translating subtle eye signals into actionable health insights, oculomics could help match each patient to the right “next step,” whether that means starting a statin, investigating cognitive decline, or tightening glucose control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946225000230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Progress in Retinal and Eye Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 22:15:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxOSTByRFlkTzVHMzNXTVFRRzFsTTNVeWp3QVQ0SjJPMzIxWjltazZ2SHhFUUYxTzNsRHhKdVhCODgweUh1RVZ1MWdHdzlqb2FuVVlLS2tHUUlDQmY3cDRzVzdQTXY1WmpiYl9tMzdkWFFCMzRCWHpOUTl4bG03MFZwRF91ZGxlMzJvVjZqcUt0UGNvZWNQZnZIeElIcEphMGRBcTZiWkFvbDRSTjFMdXNPYmFJdlY5MnM</guid></item><item><title>加拿大战胜了麻疹和麻疹；病毒在1998年消除后流行- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/canada-fought-measles-and-measles-won-virus-now-endemic-after-1998-elimination/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;“This loss represents a setback, of course, but it is also reversible,” Jarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said in a press briefing Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Call to action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbosa was optimistic that Canada could regain its elimination status. He highlighted that such setbacks have happened before. “In 2018 and 2019, Venezuela and Brazil temporarily lost their elimination status following large outbreaks,” Barbosa noted. “Thanks to coordinated action by governments, civil society, and regional cooperation, those outbreaks were contained, and the Region of the Americas regained its measles-free status in 2024.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday&lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2025/11/statement-from-the-public-health-agency-of-canada-on-canadas-measles-elimination-status.html"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2025/11/statement-from-the-public-health-agency-of-canada-on-canadas-measles-elimination-status.html"&gt;the Public Health Agency of Canada released a statement&lt;/a&gt; confirming that it received notification from PAHO that it had lost its measles elimination status, while reporting that it is already getting to work on earning it back. “PHAC is collaborating with the PAHO and working with federal, provincial, territorial, and community partners to implement coordinated actions—focused on improving vaccination coverage, strengthening data sharing, enabling better overall surveillance efforts, and providing evidence-based guidance,” the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Canada isn’t the only country facing an uphill battle against measles—the most infectious virus known to humankind. Outbreaks and sustained spread are also active in the US and Mexico. To date, the US has documented at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;1,618 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; since the start of the year, while Mexico has tallied at least &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/1036453/INFORME_DIARIO_SARAMPION_20251107.pdf"&gt;5,185&lt;/a&gt;. Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Belize also have ongoing outbreaks, PAHO reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of November 7, PAHO has collected reports of 12,593 confirmed measles cases from 10 countries, but approximately 95 percent of them are in Canada, Mexico, and the US. That total is a 30-fold increase compared to 2024, PAHO notes, and the rise has led to at least 28 deaths: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PAHO used Canada’s loss as a call to action not just in the northern country, but the rest of the region. “Every case we prevent, every outbreak we stop saves lives, protects families, and makes communities healthier,” Barbosa said. “Today, rather than lamenting the loss of a regional status, we call on all countries to redouble their efforts to strengthen vaccination rates, surveillance, and timely response to suspected cases—reaching every corner of the Americas. As a Region, we have eliminated measles twice. We can do it a third time.”&lt;/p&gt;

It is earned when a country shows it stopped continuous spread of the virus within local communities, though occasional cases might still pop up from travel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/general-news-fe39445a21d4482680bcf2b0dc656ae8"&gt;typically begins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a high fever followed by a telltale rash that starts on the face and neck. Most people recover, but it’s one of the leading causes of death among young children, according to the World Health Organization. Serious complications, including blindness and swelling of the brain, are more common in young children and adults over age 30. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;It is prevented by a vaccine administered routinely and safely to children around the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a deeply disheartening development. It’s a deeply worrisome development. And, frankly, it’s an embarrassing development,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University infectious disease expert. “No country with the amount of resources of Canada — or other countries in North America even — should lose their measles elimination status.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Vaccination campaigns led to elimination&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada eliminated measles in 1998, followed by the United States two years later. After hugely successful &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-measles-polio-whooping-cough-rubella-af4cd1aef8f408a960601df6372f9c32"&gt;vaccination campaigns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the Americas became the first region in the world to be free of measles in 2016. Health officials estimate the measles vaccine prevented &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.paho.org/en/topics/measles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;6.2 millions deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the Americas between 2000 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vaccination rates have since slipped below the 95% coverage rate needed to stop outbreaks. Large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019 cost the region its elimination status. It was reclaimed in 2024, but ends again with Canada’s loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts from the Pan American Health Organization, an independent health agency, made the determination after analyzing data on Canada’s outbreaks that showed the virus has spread continuously for a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has never been easy to stop measles from circulating in local communities, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization, said in a briefing Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a region, we have eliminated measles twice,” Barbosa said. “We can do it a third time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Canadian health officials said they were working with government and community partners to improve vaccination coverage, share data and provide evidence-based guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus is one of the most contagious known to medicine. One infected person can spread it to up to 9 out of 10 unprotected people they come into close contact with. Health experts say, by far, the best prevention against measles is the vaccine, which provides 97% protection after two doses.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Barbosa’s organization has confirmed nearly 12,600 cases this year across 10 countries, a 30-fold increase from 2024. The vast majority are in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, but Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Belize also have active outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the region had a 79% vaccination rate, an increase from years past but still too low, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;United States could be next to lose status&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. eliminated measles in 2000. That status is at risk even though the large outbreak that &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-rfk-death-vaccine-4e28b0edf5cab47980b40b2d47f0ec50"&gt;killed three&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and sickened nearly 900 across &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-vaccine-outbreak-texas-mmr-0744a165cfb354022092a1f158c698b0"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-new-mexico-detention-facility-migrants-outbreak-c7f5897ebba85a59548d279c500adaea"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Oklahoma earlier this year is over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current outbreaks in the U.S. include 34 cases in South Carolina and one hitting towns on the Arizona-Utah border that has sickened more than 150 since mid-August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major question now is if either are linked to the Texas outbreak. To lose elimination status, health data must show a continuous chain of measles spread for one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International health officials have recommended the U.S. “enhance case investigation protocols,” because closing data gaps is key to stopping the virus from taking hold again, said Dr. Daniel Salas, who leads immunization efforts at the Pan American Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 1,681 cases and 44 outbreaks this year, making it the worst year for measles in the U.S. in more than three decades. Only nine states haven’t confirmed cases, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large outbreak also continues in Chihuahua, Mexico, where health officials have confirmed 4,430 cases as of last week and 21 deaths, according to state health data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexican and U.S. officials have said the genetic strains of measles spreading in Canada match those in the Texas and Chihuahua outbreaks. All those outbreaks affected certain Mennonite Christian communities who trace their migration over generations from &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-vaccinations-mennonites-4880035d6fd53cc029b531f5adda95ad"&gt;Canada to Mexico to Seminole, Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;In August, officials said Mennonite communities in Belize, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay had outbreaks of the same type of measles virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mennonite churches do not formally discourage vaccination, though &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c"&gt;more conservative Mennonite communities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; historically have low vaccination rates and a distrust of government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to look at the outbreaks in a vacuum, Nuzzo said. But many are likely linked, she said, not just by sick people traveling but also by anti-vaccine disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a religious prohibition in most of these cases,” she said. “It is just people being, perhaps, distrustful of authorities, but also preyed upon by these anti-vaccine influencers who profit off of the fears that some people may have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    &lt;/b&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For more than two decades, the Food and Drug Administration has warned women about the potential risks of using estrogen to treat menopause symptoms. And that's because early studies showed an increased risk of endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disorders and breast cancer. Well, those warnings are going away, and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary led the way on that decision, and he's here with me in studio now. Thanks for coming by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARTY MAKARY: Great to be with you, Juana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: So, I mean, this black box warning that we're talking about, it's been in place on all estrogen treatments for more than two decades, since back in 2003. The timing - why remove it now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Well, the fear machine did start in 2003, after a 2002 study that really hit the airwaves in the media with a big splash, scaring women out of hormone replacement therapy in the postmenopausal setting. Up to 1 in 4 Americans were taking it. Women lived longer and felt better. But then it got deemed a carcinogen based on this study. It turns out when the study results were finally released after the media announcement, there was no statistically significant increased risk of breast cancer. There was a lower rate of breast cancer in the estrogen-only group. And so it ends up being very nuanced. And the cardiovascular benefits are profound when hormone replacement therapy is started within 10 years of the onset of menopause. So there is some nuance here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: But unfortunately, the fear machine has dominated the field, and women have been talked out of it. They've been denied or never offered hormone replacement therapy despite the profound short-term and long-term benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Well, let's talk about that for a second, because there is a lot of nuance here. Just spell out plainly for us some of the benefits of hormone therapy as you see them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Yeah. So starting hormone replacement therapy around the time of menopause not only can alleviate the short-term symptoms of menopause - that is the hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, weight gain, difficulty sleeping...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: ...Pain with sexual activity. There are 50-plus different symptoms, and every woman experiences them differently. You know, we were taught at medical school that some women have symptoms, but they're usually mild and last just a couple years - not true. Eighty-plus percent of women have symptoms. The average duration is eight years, and for many women, it is severe. They are debilitating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-term benefits are remarkable and massively misunderstood. It reduces the risk of bone fractures later in life by 50- to 60%. That's a New England Journal study. It reduces cognitive decline by up to 64%. In one study, reduced the risk of Alzheimer's by 35%, and there are cardiovascular benefits when it's started within 10 years of the onset of menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Does it matter if a woman is taking a pill, which is systemic, or using a cream, which is a local treatment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: So there are pills. There are patches. There are creams and gels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: And so all of these products had a black box warning from the FDA as a part of this pile-on, as a part of this bandwagon thinking in 2002, 2003. We are removing those and putting the nuances of the risks in the package insert. And the idea is to get better information in front of women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Spell out some of these risks for us, because there are still risks associated with hormone replacement therapy, is that right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Yeah. When started more than 10 years after the onset of menopause, then you actually see some of these risks that are - have been attributed to all hormone replacement therapy products. And that's probably because the body naturally is making estrogen, and that increases nitric oxide. It keeps the blood vessels soft and the walls soft and healthy and dilated. And so when it started such that there's not a gap where your body is without it, then there are cardiovascular benefits where the reduction in heart disease has been noted to be 35 - 30- to 50%. That is a 30- to 50% reduction in heart disease, and in a study in circulation two years ago, a 48% decline in heart attack deaths. And so that is because of the effect of estrogen. So if it's started too late, the blood vessels are narrowing and the theory is that they're hardening and that aging and atherosclerosis can then result in a situation that is prone for a blood clot...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: ...With hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Commissioner, are there women who should not be using hormone therapy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Yes. Many doctors do identify some contraindications - a woman with an underlying risk for blood clots, a woman with active breast cancer or past breast cancer, depending on the practice style of the physician. But the vast majority of women who go through menopause, which is about 2 million women a year, are great candidates for hormone replacement therapy. If a woman has a uterus, it's important for them to also take progesterone to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and possibly uterine cancer. But women who have been taking this for a long time have reported tremendous benefits, and they're talking about it on social media now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: So there is a bit of an awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: I do want to ask you about the process here. Because in preparing to remove the black box warning, there's usually a formal, very detailed process. Things seemed to play out differently this time. Tell us why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Yeah. We're getting things done. In this administration, at the FDA, we're getting things done. They were talking about removing or banning a food dye for 35 years before I got to the FDA. Within weeks, we took action to remove nine petroleum-based food dyes from the food supply. That's all artificial dyes. In this case, we are responding to a petition that was filed in 2016. It was basically blown off. It was refiled in 2025. We held an expert panel. We didn't go through the long, bureaucratic, expensive process of bringing in conflicted experts to talk about a product. We brought in a range of diverse medical experts who passionately made the case for stopping this fear machine by removing the black box warnings around cardiovascular disease, dementia and breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: I mean, over the last several years in our society, I don't have to tell you this, but there has been this increasing recognition of the health challenges, the very real challenges that women face during menopause, and you and I were talking about the nuance in this conversation earlier. Do you worry at all that by removing this black box warning, that it might result in the pendulum tipping the other way, and there's now going to be an overuse of hormone therapy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Well, tragically, over the last 23 years, 50 million women have been denied or talked out of hormone replacement therapy in part because of the fear machine that it - hormone replacement therapy is a carcinogen, it causes breast cancer. We can argue whether or not the old type of progesterone used, called MPA, in that original study may have slightly increased the risk of breast cancer in women who took that MPA. But no clinical trial has ever found that it increases the risk of breast cancer mortality. And if it did, that harm would be far eclipsed by the profound cardiovascular benefits. You know, early on in the 1920s, Mayo Clinic researchers noted that young girls who had their ovaries removed went on to have heart disease in their 30s and 40s, suggesting a profound cardiovascular protective effect. And so that's the nuance conversation that people need to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMERS: We've been speaking with FDA commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, coming in to talk to us about the FDA's decision to remove black box warnings for estrogen treatments for menopause. Thank you so much for coming by our studios today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKARY: Great to be with you, Juana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists have found enough evidence to firmly say that short-term fasting does not cause a dip in mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="1.0"&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;The idea that fasting interferes with mental performance probably stems from how we feel when hungry—tired, distracted, and irritable,” explains &lt;a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/d-moreau" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/d-moreau" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="David Moreau, PhD" data-node-id="1.2" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;David Moreau, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor in the School of Psychology at the University of Auckland in New Zealand and coauthor of the study. “It’s natural to assume that those sensations reflect poorer cognitive function. Some early studies supported this view, but when you pool the evidence, those effects largely disappear.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;This might sound like great news if you’ve been curious about intermittent fasting, but was nervous about it giving you &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a65372839/is-it-brain-fogor-something-else/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a65372839/is-it-brain-fogor-something-else/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="brain fog" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;brain fog&lt;/a&gt;. But not all fasting is created equal. There's a difference in how the &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a69110713/brain-creates-reality-illusion/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a69110713/brain-creates-reality-illusion/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="brain" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; operates on a short-term versus long-term fast.

They compared their cognitive performance, including memory recall, decision-making, response time, and accuracy. Most of the fasting periods were short-term, lasting on average around 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;After crunching the data, the researchers discovered no meaningful difference in cognition in people who did short-term fasts and those who recently ate. “The brain has built-in mechanisms to stay fueled and functional, even in the absence of food—a reassuring message for anyone who practices intermittent fasting,” Moreau says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Now this wasn't the case for people who did longer fasts that lasted over 12 hours. For this group, the researchers found small dips in their cognitive performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Fasts that last longer than 24 hours may negatively affect cognitive performance,” adds &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sonya Angelone, PhD, RDN" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Sonya Angelone, PhD, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, consulting nutritionist and former spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. But, like the study showed, Angelone says short-term intermittent fasting can be safe mentally for most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="but-what-if-you-do-feel-unfocused-when-fasting" data-node-id="9" class="body-h2 css-1ju5ws3 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="9.0"&gt;But What if You &lt;em data-node-id="9.0.1"&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="9.0.2"&gt;o&lt;/em&gt; Feel Unfocused When Fasting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Now the study showed no actual difference in cognitive performance in people &lt;em data-node-id="10.1"&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to short-term fasting. But if you're just starting out, your body needs time to adapt. &lt;a href="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS" data-node-id="10.3" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and co-founder of SoHo Strength Lab, says it could be one reason why you might feel mentally off when you first start fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“It’s harder for people who never fast,” he explains. “If you don’t eat and you usually eat on a consistent schedule, you might be very hungry—that’s mentally distracting.” People with metabolic conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a63333087/thriving-with-diabetes-cgm-marathon-long-bike-abe-ngoma/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a63333087/thriving-with-diabetes-cgm-marathon-long-bike-abe-ngoma/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="diabetes" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; may find that intermittent fasting impacts their cognition, too, Moreau says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="so-how-does-fasting-affect-the-brain" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1ju5ws3 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;So How Does Fasting Affect the Brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Fasting does impact your brain—just not in your cognitive abilities (which is how you think, learn, remember, and judge things). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Under normal eating conditions, Moreau says it mainly relies on glucose stored as glycogen. Cue fasting. When you skip a meal, you lose that source of fuel. However, Moreau says the brain is "remarkably adaptable" and has a backup plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“When glycogen levels fall during fasting, the body begins converting fat into ketone bodies, which the brain can use as an efficient alternative fuel," he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Your brain metabolism is prioritized over other parts of your body so, if you fast, your brain gets fed before your muscles," adds &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clifford Segil, DO" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center. And that's what allows your cognition to stay steady over short-term fasting, he says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;This flexibility helps ensure that your brain gets a steady energy supply, even when food is scarce, Moreau says. “In evolutionary terms, it makes sense: Our ancestors needed to stay alert and think clearly while seeking food, not become sluggish when hungry,” he says. “That capacity for cognitive stability likely persists today.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-cmvt2k ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

			&lt;p&gt;A common type of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus_infection"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt; (HPV) could be more dangerous than we thought. The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="180861" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;, known as beta-HPV, was thought in rare cases to contribute to skin  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="180861" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; by worsening UV damage, but a recent study suggests it can actually hijack the body's cells to directly drive cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fresh conclusions came from a study of a 34-year-old woman who sought medical help for &lt;a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma"&gt;cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt; (cSCC) on her forehead. Her tumors were repeatedly growing back, even after immunotherapy and surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/modified-herpes-virus-found-to-shrink-deadly-skin-cancers-in-clinical-trial"&gt;Modified Herpes Virus Found to Shrink Deadly Skin Cancers in Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A closer genetic analysis revealed something surprising: the beta-HPV had actually integrated itself into the DNA of the woman's tumor, where it was producing viral proteins that helped the cancer thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before now, beta-HPV had never been found to integrate into cellular DNA, let alone actively maintain a cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It suggests that there may be more people out there with aggressive forms of cSCC who have an underlying immune defect and could benefit from treatments targeting the immune system," &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/beta-hpv-can-directly-cause-skin-cancer-immunocompromised-people"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; immunologist Andrea Lisco from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman who was the subject of this study had an inherited immune disorder, one that prevented her &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"&gt;T cells&lt;/a&gt; from attacking HPV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169952" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169952" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart.jpg" alt="ZAP70 proteins" class="wp-image-169952 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart-600x349.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169952" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Issues with the ZAP70 protein were key to the research. (Ye et al., &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While tests revealed that the woman's immune system could still repair DNA damage from UV radiation – the typical cause of cSCC – the impairment of her T cells meant the beta-HPV could invade her skin cells and trigger the formation of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T&lt;span&gt;he immunocompromised woman was also being treated for other HPV-related illnesses, including warts on the skin and in the mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the cause of her condition was discovered, the patient received a bone marrow &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/stem-cell-transplant"&gt;stem cell transplant&lt;/a&gt; to replace her dysfunctional T cells with healthy ones. This cleared up the aggressive skin cancer and her other HPV-caused issues, none of which returned during a three-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery and successful outcome would not have been possible without the combined expertise of virologists, immunologists, oncologists, and transplant specialists, all working under the same roof," &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/beta-hpv-can-directly-cause-skin-cancer-immunocompromised-people"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study by no means minimizes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sunlight-can-still-damage-skin-through-a-closed-window-heres-how"&gt;the role of UV radiation&lt;/a&gt; as a cause of skin cancer, but it also shows that other factors are at work.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, affects nearly 40 million individuals globally, resulting in a gradual loss of memory and independence. Despite extensive research over the past decades, no treatments have been found that can halt or reverse the progression of this devastating disease.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         
										    


                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In AD, a major contributor to neuronal dysfunction is the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/protein+tau/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;protein tau&lt;/a&gt;. Tau typically plays a crucial role in keeping the internal structure of neurons stable, much like train tracks help trains stay on course. However, in some diseases, tau undergoes abnormal modifications and starts to aggregate, disrupting this transport system, thus leading to neuronal damage and subsequent memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers has reported a new mechanism by which boosting the natural metabolite NAD⁺ can protect the brain from the degeneration associated with AD. Their paper, titled "NAD⁺ reverses Alzheimer's neurological deficits via regulating differential alternative RNA splicing of EVA1C," is &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ady9811" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is led by Associate Professor Evandro Fei Fang from the University of Oslo and Akershus University Hospital, Norway, in collaboration with Professor Oscar Junhong Luo from Jinan University, China, and Associate Professor Joana M. Silva from the University of Minho, Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How NAD⁺ supports brain health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAD⁺ (&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nicotinamide+adenine+dinucleotide/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide&lt;/a&gt;, oxidized form) is a vital metabolite involved in energy metabolism and neuronal resilience in the body. It normally declines with age and especially in various neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Preliminary studies have shown that supplementation with NAD⁺ precursors, such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nicotinamide+riboside/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nicotinamide riboside&lt;/a&gt; (NR) or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), can offer therapeutic benefits in AD animal models and early clinical trials. However, the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/molecular+mechanisms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; behind these benefits remain largely unclear," first author Alice Ruixue Ai says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study reveals that NAD⁺ works through a previously unidentified RNA-splicing pathway. This pathway is regulated by a protein called EVA1C, which plays an essential role in the process of RNA splicing. RNA splicing allows a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/single+gene/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;single gene&lt;/a&gt; to produce multiple isoforms of a protein, and one isoform may show distinctive effects from the other isoforms. Its dysregulation is one of the most recently acknowledged risk factors for AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that when NAD⁺ levels are increased, EVA1C helps correct mistakes in RNA splicing. This restoration process improves the function of hundreds of genes, many crucial for brain health, which can help reverse the neurodegenerative damage caused by tau.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Cross-species validation from worms to mice to the human brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the impact of this mechanism, the researchers used a comprehensive approach that included computer predictions and validation in different animal models, including worms, mice, as well as human brain samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They first identified age-related changes in RNA splicing in a specific type of worm. They found that adding NAD⁺ could correct the splicing issues caused by the toxic tau protein. In mice with tau-related mutations, NAD⁺ supplements improved RNA splicing, restored brain function, and enhanced memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Notably, we found when the EVA1C gene was knocked down, these benefits were lost, confirming that EVA1C is essential for NAD⁺-mediated neuroprotection," Associate Professor Evandro Fei Fang-Stavem says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aligned with these animal studies, EVA1C levels were significantly reduced in brain cells from people with early AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using AI to uncover the mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further investigate how EVA1C works, the team used an AI-driven platform to predict how proteins interact with one another, analyzing structural, sequential, and evolutionary data from millions of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis revealed that NAD⁺ promotes a specific form of EVA1C that efficiently binds to essential proteins, which are central to protein folding and clearance. This connection links metabolic homeostasis, RNA splicing processes and protein management, three processes that are critically impaired in AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Towards new Alzheimer's treatments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By establishing the connection between NAD⁺ and EVA1C, this study lays the groundwork for the development of new therapies and optimization of NAD⁺ augmentation strategies in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We propose that maintaining NAD⁺ levels could help preserve neuronal identity and delay &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;, paving the way for combination treatments to enhance RNA splicing," Ai says.&lt;/p&gt;

"In other words, receiving an mRNA vaccine around the time of immunotherapy could 'prime' the immune system to respond more vigorously against cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That surely sounds promising, but Dr. Li points out something significant in the research that's important to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The findings are most directly relevant to solid tumors such as lung cancer and melanoma, where they have the most data, and that checkpoint blockade is already a mainstay of treatment," he says. "However, much remains to be learned ... In patients, the only mRNA vaccines they looked at were mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV2. If confirmed, these findings could reshape how we integrate vaccines and immunotherapy, transforming preventive vaccines into therapeutic allies against cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With all that said, please keep in mind that this isn't a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Current clinical guidelines, including those from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), do not recognize direct anti-cancer effects as a rationale for COVID-19 vaccination in cancer patients," &lt;a href="https://www.healthtrackrx.com/for-practitioners/meet-steven-goldberg-md-mba-chief-medical-officer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Steven Goldberg, MD, MBA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Steven Goldberg, MD, MBA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chief medical officer at HealthTrackRx, advises.

Protect yourself! "The best evidence supports that COVID-19 vaccination prevents severe disease, hospitalization and death," Dr. Long says. "It can also decrease your risk of developing long COVID, prevent infection and may reduce viral load by shortening the length of illness and symptoms if you are infected."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, just to reiterate one more time: No, the COVID vaccine doesn't &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; cancer, despite some non-science-backed conversations in the news right now. "So far, we have not seen any evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have caused an increase in cancer rates," Dr. Yorio says. "During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, there was a big drop in cancer incidence because people were not getting screened as frequently or going to doctors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There was an expected rise in the next few years in cancer incidence due to the lack of diagnosis in 2020, he explains. "Again, this was not due to vaccines but rather a lack of testing during the pandemic. A study like this is actually showing a potential survival benefit to the COVID-19 vaccine in patients with advanced cancer. And, while there are patients who do have some side effects from vaccines, the COVID-19 vaccine is still thought to be a very safe vaccine overall."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/one-thing-cardiologists-begging-protect-112500338.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: The One Thing Cardiologists Are Begging You to Do for Your Heart Health This Fall and Winter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: The One Thing Cardiologists Are Begging You to Do for Your Heart Health This Fall and Winter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/surprising-covid-vaccine-side-effect-according-to-study-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Nov 10, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Health &amp;amp; Wellness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Health &amp;amp; Wellness&lt;/a&gt; section.

&lt;p&gt;SURGEONS from the UK and the US have performed what is thought to be the world’s first remote-controlled stroke surgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Operating from Dundee, Scotland, Dr Iris Grunwald performed a remote thrombectomy – the removal of a blood clot from a blocked artery or vein to restore blood flow  – on a human cadaver. &lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/div&gt;

		

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;figure id="attachment_15468289" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prof Iris Grunwald demonstrates the technology which she says now shows that a specialist doesn’t need to be in the same hospital, or even in the same country, to help you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: SWNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_15468290" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The specialist machine was developed by Lithuanian MedTech company Sentante&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: SWNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The professor was at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee operating a specialist machine developed by Lithuanian MedTech company Sentante, while the body she performed the surgery on was across the city at the university. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in Florida, Dr Ricardo Hanel used the robotic device to operate on the body from across the Atlantic Ocean, more than 4,000 miles away from Dundee. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thrombectomy dramatically improves a stroke patient’s life, but specialists able to perform the surgery are lacking in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Professor Grunwald said: “By the time patients reach a specialist centre, there’s often no brain left to save. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="outstream" class="nuk-ad-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Every six minute delay in receiving treatment equates to 1 per cent lesser chance of a good outcome. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For example, here in Dundee we’re covering the north of Scotland – so a patient coming from &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/sport/football/team/1922106/inverness/"&gt;Inverness&lt;/a&gt;, or one of the islands, would have a long distance to travel. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The answer lies in expanding expertise locally through cross-speciality training, or by using robotic &lt;span id="557226ff-09b6-4ef2-9f11-2df7a780d5c3" class="suggested-link"&gt;technology&lt;/span&gt;, such as Sentande, that lets experts operate remotely.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ischaemic strokes are medical emergencies, and according to the World Stroke Organisation they kill an estimated 3.3 million people annually.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Sentante said in Scotland, just 212 patients underwent a thrombectomy last year, representing 2.2 per cent of people who had an ischaemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To carry out the surgery, Sentante’s robot is connected to catheters and wires, a surgeon recreates the procedure using joysticks and the machine performs the same movements in real time. &lt;/p&gt;



		
						
						
		



&lt;p&gt;Edvardas Satkauskas, Sentante’s chief executive, said: “For an iscahemic stroke, the difference between walking out of hospital and a lifetime of disability can be just two to three hours. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Today, patients are often transported long distances to reach one of a limited number of thrombectomy centres. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With Sentante, the specialist comes to the patient over a secure network and performs the entire procedure remotely – with the same tactile feel and control they have at the bedside.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remote thrombectomies have previously been conducted on a silicon model – a 3D printed replica – and on an animal. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following this first procedure on a human body, the research team now hope to take part in clinical human trials &lt;span id="07093fe4-27a4-4985-854b-73827dcd0b91" class="suggested-link"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt; year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Professor Grunwald said: “This is undoubtedly one of the most exciting innovations in stroke intervention in the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure id="attachment_15468291" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A thrombectomy removes blood clots from a patient’s brain following a stroke and can greatly improve a patient’s quality of life – but specialists able to perform the surgery are lacking in the UK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: SWNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_15468292" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Professor Grunwald said: “This is undoubtedly one of the most exciting innovations in stroke intervention in the last decade.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: SWNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“What amazed me most was how tactile the experience was. My hands felt exactly as they usually would if I had been doing a conventional thrombectomy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Remote robotics has the &lt;span id="f30fb4b0-f62c-4e14-be36-bac695a647be" class="suggested-link"&gt;power&lt;/span&gt; to decouple expertise from geography. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our demonstration shows that a specialist can perform a technically demanding neurovascular intervention from thousands of miles away, perhaps even from their home. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was an honour to perform the first remote thrombectomy in a human body and to then be part of the team that delivered the first transatlantic thrombectomy.”&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p class="article-readmore__content-clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		


&lt;p&gt;Dr Hanel added: “Tele neurointervention will allow us to decrease the gap and further our reach to provide one of the most impactful procedures in humankind—the thrombectomy—to more people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To operate from the US to Scotland with a 120 millisecond (blink of an eye) lag is truly remarkable.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thrombectomy is a treatment for&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ischaemic stroke&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;that &lt;/span&gt;removes a blood clot from a blocked blood vessel in the brain&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;using a special device. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A wire is carefully inserted into a blood vessel in your groin and moves up to your brain to pull the clot out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This allows doctors to reach and remove clots that are too large to be broken down by clot-busting medication in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;thrombolysis&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="how"&gt;Thrombectomy should be carried out as soon as possible after a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="how"&gt;It is most effective when performed within the first few hours of symptoms starting, but can be done up to 24 hours after the stroke if doctors think it will benefit you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thrombectomy is performed in specialist stroke centres, usually in large hospitals with dedicated teams and equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some hospitals offer thrombectomy 24 hours a day, but not all areas in the UK have round-the-clock access yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your nearest hospital doesn’t provide thrombectomy, you may be transferred to a specialist centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There aren’t enough trained specialists yet for a 24/7 service across the UK, and specialist equipment is also needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More hospitals are working to provide this treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
