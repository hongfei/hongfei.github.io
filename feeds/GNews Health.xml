              &lt;p&gt;The old adage “ignorance is bliss” feels especially fitting when it comes to healthcare. In fact, new research reveals that one in three people avoids—or is likely to avoid—medical information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/abm/article/59/1/kaaf058/8229759?login=true"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the Annals of Behavioral Medicine earlier this month, researchers investigated data from 92 studies involving 564,497 participants from 25 countries. Despite the fact that successful treatment often depends on early detection, their results indicate that many people are reluctant to engage in preventive care or checkups. These first-of-their-kind global estimates carry significant implications for health policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Avoidance highest for Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Medical information is more accessible than ever, but many people choose to avoid it,” the researchers wrote in the study. “We found that nearly 1 in 3 people avoided or were likely to avoid medical information.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People were most likely to avoid information about incurable neurodegenerative diseases—41% for Alzheimer’s and 40% for Huntington’s. Avoidance dropped slightly for serious but treatable conditions like HIV (32%) and cancer (29%) and was lowest for chronic, manageable illnesses like diabetes, at 24%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers described medical information avoidance as “any behavior designed to prevent or delay the acquisition of available but potentially unwanted information,” such as delaying or missing doctor’s appointments and refusing medical tests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While one might suggest that a lack of information or high financial costs are to blame, the study includes Germany. There, health insurance companies communicate appropriate services to their members and usually cover the expenses. Unfortunately, however, the study did not allow for the direct comparisons of information avoidance between countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One possibility is that the choice not to know is a deliberate one,” Ralph Hertwig, co-author of the study and director of the Center for Adaptive Rationality at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, said in an institute &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/25246796/avoidance-of-information-about-own-health"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We have investigated this phenomenon—which we call deliberate ignorance—in other areas of life and found that there are a wide variety of reasons for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Why do people avoid information about their health?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team identified 16 key predictors of this avoidance. Interestingly, these did not include gender, race, or ethnicity. The most significant predictors were feeling overwhelmed, low confidence in managing one’s health, the fear of being judged, and mistrust and lack of confidence in the medical system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Patterns of avoidance varied across world regions, suggesting that differences in healthcare systems may influence behavior,” the researchers explained in the paper, adding that they did not investigate how medical information avoidance impacts patients’ health. “More research is needed to understand the psychological and medical consequences of avoiding medical information.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In fact, the team highlights that their research does not judge if medical information avoidance is positive or negative—it reveals that the behavior is common and not always irrational. Furthermore, the identified avoidance predictors highlight potential areas for policy interventions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, “our findings suggest that lower trust is associated with higher information avoidance,” lead study author Konstantin Offer, a predoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, said in the statement. “Restoring trust in the medical system could therefore lead to greater engagement with medical information.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In other words, if you dread attending checkups or learning your medical test results, you’re far from being the only one, since many people avoid it altogether. But it remains to be seen how this avoidance might impact people’s health.&lt;/p&gt;

The authors also looked for anti-aging effects of fatty acids, but that part of the study found “no significant effect.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The biggest discovery came when researchers saw that the chromosomes of people who took daily vitamin D3 pills appeared younger than those of the control group, said study author JoAnn Manson. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It was intriguing that we found that vitamin D supplementation did protect against a key pathway of biological aging,” said Manson, a medical professor at Harvard and Brigham and Women’s Hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Specifically, protective caps on the ends of chromosomes — which have long been known to shorten with age — measured longer at the end of the study in the vitamin D3 group, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916525002552?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916525002552?via%3Dihub"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The shortening of the protective caps, called telomeres, is an “aging biomarker” that signals someone is more prone to inflammation and disease, Manson said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Shorter telomeres lead the entire X-shaped chromosome to deteriorate with age, “which increases risks for chronic diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and overall mortality,” the study said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Michael Holick, a national expert on vitamin D, said the study’s findings are consistent with other research showing people with insufficient vitamin D3 levels are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, and even infectious diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“These data are very supportive of the fact that it definitely improves health outcomes,” said Holick, a professor at the Boston University School of Medicine who was not involved in the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;On average, study participants who took daily vitamin D3 for four years had telomere lengths consistent with only one year of aging&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;over that period, the study found. The telomeres of participants in the placebo group had average lengths consistent with four years of aging, scientists said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Over four years, there was protection against three years of biological aging through that pathway of telomere shortening, which was an intriguing finding,” Manson said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Importantly, the study findings do not trump what doctors and scientists have long told patients about naturally occurring forms of vitamin D, Manson said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Most importantly, we are recommending that people try to follow a healthy diet that’s high in fruits, vegetables, and whole foods, and really minimize processed and ultra-processed foods,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Vitamin D supplements will never outweigh the positive biological effects of healthy diet and exercise regimens, which provide the human body with sufficient vitamin D, Manson said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We do believe that a healthy diet healthy lifestyle are paramount and will never be replaced by popping any pill,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Still, the study findings are important because they provide some proof that supplementing vitamin D intake in the winter months can have benefits at the cellular level, Manson said. People who have chronic conditions that prevent them from eating certain vitamin D-rich foods can also use vitamin D pills to effectively fill a nutritional gap, she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s quite reasonable, as a form of insurance to take 1,000 to 2,000 IUs a day if you have concerns about getting adequate intake from the diet or time spent outdoors,” Manson said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Holick, who is known for discovering the major form of vitamin D that circulates in human blood, said he recommends his patients take at least 2,000 IUs of vitamin D3 daily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The data is very clear — if you are vitamin D deficient, you’re at more increased risk of mortality,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

&lt;/figcaption&gt;  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., more than 38 million Americans have diabetes (about 1 in 10), of which some 90–95 percent have type 2, in which the body either can't use insulin effectively, or does not produce enough of it to regulate blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecnoglutide—which is not yet licensed—and dulaglutide both help manage blood sugar levels by acting on the same receptor in the body, known as the GLP-1 receptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecnoglutide targets specific pathways in the body that enhance insulin production and lower blood sugar, while avoiding another pathway that can sometimes reduce the receptor's activity, the researchers explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dulaglutide, on the other hand, turns on both pathways the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ecnoglutide demonstrates a better efficacy of weight loss and blood sugar control compared to existing medications in the trials," study author Feifei Jiang told &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 52-week study of more than 600 adults in China with type 2 diabetes, participants who received ecnoglutide saw their average blood sugar drop by about 1.9 percent, compared to a 1.65 percent drop in participants who received dulaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People taking ecnoglutide also lost nearly twice as much weight as those on dulaglutide, experiencing an average body weight reduction of 5.2–5.7 percent compared to an average weight loss of 2.8 percent for those taking dulaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The additional weight loss seen in participants taking ecnoglutide could further help diabetes management and reduce risks of heart disease, according to the authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on currently available information (primarily from clinical trials), the types of side effects associated with ecnoglutide are expected to be similar to those of existing GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as semaglutide or dulaglutide), primarily including gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) and decreased appetite. Most cases were mild to moderate side effects and tended to decrease gradually with prolonged treatment," Jiang explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecnoglutide is also simpler to produce than other GLP-1 receptor agonists, the study highlights. This means it can be manufactured more quickly and at a lower cost than other weight loss medications currently available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests ecnoglutide could be a valuable new treatment option for people with type 2 diabetes, offering effective blood sugar control and weight loss, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;figure class="block block-ibtg-article fA" data-gtm-category="Related In-Text A" data-gtm-action="Click"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of how it comparises to Ozempic, the researchers wrote in the paper: "Ecnoglutide, a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist, is composed entirely of natural amino acids with chemical modifications to enhance stability and activity, differing from semaglutide by four amino acids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They explained these modifications not only improve how the drug works but the manufacturing process in this case too. Unlike semaglutide, which requires extra chemical steps to attach additional amino acids, ecnoglutide can be made more directly through genetically engineered cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although this study presents a valuable comparison of ecnoglutide with dulaglutide, comparisons with semaglutide are also of clinical interest due to the structural similarity between ecnoglutide and semaglutide, and the greater glycemic and weight-lowering effects reported with semaglutide versus dulaglutide," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, at the time of study conduct, limited availability of semaglutide in China made its inclusion as a comparator unfeasible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the researchers said side-by-side consideration with the Phase &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33074557/" target="_blank" title="3 SUSTAIN-China study" class="multivariate"&gt;3 SUSTAIN-China study&lt;/a&gt; of semaglutide might offer some insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although no direct comparison has been conducted, these findings indirectly suggest that their efficacy might be similar. Future head-to-head trials will be required to confirm this," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiang explained that SUSTAIN-China showed average blood sugar was reduced by 1.4 percent to 1.7 percent with semaglutide after 30 weeks, whereas with ecnoglutide it dropped by 1.89 percent to 1.91 percent after 32 weeks (shown in the separate study).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, body weight was reduced by 5.2 percent to 5.7 percent with ecnoglutide after 52 weeks, while it was reduced by 3.9 percent to 5.7 percent with semaglutide after 30 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those results suggest that the efficacy of ecnoglutide might be similar or even better than semaglutide in glycemic control," Jiang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies are needed to explore ecnoglutide's efficacy across diverse populations and in combination with other antidiabetic agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ecnoglutide has not yet received formal marketing authorization for any indication in any country or region worldwide, in China, new drug applications (NDAs) are under review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ecnoglutide is expected to achieve optimal efficacy when combined with behavioral and lifestyle support interventions. Lifestyle guidance like dietary planning and exercise recommendations helps patients establish sustainable healthy habits," said Jiang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a tip on a health story that &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; should be covering?

Morten Harket (right) from the Norwegian group A-ha recently announced his diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For too long, Parkinson's has been fundamentally misunderstood,' they said. 'The majority of the public, and even many scientists, still view the disease as an inevitable consequence of aging. In their eyes, the disease reflects increasing longevity and the unfortunate consequence of genetics. They are mistaken.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors identify the research that has established the more likely cause of the rise in Parkinson's: the pesticides in our food and farms, the industrial toxins in the water we drink and the hidden particles in the air we breathe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Armed with that knowledge, they say, a few simple lifestyle changes - from using water and air filters to rolling up your car windows in traffic - can reduce exposure and actually prevent the onset of Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believe their recommendations can even be effective with people who have a family history of the disease, and those who have already started to show symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is never too late to get started,' they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We take a lesson from smoking. For smokers, cessation helps all regardless of age, and the benefits accrue fast - 20 minutes after the last cigarette smoked, an individual's heart rate returns to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Linda Ronstadt (pictured) lives with the rare brain disorder progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Research shows that the more likely cause of the recent rise in Parkinson's includes the industrial toxins pumped into the air&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Both Dr Okun (left) and Dr Dorsey (right) have spent their professional lives studying brain diseases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A day later, the risk of heart attack lowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By nine months, coughing is reduced, and a decade later, the risk of lung cancer is halved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The same could be true for environmental toxicants and Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Let's stop waiting passively for Parkinson's to surface. Let's apply what we have learned and begin preventing the disease now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Below are five of their 25 steps to prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Wash your produce (even if it's organic)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pesticides have made their way into our food supply. In 2024, Consumer Reports found that remnants of pesticides posed a significant health risk in 20 percent of common foods that it examined, including blueberries, bell peppers and potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Purchasing organic produce, dairy products and meat can all help reduce exposure. However, even organic produce can have unsafe pesticide residues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regardless of whether you buy organic or conventional fruits and vegetables, wash them. Use water and possibly a vegetable wash, because, like dirt, many pesticides do not dissolve in water. These washes are available in many grocery stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pesticides have made their way into our food supply - foods at particular risk include blueberries, bell peppers and potatoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Regardless of whether you buy organic or conventional fruits and vegetables, wash them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vinegar and salt solutions are good options too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To determine what levels of pesticides are safe, the US Department of Agriculture measures them after food has been washed with water for 15 to 20 seconds. If that is their practice, yours should be even longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another way to reduce your overall exposure to pesticides without buying entirely organic produce is to consult the reports of the Environmental Working Group, which lists foods with a lot of exposure (the Dirty Dozen) and those with much less (the Clean Fifteen). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another good way to learn what pesticides are being used is to go to a farmer's market or join a community-supported agricultural farm where you can speak to the farmers who grow the crops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Don't go to a grocery store near a dry cleaners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perchloroethylene (PCE), the dry-cleaning chemical, can readily spread beyond the walls of a dry cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PCE dissolves in fat. In Germany, the chemical has been found in dairy products at supermarkets near dry cleaners - the levels at those shops were two to 20 times the levels found in those farther away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Germany now prohibits supermarkets from being located close to dry cleaners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, next time you go shopping at your local market, look around at the neighboring businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Have a cup of coffee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has repeatedly demonstrated that caffeine consumption is associated with a decreased risk of Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine may protect the dopamine-producing nerve cells from the damage that results from exposure to toxicants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The benefits appear to be present regardless of your beverage of choice (coffee or tea) but are not present with decaffeinated drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, caffeine has its own health risks, such as spurring on anxiety and headaches. But thanks to the research, you now have another reason to enjoy your morning cup of joe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Exercise is the best tool we have in the neurodegeneration prevention tool kit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his best-selling book, Outlive, Dr Peter Attia wrote: 'I now tell patients that exercise is, full stop and hands down, the best tool we have in the neurodegeneration prevention tool kit.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise may improve the function of the mitochondria, the energy-producing parts of cells, that are damaged by toxicants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical activity also releases growth factors in the brain that protect nerve cells, including the dopamine-producing ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vigorous exercise can lower the risk of developing Parkinson's, and moving every day is also beneficial for those who already have the disease. A recent study found that six months of aerobic exercise (riding a stationary bike at least three times weekly, for example) reduced brain atrophy and slowed disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ask your favorite course or club what pesticides they use and when they spray&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Golf with caution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While no studies, to our knowledge, have examined rates of Parkinson's among avid golfers, one study in 1996 looked at the death certificates of golf course superintendents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that these workers who commonly use pesticides to keep golf courses weed-free had twice the risk of dying due to a nervous system disorder than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What are the 25 million golfers in the US and 67 million worldwide to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ask your favorite course or club what pesticides they use and when they spray, encourage them to use less, and have them consider safer alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the interim, avoid playing on courses just after they have been sprayed, and don't lick your golf ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The full list of 25 actions is published in The Parkinson's Plan: A New Path to Prevention and Treatment by Ray Dorsey MD and Michael S Okun MD, PublicAffairs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Here’s what you need to know, with expert insights from a doctor and two nutritionists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sonya Angelone, RDN,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sonya Angelone, RDN,&lt;/a&gt; a nutritionist and registered dietitian based in San Francisco; &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheng-Han Chen, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA; Christy Brissette, MS, RD, owner of &lt;a href="https://80twentynutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:80 Twenty Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;80 Twenty Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers recruited 39 people under the age of 30 as well as 36 people in their 60s and 70s, and had them go through two different two-week phases. In one phase, they consumed nitrate-rich beetroot juice (a.k.a. beet juice) daily. In the second phase, people consumed a placebo version of the drink with nitrates removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you’re not familiar with nitrates, they're compounds of &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/mn/what-nitrate" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nitrogen and oxygen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nitrogen and oxygen&lt;/a&gt; that occur naturally in the soil, water, vegetables, and processed meats. Nitrates in vegetables are converted to nitric oxide, which has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006295222004191" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-health benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart-health benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between the two phases, the participants had a two-week “wash out” period to reset their bodies. The researchers also used bacterial gene sequencing to find microbes that were in the participants’ mouths before and after each treatment phase. They took blood pressure readings, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers ultimately found that participants' oral microbiome changed dramatically after they consumed the nitrate-rich beet juice, but there were differences between the older and younger groups. The older group experienced a noticeable drop in the oral bacteria Prevotella after drinking beet juice, as well as an increase in good oral bacteria, like Neisseria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The older group initially had higher average blood pressure readings at the beginning of the study, but their blood pressure dropped after they had the nitrate-rich beetroot juice. (But not after they had the placebo drink.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do beets help lower blood pressure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first study to link beets to lower blood pressure. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8965354/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scientific analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;scientific analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in 2022 found that people saw an improvement in their blood pressure consuming 70 milliliters, 140 milliliters, and 250 milliliters (about a cup) of beet juice a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475324002369" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in 2024 found that there was a “significant effect” on systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) up to 90 days after participants had a daily dose of beet juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But…why? Well, it's a slightly complicated process. “Beets contain nitrates which are converted to nitrites by good bacteria in the mouth,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sonya Angelone, RDN,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sonya Angelone, RDN,&lt;/a&gt; a nutritionist and registered dietitian based in San Francisco. “The nitrites-rich saliva is swallowed, where it is converted to nitric oxide in the stomach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That nitric oxide is then absorbed into the bloodstream, where it helps blood vessels relax and widen, in a process called vasodilation, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheng-Han Chen, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA. "This process improves blood pressure," he says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria in your mouth matters, too. "Without the right balance of good bacteria in your mouth, the conversion of the nitrates in beets can’t happen, so you won't get the blood pressure-lowering effects from beets or beet root juice," says Christy Brissette, MS, RD, owner of &lt;a href="https://80twentynutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:80 Twenty Nutrition.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;80 Twenty Nutrition.&lt;/a&gt; "Eating a diet that is high in inorganic nitrates from beets and green leafy vegetables also seems to prevent the growth of unhealthy bacteria in the mouth, which could also help to lower blood pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other health benefits do beets have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beets actually have a lot going for them outside of blood pressure. They're also a good source of fiber "which is good for digestion and gut health,” Angelone says. And they contain antioxidants which can help reduce inflammation and lower your risk for chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only that, beets contain folate and potassium, which are good for heart health. “They may also support athletic performance by enhancing the mitochondrial function, the energy producing structure in the cells,” Angelone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much should I be eating to reap the benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the health benefits from beets, it’s good to eat about a cup of the veggie nearly every day, Angelone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you have high blood pressure, Brissette says it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider about the lifestyle moves you’re making to try to get that blood pressure back down. Also, keep in mind that beets or beet juice aren’t designed to replace any blood pressure-lowering medication you may be on—but they can support your efforts, per Dr. Chen. "The reductions in blood pressure are modest, but they are measurable," Dr. Chen adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more thing to point out: Beets aren't the only nitrate-rich veggie out there. So, if this vegetable isn't for you, consider loading up spinach, celery, and kale to reap similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBJRzlxVGtxSDNLdW1FMThJcUFCa3VoUG1kRkRzM1AtMXNhalFGSmF6djBIS3hMblpIalk5Q1RNaVdMQk85aFE0bVFqWGN5X1VJaHdjLWNLLWhmQm9qanBybnNmUl9WRlJ5VERTbjhQbmhwOGVD</guid></item><item><title>在大脑中，失去的肢体永远不会真正消失- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515601/brain-map-lost-limb-amputee-plasticity</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                A new study finds that the brain does not appear to significantly rewire its map of the body after an amputation.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A rare circulatory problem required Emily Wheldon to have her left arm amputated three years ago. Her brain still thinks it's there.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Most days, it just feels like I've got my arm next to me," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The perception is so compelling that Wheldon had to train herself not to rely on the missing limb.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When I first had the amputation," she says, "I was trying to put my arm out to stop myself from falling."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Now, a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02037-7" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of Wheldon and two other people with arm amputations may help explain why they are living with phantom limbs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brain scans showed that in all three, "the phantom hand representation is exactly similar to the pre-amputated hand representation," even five years after surgery, says &lt;a href="https://www.rnel.pitt.edu/people/hunter-schone-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Hunter Schone&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral associate at the University of Pittsburgh who started the project as a doctoral student at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The finding, which appears in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, challenges decades-old research in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1843843" target="_blank"&gt;monkeys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/375482a0" target="_blank"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that after losing sensory input from a limb, the brain dramatically reorganizes the areas linked to that limb.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I'm not sure the [new] study really negates that research," says &lt;a href="https://www.pennstatehealth.org/doctors/krishnankutty-sathian-mbbs-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Krish Sathian&lt;/a&gt;, the chair of neuroscience at Penn State Health, who was not involved in the research. "But the plot thickens, which is always the case in science."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sathian and Schone agree the finding bodes well for people who rely on a surgically implanted brain-computer interface to control a prosthetic or robotic limb. The interface depends on the brain maintaining for many years the circuits once used to move an arm, hand, or leg.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A brain map of the body&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The news study involved three people who knew they were going to have an amputation because of cancer or some other disease.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Researchers performed MRI scans before and after the amputation to look for changes in the &lt;a href="https://www.brainfacts.org/thinking-sensing-and-behaving/touch/2020/the-neuroscience-of-touch-and-pain-013020#:~:text=Sensations%20begin%20as%20signals%20generated,they're%20several%20centimeters%20apart." target="_blank"&gt;somatosensory cortex&lt;/a&gt;, an area of the brain that maintains a detailed map of the body.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When you touch something with your hand, a certain region's activated," Schone says. "If you feel something with your toes, a different region is activated."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before the amputation, participants in the scanner would move their fingers, allowing scientists to see which brain regions responded. Up to five years after the amputation, participants imagined moving their missing fingers.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Earlier studies had suggested that after the loss of a hand, the brain would shift the borders of its body map. The area responding to the missing hand would shrink, while the neighboring area linked to the lips would expand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But that's not what the team found.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's no evidence that the map of the lips is changing," Schone says, "which goes completely against all of those old studies that suggest if you lose this body part, this region of the brain is going to completely reorganize."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Earlier studies were limited because they compared the brains of people who'd already lost a limb with the brains of typical people. The new study appears to be the first to look at the same person's brain before and after an amputation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Prosthetic arms and phantom limb pain&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Like many people who've had an amputation, Wheldon often feels pain in her phantom arm and hand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's like a throbbing pain that becomes quite unbearable at times," she says. Sometimes it feels like her wrist is sore, other times it's like her fingers are cramping.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Previous research suggested phantom limb pain was the result of changes in the brain's body map. But the new study suggests it occurs &lt;em&gt;because &lt;/em&gt;the map hasn't changed, and the brain is still expecting signals from the missing body part.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Imagine if you had a nerve that was receiving a highly detailed information for the body and suddenly now it's receiving some strange, atypical input," Schone says. "How the brain would deal with something like this?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It might interpret the input as pain, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If so, he says, the solution may lie in finding a new home for a nerve ending, rather than just leaving it exposed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;An unchanging body map could be a huge boost for the emerging field of brain-computer interfaces, which can allow a paralyzed person to speak or move a robotic arm.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many of these interfaces place electrodes in the same area of the brain that maintains the body map. So they depend on that map remaining constant over many years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new evidence for this "offers a lot of hope for patients with neurological conditions," Sathian says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Emily Wheldon isn't seeking a brain-computer interface that could control a prosthetic left arm.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But she says it's helpful just to have a scientific explanation of why her missing limb still seems like it's attached, and sometimes hurts.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"A lot of people don't realize that you can actually still feel the limb," she says, "and they're shocked when I say I'm suffering from phantom pain."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wheldon has been able to control that pain with electrical stimulation and a therapy that uses a visual representation of the missing limb. And she says the phantom pain is much less severe than the pain she felt when her arm was still there.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Back then, the pain was so intense I couldn't look after my newborn daughter," she says. Now she's back at work and able to help her kids get dressed and ready for school.&lt;/p&gt;

Social distancing is just a vague memory. Interest in vaccines is waning. COVID, for many, feels like an inevitable annoyance, like the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, each summer, we get a rude reminder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The season of travel and fun continues to bring a spike in COVID-19 activity, far less profound than during the height of the pandemic but enough for people to notice and worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer’s jump is being fueled by the subvariant XFG, nicknamed “Stratus.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we learn more about COVID, we are seeing that it has two surges a year: the late fall/early winter and in the summer, so we expect this trend of increased cases in the summer to continue,” said Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, the regional chief of infectious disease at Kaiser Permanente Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-summer" class="subhead"&gt;Why summer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of factors that could explain why COVID activity seems to ramp up along with the temperature, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Summertime travel and increased social mixing because of social events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Spending time indoors to beat the heat: Respiratory viruses tend to spread more easily in environments with low humidity and cool temperatures. Air-conditioned spaces might not have adequate ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Waning immunity from vaccination and previous infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Mutations: As the virus spreads, it acquires mutations that allow it to evade our existing immunity. Eventually, a version of the virus collects enough mutations that it has a slight edge over other viruses, and if other factors line up, it can sweep through a population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-the-numbers-show" class="subhead"&gt;What do the numbers show?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which coronavirus tests in California came back positive was 11.59% for the week ending Aug. 16. That’s up from a positive test rate of 5.69% for the week ending July 19, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/RespiratoryVirusReport.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;California Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The positive test rate is expected to further increase in the coming weeks, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COVID-19 test positivity this summer looks similar to [the] summer of 2023 so far,” the department said. That year saw the summer COVID wave &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-10-10/l-a-countys-covid-19-summer-bump-is-declining"&gt;peak in early September&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, which saw &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-12/why-is-covid-still-surging-in-california-a-midsummer-mutation-may-be-to-blame"&gt;the largest summer spike since 2022&lt;/a&gt;, COVID activity maxed out in early August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID is also increasingly a reason why people are seeking urgent medical care. For the week ending Aug. 17, COVID diagnosis was the &lt;a class="link" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#ed-visits_separated_by_age_group" target="_blank"&gt;reason&lt;/a&gt; why 4.04% of children in California up to age 11 were in the emergency room — up from 1.02% during the last week in June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID was the reason why 2.25% of people age 75 and older were in the emergency room over the same period, up from 1.13% during the last week of June, state data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="so-what-the-pandemic-emergency-is-over" class="subhead"&gt;So what? The pandemic emergency is over&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise in COVID comes as the disease has receded as a major worry from the minds of many, with fewer people getting annual COVID vaccines and even fewer wearing masks in any setting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, COVID can result in significant illness — a “razor blade” sore throat and miserable cough for some and hospitalization and even &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; for the very young, very old and chronically ill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a class="link" href="https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Preliminary-2024-2025-U-S-COVID-19-Burden-Estimate/ahrf-yqdt/about_data" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that at least 38,000 have &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/surveillance/burden-estimates.html" target="_blank"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; from COVID-19 for the season that began Oct. 1. During the same period, the CDC estimates the number of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;flu deaths&lt;/a&gt; to be at least 27,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time,&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-02/how-common-is-long-covid-a-new-study-provides-fresh-clues"&gt; long COVID &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-02-14/risk-for-chronic-fatigue-soars-among-covid-19-patients-study-says"&gt;other related impacts&lt;/a&gt; of the coronavirus remain major issues for &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/long-covid/php/scientific-approach/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;millions.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-vaccine-numbers-like" class="subhead"&gt;What are the vaccine numbers like?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 14.7% of California’s population has received the updated COVID-19 vaccine that first became &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2024-08-22/fda-approves-updated-covid-19-vaccines-shots-should-be-available-in-days"&gt;available nearly a year ago&lt;/a&gt;. Uptake was greatest among the oldest Californians, with 37.2% of state seniors age 65 and up getting the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those ages 50 to 64, 17.7% have gotten their shot, as have 9.5% of younger adults ages 18 to 49. Among children ages 5 to 11, 5.9% have been vaccinated, and for those younger than 5, 3.2% have been vaccinated with the latest COVID-19 vaccine formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health continues to recommend that everyone age 6 months and older stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is particularly important for higher-risk individuals, such as infants and toddlers, pregnant individuals, older persons, and others with risks for serious disease,” the department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department’s advice resembles the CDC’s past guidance, which has changed since the start of the second Trump administration and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-02-13/robert-f-kennedy-jr-confirmed-health-human-services"&gt;the appointment of&lt;/a&gt; vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to head the CDC’s parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC now says it offers “no guidance” as to whether healthy pregnant women should get the COVID vaccine, and asks parents of healthy children to talk with a healthcare provider before getting the COVID vaccine for their youngsters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainstream medical organizations, like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, continue to recommend that people receive the updated COVID-19 vaccine at any point during pregnancy. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends infants and children ages 6 months to 23 months get the updated COVID vaccine, since they are at high risk of severe illness should they get COVID, and that the vaccine should be offered for children age 2 and older if their parent wishes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some doctors, including Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious diseases expert, have suggested that people who haven’t been vaccinated in more than a year, and are at risk for severe complications should they get COVID, get vaccinated with the currently available shots now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong noted that the 2025-26 version of the COVID vaccine should be “relatively the same formula” as the 2024-25 version. “It’s less important to wait,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eligibility for the new vaccine has been delayed by the Trump administration, and it isn’t clear when it’ll become available or who will be eligible outside of older people and those with chronic health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some pharmacy chains and health providers have paused online scheduling of appointments for COVID-19 vaccines until the 2025-26 version is released, presumably later this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at least one chain, CVS, says all of its pharmacies nationwide offer the 2024-25 version of the COVID-19 vaccine and that it is available on a walk-in basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All CVS Pharmacy locations across the U.S. currently offer the COVID-19 vaccine. We’ll continue to offer to eligible patients, as determined by the [Food and Drug Administration] and CDC, until an updated 2025-2026 vaccine is released,” CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault said in a statement to The Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Digital vaccination scheduling is paused temporarily, but we are still offering walk-in COVID-19 vaccinations,” Thibault said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-might-the-rest-of-the-summer-look-like" class="subhead"&gt;What might the rest of the summer look like?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials note that the spread of COVID appears to be less severe this summer compared to last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across California, levels of the coronavirus detected in wastewater are about 20% lower than the peak of the 2023 summer wave, and about 50% below the height of the 2024 summer wave, the state Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this time of year, COVID hospitalizations are currently considered low, based off thresholds “established from the data from the past five seasons,” the department said. “Deaths are also lower than previous seasons.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-can-i-do-to-protect-myself" class="subhead"&gt;What can I do to protect myself?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some steps those concerned about COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases can take: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Get vaccinated now, especially if you’re at higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19 and haven’t received a vaccine in more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• If you do get sick with COVID-19, talk with a medical provider about getting &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-01-28/paxlovid-anitivirals-for-many-should-be-easier-to-get-heres-what-to-know"&gt;an anti-COVID drug like Paxlovid&lt;/a&gt;, which can reduce the duration of illness and alleviate symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Stay away from sick people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Wear a well-fitting mask, like a KF94 or an N95, in indoor public settings — or perhaps at least carry one with you if you’re traveling, so you can wear it if someone is coughing on a plane. “Now’s a good time to mask in indoor public places if you’re in a high-risk group,” wrote Dr. Matt Willis, former public health officer for Marin County, on the “Your Local Epidemiologist in California” &lt;a class="link" href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-171508787" target="_blank"&gt;blog.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Optimize indoor air quality — opening a window helps!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Test if you’re ill with COVID-like symptoms or have been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here’s some advice about flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Health officials recommend everyone age 6 months and older get the flu shot for the upcoming season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The vaccine for RSV is &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; for all adults age 75 and older and those ages 50 to 74 who are at increased risk for RSV. People who have already received the RSV vaccine in recent years don’t need another dose at this time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/hcp/vaccine-clinical-guidance/pregnant-people.html" target="_blank"&gt;Pregnant&lt;/a&gt; women should also get a single dose of an RSV vaccine during weeks 32 through 36 of their pregnancy, sometime between September through January.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPekQzRDhsTHJrdTJqOTY2UzlRRHlvaV9aMm5HbzI5TWU1TThtZVVTZTZXTWRkODBFWl93LUs5aWZQYjNsN3FJV3NIS1VvZkhTWEZ1cjB0VjNpdl9rczRsNGxMMGNLN1ptOE5pOTNGZkw5Vy1CUVA1Ml8xRWxPQ2Y0WTRWd243V3RGdjJoU0FwSzlNMFc3MzlqNFJMNVZMbDVmYkhMaG5ZOA</guid></item><item><title>诊断困境：罕见病使女性将人视为龙- Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/diagnostic-dilemma-rare-condition-made-a-woman-see-people-as-dragons</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;

She also saw dragon-like faces appear in front of her spontaneously, even when no people were present. These hallucinations were disturbing and affected her ability to interact with people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="8c30c2e3-d5d1-4519-94ab-9326eaa00f07-2"&gt;The patient reported that human faces that seemed normal at first "turned black, grew long, pointy ears and a protruding snout, and displayed a reptiloid skin and huge eyes in bright yellow, green, blue, or red," doctors wrote &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2961690-1/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2961690-1/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in a report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of her case.

All of the results were normal. However, an MRI of the patient's brain showed several lesions near the lentiform nucleus. Damage to this part of the brain has been &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8566813/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8566813/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;linked to cognitive impairments&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, such as issues with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/cognitive-impairment-in-schizophrenia/E8374E67E84DFD78738923A31CF75A5E" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/cognitive-impairment-in-schizophrenia/E8374E67E84DFD78738923A31CF75A5E" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;attention and memory&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, particularly associated with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These lesions — which appeared in the insulated wiring of the brain, called white matter — may have been caused by ruptures in small blood vessels in the brain. But the damage was not recent, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the EEG did not reveal any abnormalities, the doctors suspected that the patient's visual hallucinations were caused by atypical electrical activity in parts of the brain that process colors and faces — specifically, the ventral occipitotemporal cortex. This region, located in the back of the brain, is involved in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8260247/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8260247/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;regulating object recognition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The lesions revealed by the MRI may have triggered this electrical activity, the doctors theorized, and they &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61690-1/attachment/5ba04f26-5634-4a1a-9837-a3b727d717d4/mmc1.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61690-1/attachment/5ba04f26-5634-4a1a-9837-a3b727d717d4/mmc1.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;may have been present since birth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps caused by temporary oxygen deprivation shortly before or after delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;The physicians determined that the woman had a form of &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://prosopometamorphopsia.faceblind.org/" data-url="https://prosopometamorphopsia.faceblind.org/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;prosopometamorphopsia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (PMO). This uncommon condition affects how a person perceives human faces, making facial features appear dramatically distorted. Features may seem enlarged or shrunken; they may sag, stretch sideways or drift out of position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zS5JKXrWByWWY4Lk7S3WzD" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zS5JKXrWByWWY4Lk7S3WzD slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://prosopometamorphopsia.faceblind.org/hemipmo/" target="_blank" data-url="https://prosopometamorphopsia.faceblind.org/hemipmo/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hemi-prosopometamorphopsia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or hemi-PMO, just one side of the observed face is affected. In full-face prosopometamorphopsia, or full-face PMO, distortion warps the entire face a person sees. The condition is associated with changes to brain structure and with disorders that affect brain function, such as epilepsy, migraine and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b21a1a75-03de-4c56-a3e0-6fcd7944b226"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;The doctors prescribed the patient daily doses of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682412.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682412.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;valproic acid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an anticonvulsant that prevents seizures and also alleviates migraines and symptoms of bipolar disorder. The treatment brought the woman's visual hallucinations under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she then began experiencing hallucinations of banging sounds in her sleep. The doctors switched her to a daily regimen of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/20352-rivastigmine-capsules" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/20352-rivastigmine-capsules" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rivastigmine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a drug that is commonly used to treat symptoms of dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. The drug made these auditory hallucinations less frequent and reduced her visual symptoms to a manageable level. After three years of this treatment, the woman reported that her work situation had stabilized and her social relationships had improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Prosopometamorphopsia is exceptionally rare, with only 81 cases described in the medical literature over the past 100 years, according to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33865569/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33865569/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a 2021 review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people who experience this condition, its distorting effect on human faces lasts just a few days or weeks. PMO-triggered distortions have been known to make &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00136-3/abstract" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00136-3/abstract" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;people's faces appear "demonic"&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — but in the woman's case, it's unclear exactly what caused her highly specific perception of reptilian dragons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-zS5JKXrWByWWY4Lk7S3WzD-UwqIvBA8Pk9mB7Cb6sbVwqwdSRrQFeBi" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-zS5JKXrWByWWY4Lk7S3WzD-UwqIvBA8Pk9mB7Cb6sbVwqwdSRrQFeBi slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmesg9amn001u26p58na1840r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Just southwest of New Orleans, in a tranquil fishing village on the Louisiana bayou, Linard Lyons spent the morning on his 19-foot boat, preparing crab traps for his grandchildren just like he had done thousands of times before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeszzo2p000i3b6nhlhy3sd8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This time, he noticed a tiny scratch on his leg – a scratch that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/18/health/dual-hurricanes-milton-and-helene-cause-flesh-eating-bacteria-cases-to-rise-in-florida" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;nearly cost him his life&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjiz00033j6o9dhb0hk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lyons went about his day but woke up the following morning feeling “delusional.” Feverish and vomiting, he initially thought he had just contracted a stomach bug, but then discovered a series of blackening sores spreading across his left leg.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000043j6of5cvjgau@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In what turned out to be a life-saving move, he went straight to his family doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000053j6o34kkfv41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lyons tells CNN his doctor immediately knew “exactly what it was” and sent him straight to the emergency room. In the “matter of maybe an hour,” Lyons found himself in the hospital’s operating room.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000063j6o1487gcrl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That small scratch on Lyons’ leg became the entryway for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/20/health/what-is-vibrio-explainer"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus&lt;/a&gt;, also known as flesh-eating bacteria. Those black sores on his leg signified &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/09/health/sargassum-seaweed-blob-flesh-eating-bacteria-scn-wellness/index.html"&gt;necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt;, which “affects the tissue under your skin,” according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23103-necrotizing-fasciitis" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000073j6ovya4755u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These potentially deadly bacteria are naturally found and thrive in coastal waters during the warmer months, especially in brackish waters, where fresh water meets the sea, according to the US &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html#:~:text=Vibrio%20are%20bacteria%20that%20naturally%20live%20in%20certain%20coastal%20waters.%20They%20are%20found%20in%20higher%20numbers%20in%20May%20through%20October%2C%20when%20water%20temperatures%20are%20warmer" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease and Control Prevention.&lt;/a&gt; Once largely confined to the Gulf Coast, cases have surged along the East Coast, with an 800% increase from 1988 to 2018, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00497.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000093j6ozwekyk7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Do I have permission to do what I need to do to save your life?” Lyons’ doctor asked.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000a3j6oj1547k3b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These were the last words Lyons recalled hearing before surgery. He immediately understood the seriousness of the situation and realized his leg may have to be amputated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000b3j6oi2ix73h4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was given a 50/50 chance of coming out of the hospital alive at that point,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000c3j6og3v0icqr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;surgeons were able to both cut away the infection and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;save Lyons’&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;leg. After three days in the intensive care unit, three weeks in the hospital and various antibiotics, he was “cleared of the bacteria.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000d3j6o37igh08h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It has been more than three months since he contracted the flesh-eating bacteria, yet his recovery is far from over.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000e3j6obudqm05k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recovery has not been comfortable for Lyons, who has diabetes; he describes it as a “misery.” Yet, he remains hopeful that a skin graft will be the final step in getting his leg back to “normal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000f3j6o5tne85no@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vibrio vulnificus should generally not pose a fatal risk to the average person, Mississippi’s State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney tells CNN. People with a weakened immune system have a higher risk of contracting an infection, Edney said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000g3j6o0aaodvjq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you plan to be in coastal water, assume it&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is contaminated with Vibrio and avoid the water if you have “cuts or wounds that could be potentially infected,” according to Edney.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000h3j6o5ve0cf9n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Vibrio infection doesn’t occur only through wound-to-water contact. It can also stem from consuming certain foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000j3j6ohhe5r4px@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;“CONSUMING RAW OR UNDERCOOKED MEATS, POULTRY, SEAFOOD, SHELLFISH OR EGGS MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF FOODBORNE ILLNESS, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE CERTAIN MEDICAL CONDITIONS.”&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000k3j6ofhmeurcx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This warning, often found in small print at the bottom of restaurant&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;menus, may look familiar. In Louisiana, this specific warning must be “clearly visible” at all establishments that sell or serve raw oysters – with few exceptions – according to the &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/page/654" target="_blank"&gt;Louisiana Department of Health.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000l3j6o5o6k1wu8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vibriosis can also be contracted by eating raw or undercooked shellfish. Most often it’s a less serious infection from a different type of the bacteria, causing only stomach discomfort, but can occasionally find its way into the bloodstream, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00497.html#:~:text=Vibrio%20are%20bacteria%20that%20cause,About%20150%E2%80%93200%20V." target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000m3j6ohw7n35qw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Oysters get their food by filtering out sea water. When that water is ripe with bacteria, a single oyster could contain as many as a million Vibrio vulnificus cells, according to &lt;a href="https://pages.charlotte.edu/jim-oliver/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jim Oliver&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000o3j6oq539u1zd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though it’s rare, “many people with Vibrio vulnificus infection can get seriously ill and need intensive care or limb amputation. About 1 in 5 people with this infection die, sometimes within a day or two of becoming ill,” according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000p3j6old747hzd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Louisiana was one of the first states to bring attention to this infection this season after it saw a spike in cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000q3j6ow033e5nd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By the end of July, &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/vibrio-vulnificus-2025" target="_blank"&gt;officials reported&lt;/a&gt; 17 hospitalizations and four deaths among Louisiana residents, more than double what they typically see. At least three more cases were reported in August.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000r3j6o65p7tzi4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This potentially deadly virus is not just unique to the Gulf states and is being found farther north as water temperatures rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000t3j6oz4ttrr8a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/department-of-public-health-alerts-public-to-rare-vibrio-vulnificus-bacteria-in-coastal-waters" target="_blank"&gt;Massachusetts Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; identified an “extremely rare” case of Vibrio vulnificus from a resident exposed to coastal water near Martha’s Vineyard. So far this year, Massachusetts has confirmed 71 cases, with a 30% hospitalization rate and no deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000u3j6ocrhay1vd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Massachusetts, however, is not the only East Coast state reporting increased cases. Virginia Department of Health officials say cases of vibriosis across its residents have been “increasing over the last ten years.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000v3j6o87vykfw7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases in North Carolina have increased 620% over the past 10 years, and New York’s have more than tripled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000w3j6oy4hovzsk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists link this trend to climate change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmesvb4lu00003b6n2wapy2ft@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The oceans are getting warmer and sea level is rising because of human-caused climate change, and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580166/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK580166.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;scientists warn&lt;/a&gt; these factors are increasing the risk of Vibrio infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000z3j6o5isz7nq9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Oliver, the UNC Charlotte professor, added that melting glaciers are lowering ocean salinity – another factor that increases the threat. “Open sea salt water has too high of a salinity rate for Vibrio vulnificus,” he explained. But when fresh water dilutes it, the “conditions become more favorable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000103j6o90ntf17f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As the climate warms, more bacteria stays alive through the winter, which worsens outbreaks in the summer because we’re starting from an already elevated level.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeswo6wb00043b6npv5rbebq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Rachel Noble, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has studied Vibrio since the early 2000s,&lt;strong&gt;﻿&lt;/strong&gt; told CNN the increased prevalence of this potentially deadly bacterium is being “repeated globally,” indicating a “complexity of issues related to climate change.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000123j6oam4l7997@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This isn’t going to be the only pathogen that increases in the face of climate change,” Noble said. “It’s just one example, but one we can really learn from.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Lyons is encouraging others to learn about Vibrio and hopes local leaders will spread awareness by posting additional signage to warn both residents and visitors. Any wounds, even a tiny scratch, should be thoroughly washed with soap and clean running water, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/prevention/index.html#:~:text=Immediately%20wash%20wounds%20and%20cuts%20thoroughly%20with%20soap%20and%20clean%20running%20water%20after%20contact%20with%20coastal%20waters%20or%20raw%20seafood%2C%20its%20drippings%2C%20or%20its%20juices." target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.

            “I hope my story helps people understand what to look out for,” Lyons said. It might even “save a life.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000163j6o35xxojr7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you develop symptoms, “seek help immediately and get to the emergency room,” Lyons urges. “That’s the best thing. Just go there and hopefully you’ll see someone who will recognize it for what it is, because a misdiagnosis can be a death sentence. It really can be.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

While diet is important, research shows that light activity after eating can significantly reduce these spikes by helping muscles absorb glucose from the bloodstream. French biochemist Jessie Inchauspé, widely known as the Glucose Goddess, recently shared on Instagram a simple, science-backed exercise that requires no gym or equipment. This easy routine can help stabilise blood sugar, boost energy, and support overall metabolic health, making it a practical habit for anyone looking to manage post-meal glucose naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why calf raises after meals work for &lt;keyword id="20068265" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="blood-sugar-control" source="keywords"&gt;blood sugar control&lt;/keyword&gt; and how to do it right&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soleus muscle acts like a “glucose sponge” because it draws sugar from the blood for energy, even without high-intensity effort. Activating this muscle after a meal helps reduce postprandial glucose levels, preventing sharp spikes that lead to energy crashes and metabolic stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;No Gym Needed: Try This Effective Home Workout To Get Fit Quickly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her Instagram reel, Jessie suggests doing calf raises for 5–10 minutes immediately after meals. This simple move activates the soleus muscle in your lower legs, a muscle that is especially efficient at using glucose for energy, even at low-intensity levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Here’s how to do it:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Stand or sit with your feet flat on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Slowly lift your heels off the ground, rising onto your toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Lower your heels back down and repeat at a steady pace for 5–10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of calf raises is that they’re low impact, convenient, and can be done anywhere, while brushing your teeth, cooking, or even sitting at your desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;keyword id="26260500" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="health-benefits-of-calf-raises" source="keywords"&gt;Health benefits of calf raises&lt;/keyword&gt; after meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1.

Why do blood sugar spikes happen after meals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood sugar spikes occur when carbohydrates from food break down into glucose and enter the bloodstream faster than the body can process them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. How does exercise help lower blood sugar after eating?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity stimulates muscles to take up glucose from the blood, reducing post-meal spikes and improving insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. Why calf raises instead of other exercises?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calf raises target the soleus muscle, which is highly efficient at using glucose for energy, even at low intensity and without heavy exertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. How long should I do calf raises after a meal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessie Inchauspé recommends 5–10 minutes immediately after finishing your meal for the best results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. Can walking after meals have the same effect?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, light walking can also reduce blood sugar spikes, but calf raises are a convenient alternative if you can’t leave your space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A protein-based biosensor measures cortisol with high &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;accuracy&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;A measure of how close a result or measurement is to the true value.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;accuracy&lt;/span&gt;. Smartphone compatibility makes stress testing more accessible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortisol plays a key role in regulating essential body functions such as blood pressure and metabolism, and disruptions in this stress hormone can contribute to a variety of health problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, measuring cortisol required visits to a doctor’s office or other clinical facilities. A recent breakthrough in artificial biosensor technology now offers the possibility of point-of-care testing, providing more accurate results than existing methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Smartphone-enabled testing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Yeh, an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/uc-santa-cruz/"&gt;University of California, Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;, has developed a luminescent artificial sensor that attaches to cortisol molecules in blood or urine. Once bound, the sensor produces light, which reveals the concentration of the hormone. A study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/em&gt; confirmed that this method can reliably detect cortisol across the full range of levels important for human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeh showed that the sensor could be paired with a smartphone camera, allowing cortisol levels to be measured either at home or in a clinic. This approach combines high sensitivity with affordability, eliminating the need for expensive laboratory equipment and making precise hormone monitoring far more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Designed from scratch&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeh specializes in artificial protein engineering, which relies on AI-based computational design to create entirely new proteins rather than modifying ones already found in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project, he built a protein-based biosensor where cortisol binding causes two engineered proteins to draw close together at the molecular level. This interaction produces a light signal, with brighter emissions corresponding to higher cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_490855" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-490855" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-490855" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-777x491.jpg" alt="Andy Yeh in the Lab" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-777x491.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-400x253.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-768x485.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-1536x970.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-2048x1294.jpg 2048w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-150x95.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-450x284.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-1200x758.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-490855" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;UC Santa Cruz Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Andy Yeh’s lab focuses on artificial protein design. Credit: Impact Creative for UC Santa Cruz&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Yeh’s knowledge, this is the first example of a completely computationally designed biosensor that can perform with such high sensitivity and dynamic range for detecting a small molecule analyte. Using a camera to measure the amount and color of light emitted allows cortisol levels to be read with more sensitivity than current tests provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Point-of-care applications&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new diagnostic tool would be in a “mix and read” format—similar to the technique used in Covid-19 nasal swab rapid tests. The test requires just a drop of blood or urine, which is mixed with a solution that contains the biosensor. Then, a smartphone camera and app could translate the light emitted into a direct measurement of cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can read the signal directly — the output of the sensor is light emissions, so essentially you can just take a picture of the test with your smartphone,” Yeh said. “Ideally, that’s really field compatible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dynamic results&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test’s high level of sensitivity is a vast improvement over traditional tests, which don’t usually offer enough quantitative results when outside of the cortisol normal range. Yeh’s solution covers a wider dynamic range, offering quantitative results for healthy, too-low, and elevated levels of cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This sensor is very, very sensitive compared to the current standard methods used in the hospital,” Yeh said. “The dynamic range is huge compared to the traditional assay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down the line, Yeh envisions that this technology may also be used in a drug-development or diagnostic setting to better understand and treat the health issues that arise from cortisol deficiencies or surpluses.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Exercise is a cornerstone of good health and evidence shows it can even help &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/exercise-proves-powerful-in-preventing-colon-cancer-recurrence-new-study-257983"&gt;prevent cancers returning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502760"&gt;following treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But new findings are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;raising an unexpected question&lt;/a&gt;: could very high-volume endurance training carry its own risks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, researchers from Inova Schar  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="172173" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Institute reported that a surprising number of dedicated marathon and ultramarathon runners had precancerous growths in their colons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brain-might-start-eating-itself-during-strenuous-endurance-exercise"&gt;Your Brain Might Start 'Eating Itself' During Strenuous Endurance Exercise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 100 athletes aged 35 to 50, &lt;a href="https://www.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/ABSTRACT491966"&gt;15% had advanced adenomas&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/nejmra1513581"&gt;lesions&lt;/a&gt; that can develop into bowel cancer – while 41% had at least one adenoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is small and not yet peer-reviewed, but the signal is strong enough to have &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14768309/colon-cancer-running-asco-2025.html"&gt;captured&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;global&lt;/a&gt; attention. Here's what the findings really mean, why experts urge caution in interpreting the results, and what runners should watch for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it seems counterintuitive. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-cut-your-risk-of-cancer-by-an-oncology-consultant-245858"&gt;Decades of evidence&lt;/a&gt; show regular exercise &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6527123/"&gt;lowers cancer risks&lt;/a&gt;, including bowel cancer, and improves outcomes &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/59/14/1010"&gt;after a cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172180" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172180" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer2_642.jpg" alt="woman running" class="wp-image-172180 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer2_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer2_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer2_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172180" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Exercise reduces risks of many cancers. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MABqghXaI2U/"&gt;Jacob Lund/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study doesn't overturn that science. Instead, it suggests a narrow group of young, very high–volume endurance athletes might face unique bowel stress that could increase their odds of developing precancerous changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/colon-cancer-rates-are-rising-among-young-people-could-changes-to-childrens-gut-bacteria-explain-why-255176"&gt;Young people with colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; has been called a new  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="172173" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bowel-cancer-is-on-the-rise-in-under-50s-heres-what-might-explain-the-trend-246447"&gt;we don't really understand&lt;/a&gt; why it's &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alcohol-plays-a-major-role-in-new-cancer-cases/"&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inova study deliberately excluded people with known genetic conditions or bowel disease to focus on runners who otherwise seemed low risk. Yet their screening found more advanced lesions than expected for that age group – a pattern outside experts, commenting in the New York Times, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; as worth investigating, not a final answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might heavy endurance training contribute to bowel changes? One theory focuses on temporary blood flow reductions to the gut during prolonged, intense exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distance runners are familiar with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5675973/"&gt;runner's colitis&lt;/a&gt; – cramping and occasional bleeding after long runs. Repeated cycles of low–oxygen stress, inflammation and tissue repair in the bowel could, theoretically, encourage adenoma development in susceptible people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inova team highlighted this mechanism based on observations and runners' reports of gut symptoms, though the study didn't directly measure blood flow, oxygen or inflammation markers. It also didn't isolate other lifestyle factors that might matter, such as dehydration strategies, anti–inflammatory drug use, specific nutrition practices, or very low body fat levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as important is what this study doesn't establish. It doesn't prove marathons or ultramarathons cause bowel cancer. It doesn't show most young–onset bowel cancers occur in runners – doctors not involved in the study &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;emphasised&lt;/a&gt; that most younger patients with these cancers aren't endurance athletes. And it doesn't address whether more moderate exercise carries similar risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comparison point – the expected rate of &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1309086"&gt;advanced adenomas&lt;/a&gt; in the late 40s – comes from broader population studies, not from a matched control group. That makes the observed difference notable but still preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is clinically grounded, but its size and design mean it should be seen as a starting point for larger studies rather than a basis for changing general &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/coping/physically/exercise-guidelines"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040842825001064"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there are practical lessons for endurance athletes and doctors. First, persistent blood in stool, changes in bowel habits, unexplained stomach pain, or iron–deficiency anaemia shouldn't be dismissed as "just running".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a community where gut complaints are common and often normalised, it's easy to miss warning signs. The lead oncologist argued that young runners with bleeding after long runs should be offered screening – a stance grounded in the fact that colonoscopy can remove precancerous lesions and prevent cancers developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is more cautious than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/colorectal-cancer/screening/index.html"&gt;current guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for average–risk adults but aligns with individualised, symptom–driven care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the study reinforces the difference between exercise as medicine and exercise as extreme sport. For &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38920329/"&gt;cancer prevention and overall health&lt;/a&gt;, the strongest &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-024-02748-x"&gt;evidence supports regular&lt;/a&gt;, moderate–to–vigorous &lt;a href="https://cancerci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12935-022-02670-3"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt;, not necessarily repeated ultra–endurance feats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172178" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172178" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer_642.jpg" alt="bowel polyp" class="wp-image-172178 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172178" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Polyps can be removed during a colonoscopy. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFwwWUduCY/"&gt;Sebastian Kaulitzki/Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Careful attention needed – not panic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent conferences highlighted data showing structured exercise after bowel cancer treatment improves long–term outcomes, underlining that physical activity remains one of the most powerful, low–cost tools in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6527123/"&gt;cancer prevention and care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This runner study doesn't contradict that larger story. It flags a potential exception at the extreme end of training that needs careful attention, not panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future research confirms a link, what might change? Screening recommendations could evolve for a clearly defined group of high–volume endurance athletes, perhaps starting colonoscopy earlier than the current age–45 threshold for average–risk adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athletes and coaches might adapt training, nutrition and recovery to protect gut health – paying attention to hydration, heat stress, gradual progression, and avoiding unnecessary anti–inflammatory medication around long efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sports medicine and gastroenterology clinics might work together on protocols for evaluating gut bleeding in runners, narrowing the gap between &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10116569/"&gt;"common" and "concerning"&lt;/a&gt; symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these steps depend on replication in larger, diverse groups and understanding which components of endurance life – intensity, duration, heat, altitude, nutrition – matter most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, a balanced message serves the public best. Endurance running is a profound source of meaning and health for many people, and quitting running isn't the lesson from a single small study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is keeping the proven benefits of exercise in view while being clear–eyed about potential risks at extremes. Listen to your body's signals, especially bleeding. Treat red–flag symptoms as medical, not merely athletic. And discuss personal risk factors and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4955831/"&gt;family history&lt;/a&gt; with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As science probes this signal further, the likely outcome isn't a blanket warning but more nuanced guidance: who might need earlier screening, when to investigate symptoms, and how to train hard with the gut in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's real contribution may be cultural as much as clinical: it gives runners and doctors permission to ask a question they've too often waved away, and to catch dangerous lesions before they become cancers.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263564/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

People who scored higher in traits such as narcissism, psychopathy, and unrestricted sexual desires were more likely to report finding both dates and sexual partners through the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although previous research has explored the psychological profiles of dating app users, there has been less focus on what predicts actual outcomes—such as how many people secure dates or engage in sex as a result of using the apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers wanted to understand not only who uses dating apps, but who succeeds on them. They applied a framework known as life history theory, which suggests that individuals vary in how they allocate effort toward mating and parenting. People with “fast” life history strategies tend to focus on short-term mating and self-enhancement, while those with “slow” strategies prioritize long-term relationships and caregiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study framed dating apps like Tinder as “digital leks,” drawing from a term in biology. In some animal species, males gather in leks—territories where they display themselves to attract mates but provide no parental investment. Females visit these areas solely to select mating partners. Tinder was considered analogous because it allows people to advertise themselves to a large pool of potential partners in a visually driven, low-effort environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I started my research in the area of dating apps and social media, I dived deeper into theoretical explanations of our behavior,” said study author Lennart Freyth, the founder and research director of the Behavioral and Social Sciences Institute and a professor at HSD Hochschule Döpfer University of Applied Sciences. “Considering personality a behavioral disposition, I was indeed wondering: why was nobody going for the most obvious elements of dating apps? It took a bit to prepare and to present it, but everyone was fine and liked the idea to explore who are the people who go on dates (via these apps) and who engages in sexual intercourse (via these dates/apps).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesized that traits associated with fast life strategies—such as narcissism, psychopathy, and high levels of sociosexual desire—would predict greater dating app success. They were also interested in whether these dynamics differed by sex, and how decision-making styles like “satisficing” (being easily satisfied) or seeking alternative options might factor in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their new study, the research team surveyed 495 German-speaking adults, including 288 men and 207 women, aged 16 to 70 years. Participants were recruited online and received a small monetary incentive for their participation. Each person completed a series of questionnaires measuring various traits and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used validated scales to assess the three so-called “Dark Triad” traits—narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy—as well as components of sociosexuality, which include attitudes toward casual sex, sexual desire, and previous sexual behavior. They also measured decision-making styles related to dating, such as how easily participants felt satisfied with potential matches or how often they searched for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked whether they had ever gone on a date arranged through a dating app (referred to as a “Tinder-date”) and whether they had ever had sex with someone they met on such an app (“Tinder-sex”). The researchers then examined which personality and behavioral traits predicted each outcome, using statistical analyses that accounted for sex differences and interaction effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 31 percent of participants reported having gone on a date via Tinder or a similar app, with no significant difference between men and women. However, among those who reported having sex with someone they met on a dating app, men were more likely than women to do so—66 percent of those who had Tinder-sex were men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who reported either dating or having sex through Tinder tended to be younger and displayed traits associated with fast life strategies. For example, they scored higher in narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and all three aspects of sociosexuality: more favorable attitudes toward casual sex, greater sexual desire, and more sexual experience. These traits were generally stronger predictors of sexual outcomes than of dating alone, suggesting that sexual style becomes more relevant as the encounter progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men who reported having sex via Tinder were especially likely to score higher in psychopathy and sexual desire. This pattern did not hold for men who had not had Tinder-sex or for women in either group. The authors suggest that psychopathy in this context may not only reflect exploitative tendencies but may also indicate a strategic ability to identify others who are open to uncommitted sex. This aligns with &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/people-with-more-narcissistic-and-psychopathic-traits-report-having-a-higher-number-of-sexual-partners/" target="_blank"&gt;previous findings&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/psychopathic-men-have-an-extreme-focus-on-mating-at-the-expense-of-other-domains-and-tend-be-parasitic-fathers/" target="_blank"&gt;psychopathic men&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/psychopathic-men-have-more-children-study-finds/" target="_blank"&gt;may be more successful&lt;/a&gt; in short-term mating, particularly in environments with high mate availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who had sex with someone from a dating app were more likely to report being easily satisfied with their choices compared to women who did not. This trait, known as satisficing, did not differ significantly among men. One interpretation is that these women may have invested more effort in selecting potential partners during the messaging phase and were more willing to accept some mismatch or disappointment in person. Another possibility is that this reflects increased sexual agency or a strategy aimed at maximizing reproductive opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that decision-making traits such as alternative search (constantly looking for better options) did not significantly predict mating success. This may suggest that once a match leads to an actual date, being less selective or more focused on present opportunities plays a larger role than ongoing comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some differences between men and women appeared, the overall trend showed that fast life strategies, regardless of sex, tend to be linked with greater success in using dating apps to find both dates and sexual partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a general pattern that emerges when investigating social media use and associated personality traits,” Freyth told PsyPost. “Individuals who have elevated levels of traits associated with a fast life history (like the Dark Triad/Tetrad traits, or sociosexuality) use visual social media platforms more intensely. They also report more dates and sex—here, for instance, men high in psychopathy and sociosexuality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yet, women who reported sex via dating apps lowered their standards (lower satisficing) compared to women not having ‘Tinder-sex.’ We were surprised by women lowering their standards once on a date. We consider this something like a sunk cost effect—after already texting, once on a date, the decision to engage further was already made.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most importantly, while discussing these and similar findings over the years, I made the observation that dating apps are similar to biological leks in the animal kingdom,” Freyth continued. “Meaning, it is a short-term mating environment favoring opportunistic mating behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, there are some limitations to consider. First, the use of self-reported data on sexual behavior may be influenced by social desirability or gendered reporting biases—men may overreport and women may underreport their experiences. The study was also cross-sectional, meaning it cannot determine causality or track how these behaviors change over time. Longitudinal or experimental research would be needed to assess whether fast life strategies cause greater dating app success or simply emerge as a result of using the apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Compared to most studies on dating apps, our sample was relatively old (the average age was around 40 years),” Freyth noted. “We consider it possible that the effects are underestimated here, as younger people are more opportunistic by nature and due to their current socialization (see, e.g., Haidt’s Anxious Generation). As we have some studies on the topic—one was even replicated—I do not consider a severe shortcoming here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recommend future research explore how these short-term strategies impact broader aspects of life, such as long-term relationship formation, parenting, and even moral decision-making. They also argue that dating apps should be more openly discussed in academic and public discourse and that researchers should not shy away from controversial or sexually charged topics due to stigma or potential backlash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scientifically, I would like to see how the short-term-oriented behavior affects other regions of our daily lives, from partner choice, love, and also moral decisions—from the individual to a societal level,” Freyth explained. “In general, after having done several studies on dating apps (and social media) and associated personality traits, I would like to see it as a normalized part of the scientific and public debate. Our scientific peers are very interested in private but do not publicly show their interest. I think scholars should accept science as science, and we, as scientists, in general, should be more liberal in discussing topics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study was a hard fight over almost two years to publish,” Freyth added. “It took nine rounds of revisions until the editor-in-chief decided to publish it, after I kindly asked them to look into it. The text was forced to take up relatively unrelated topics because the reviewers disliked the results and approach. Then, we had a similar follow-up study, which was retracted as the results followed up on men and women cheating via dating apps. I filed a complaint after the fifth internal revision following publication. I think people should differentiate their personal stance on things from research and scientific findings.

			&lt;p&gt;Wild rabbits in Colorado have been discovered with concerning horn-like growths protruding from their heads, &lt;a href="https://x.com/DailyLoud/status/1955394060107256062"&gt;startling people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on social media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thankfully&lt;/span&gt; the condition &lt;a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/frankenstein-rabbits-tentacles-real/"&gt;poses no threat&lt;/a&gt; to humans and other animals, with &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/14/science/frankenstein-rabbits-with-tentacles-spread-across-midwest/"&gt;recent sightings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; also having been reported in Minnesota and Nebraska&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bunnies' 'horns' are a symptom of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shope_papilloma_virus"&gt;Shope papilloma virus&lt;/a&gt;, which spreads through the bites of mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas. This means it's more common in the warmer months, explaining the current increase in observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/wild-pigs-turn-neon-blue-in-california-triggering-warnings"&gt;Wild Pigs Turn 'Neon Blue' in California, Triggering Warnings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNRySLQM8_x/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="171791" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; itself was discovered in 1933 by Richard Shope, though it's likely its bizarre effects have been inspiring accounts of the &lt;a href="https://www.si.edu/stories/worlds-scariest-rabbit"&gt;mythical jackalope&lt;/a&gt; for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been around forever, it's a virus, it's nothing new and it's being sensationalized because people are seeing what it can do to wild rabbits," veterinarian Laurie Hess &lt;a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/08/17/what-the-heck-are-those-zombie-rabbits-found-just-south-of-wyoming-border/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Jackson Walker at Cowboy State Daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These rabbits look freakish but usually these [growths] are benign things, sometimes they will kind of fall off and go away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growths – called papillomas – are wart-like growths on the rabbit's skin made of keratin; a protein also found in our hair and nails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as the related &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/human-papilloma-virus-and-cancer"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt; can cause  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="171791" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; in people, the Shope papilloma can develop into cancerous growths in rabbits. &lt;span&gt;The disease is more likely to become &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/cottontail-rabbit-papillomavirus"&gt;malignant in domestic rabbits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, the animals recover from the virus and the 'horns' fall off. Growths that interfere with the animal's senses, like near its &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-are-rabbits-sprouting-tentacles/"&gt;eyes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.si.edu/stories/worlds-scariest-rabbit"&gt;mouth&lt;/a&gt;, can cause potentially deadly problems, however, like preventing the animal from eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171793" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171793" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/HistoricPaintingOfJackalopeAndRabbits.jpg" alt="Historic painting of jackalope and rabbitsw" class="wp-image-171793 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/HistoricPaintingOfJackalopeAndRabbits.jpg 1023w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/HistoricPaintingOfJackalopeAndRabbits-642x505.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/HistoricPaintingOfJackalopeAndRabbits-527x415.jpg 527w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/HistoricPaintingOfJackalopeAndRabbits-768x604.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/HistoricPaintingOfJackalopeAndRabbits-600x472.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171793" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Plate XLVII of Animalia Qvadrvpedia et Reptilia (Terra) by Joris Hoefnagel, 1575, showing a mythical "horned hare" or jackalope.

&lt;p&gt;Strokes are a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/facts.htm" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;leading cause of death in the US&lt;/a&gt;, with nearly 800,000 people experiencing one every year. On average, a stroke occurs every 40 seconds in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers are jarring and scary, especially for folks who have a family history of stroke or who have risk factors like high blood pressure and certain heart conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can arm yourself with knowledge to recognize the symptoms of a stroke, understand the risk factors and ultimately help protect yourself from experiencing one altogether. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1649629932/brandon-giglio" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Brandon Giglio&lt;/a&gt;, the director of vascular neurology at NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn, about 85% of strokes in the United States are ischemic strokes, meaning they’re caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain. About 15% are hemorrhagic strokes, which occur when a blood vessel ruptures in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And among the people who have strokes, many also experience what is known as a warning stroke in the days, weeks or months beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know about warning strokes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning strokes are known medically as transient ischemic attacks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to most people outside of the medical field, warning strokes are a fleeting yet very dangerous medical condition that can be precursors to full-blown strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, up to one in five people who experience a warning stroke could have a stroke within 90 days if they don’t get medical attention, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/24305-ahmed-itrat" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Ahmed Itrat&lt;/a&gt;, the stroke medical director at Cleveland Clinic Akron General.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is a warning stroke? Medically, it’s referred to as a transient ischemic attack and causes “sudden-onset transient symptoms of neurological injury which resolve on their own,” Itrat said. “These symptoms may be similar to what one would consider a stroke, but the only difference is they don’t lead to a permanent neurological injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, transient ischemic attacks come on quickly, last for a short time, and do not result in the type of brain damage that can be seen with full-fledged strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the lack of potential brain damage does not mean you should ignore a transient ischemic attack. It’s still a medical condition that needs to be taken seriously, Giglio said. “It really is a harbinger in many people for someone who is going to have a stroke even within the next 48 hours and certainly within the next seven, 30, 90 days,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transient ischemic attacks are also commonly referred to as “ministrokes.” But &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/joshua-z-willey-md" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Joshua Willey&lt;/a&gt;, a stroke neurology expert at Columbia University’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said this problematic term minimizes the emergent nature of the condition. The phrase “warning strokes,” on the other hand, highlights that this condition is an emergency, just like a “regular” stroke, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The signs of transient ischemic attacks and strokes are the same.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would say that basically all the same signs and symptoms of a stroke are the signs and symptoms of a transient ischemic attack,” Giglio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three experts who spoke with HuffPost referred to “&lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/stroke-warning-signs" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;BE FAST&lt;/a&gt;” as a widely accepted mnemonic device detailing the signs of stroke. And as the acronym suggests, these symptoms come on quickly, Giglio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what it means:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;alance — changes in balance or a loss of balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;yesight — changes in vision, like blurriness, loss of sight, or double vision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;acial droop — drooping of the face or an uneven smile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;rm — arm weakness on one side of the body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;peech — changes in speech, like slurring words or speaking gibberish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;ime — it’s time to call emergency services. According to Willey, the “t” can also stand for the terrible headache that comes on fast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You could have all of those symptoms, you could have one of those symptoms or any mixture in between,” Giglio said. So, don’t wait around for more than one sign. If you notice any of these issues, go to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outbreak soon became the worst the United States has endured in over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25502931-acting-hhs-secretary-communications-memo-1-21-25/"&gt;interfered with&lt;/a&gt; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-trump-mmwr-bird-flu-studies-blocked-meddling/"&gt;stalled&lt;/a&gt; the agency’s &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-data-analyses-missing-mmwr-bird-flu-seasonal-influenza/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/01/cdc-dei-scientific-data/681531/"&gt;censored&lt;/a&gt; its data, and abruptly &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/politics/probationary-federal-employees-agencies-firings-doge"&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt; staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“CDC hasn’t reached out to us locally,” Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. “My staff feels like we are out here all alone,” &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/170_4ea49e.pdf"&gt;she added&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak,” one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. “All this training and then we weren’t allowed to do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, like many in West Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html"&gt;researchers estimate&lt;/a&gt;. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak that unfolded in West Texas illustrates the danger the country faces under the Trump administration as vaccination &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm"&gt;rates drop&lt;/a&gt;, misinformation flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/"&gt;fueled doubt&lt;/a&gt; in vaccines and exaggerated &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-on-vitamin-a-unsupported-therapies-for-measles/"&gt;the ability of vitamins&lt;/a&gt; to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;Texas outbreak&lt;/a&gt; spread to &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Outbreak-Data"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/public-health-officials-release-information-on-potential-measles-exposures"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/situacion-epidemiologica-de-enfermedades-prevenibles-por-vacunacion"&gt;Mexico’s Chihuahua state&lt;/a&gt; — at minimum. Together these &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm"&gt;linked outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is absolutely outrageous,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. “When you’re battling contagious diseases, time is everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The CDC is ‘stressed’ currently”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-gaines-county-public-health-measles-vaccine/"&gt;late January&lt;/a&gt; had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren’t getting tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think this may be very large,” she wrote in a &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf"&gt;Feb. 3 email&lt;/a&gt; to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf"&gt;another email&lt;/a&gt; what she’d learned from conversations around town: “According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that email &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/251.pdf"&gt;and others&lt;/a&gt;, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/164.pdf"&gt;One email&lt;/a&gt; asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC’s recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?” Wells wrote on Feb. 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It never hurts to ask the CDC,” said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I asked him to escalate this question to someone more qualified,” &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/163.pdf"&gt;Milton wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “Of course, we know the CDC is ‘stressed’ currently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the &lt;a href="https://immunizeusa.org/"&gt;Immunization Partnership&lt;/a&gt;, a Texas nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The CDC had gone dark,” said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. “We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn’t expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25502931-acting-hhs-secretary-communications-memo-1-21-25/"&gt;freeze on federal communications&lt;/a&gt; had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed,” one CDC scientist said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the situation was not unique to measles. “Like most public health organizations, we weren’t able to get ahold of our program people in February,” he said. Information trickled out through the CDC’s communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. “The CDC was gagged,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through private conversations, Benjamin learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/14/nx-s1-5297913/cdc-layoffs-hhs-trump-doge"&gt;lay off&lt;/a&gt; CDC staffers in droves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not that the CDC was delinquent,” Benjamin said. “It’s that they had their hands tied behind their backs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn’t need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. “We would always offer a conversation and ask if there’s anything we could do,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state’s correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records “confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That’s &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Email-State-Vaccines-To-Holbrooks_Redacted.pdf"&gt;corroborated in emails&lt;/a&gt; from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC,” Zach Holbrooks, the health district’s executive director, told KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren’t already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn’t spread measles to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in &lt;a href="https://anabaptistworld.org/texas-measles-outbreak-draws-attention-to-traditionalist-mennonite-community/"&gt;close-knit Mennonite communities&lt;/a&gt; where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn’t want to be tested, didn’t want to name their contacts, and didn’t want to talk with the health department. “It doesn’t matter what resources I have if people won’t avail themselves of it,” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against covid restrictions deepened that mistrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some &lt;a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/the-illegal-immigrants-who-love-trump"&gt;live in the U.S. illegally&lt;/a&gt;, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. &lt;a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/the-illegal-immigrants-who-love-trump"&gt;Locals guess&lt;/a&gt; the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf"&gt;far larger&lt;/a&gt; than the &lt;a href="https://demographics.texas.gov/Resources/TDC/Conference/b5dd2dd3-e840-45db-9e1d-8b450bd37c74/20230524_2020CensusUndercountEngagingTexas.pdf"&gt;U.S. Census&lt;/a&gt; count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don’t know how many people are in the community,” Holbrooks said. “There’s a lot of people in the shadows out here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health experts say the situation in Gaines sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 450 people — including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses, and volunteers — helped control a measles outbreak sparked in an Eastern European immigrant community in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9004490/"&gt;Clark County&lt;/a&gt;, Washington, in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Melnick, Clark County’s public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. “We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, hundreds of people in the city’s health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City’s assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8103967/"&gt;data from prior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33712549/"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;. Then there’s the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay6485"&gt;the lasting toll&lt;/a&gt; of some measles infections, including &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html"&gt;deafness or worse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think there’s a price tag to put on a child’s death that would otherwise be prevented,” Zucker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/401.pdf"&gt;emailed a colleague&lt;/a&gt;: “I’m so overwhelmed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A death ignites a response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 26, Texas announced that &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;a 6-year-old child had died&lt;/a&gt; of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html"&gt;brief notice&lt;/a&gt; on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/278_46af73.pdf"&gt;In emails&lt;/a&gt;, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC’s notice might exacerbate &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/science-speaks-blog/2025/talking-to-patients-about-measles-vitamin-a-and-the-importance-of-vaccination/"&gt;a problem&lt;/a&gt;: Doctors were &lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/public-health/2025-03-27/west-texas-children-treated-for-vitamin-a-toxicity-as-medical-disinformation-spreads-alongside-measles-outbreak"&gt;treating children&lt;/a&gt; with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. A local Lubbock news outlet &lt;a href="https://www.everythinglubbock.com/video/%e2%80%98its-been-flying-off-the-shelf%e2%80%99-lubbock-pharmacy-sees-more-vitamin-a-and-cod-liver-oil-purchases-amidst-west-texas-measles-outbreak/10533712/"&gt;reported on a large drugstore&lt;/a&gt; where vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which contains high levels of vitamin A, were “flying off the shelf.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10788247/"&gt;dire abnormalities&lt;/a&gt; during fetal development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups — including &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/robert-f-kennedy-jr/"&gt;one founded&lt;/a&gt; by Kennedy — that diminished the need for vaccination by &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/science-speaks-blog/2025/talking-to-patients-about-measles-vitamin-a-and-the-importance-of-vaccination/"&gt;inaccurately claiming&lt;/a&gt; that vitamin A staved off the disease’s worst outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?” Milton asked &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/278_46af73.pdf"&gt;in an email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the CDC privately fretted, too. “HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials,” one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency’s notices and alerts. “If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. We haven’t seen those babies born yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another CDC official said they’ve had to “walk a fine line” between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. “We’re providing vitamin A,” Kennedy said in an interview on &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;. “There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness,” he claimed, “against serious disease and death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://methods.cochrane.org/equity/vitamin-measles#:~:text=for%20disadvantaged%20communities-,Vitamin%20A%20reduces%20the%20risk%20of%20death%20from%20measles%20by,measles%2Drelated%20deaths%20and%20complications"&gt;studies Kennedy referenced&lt;/a&gt; were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12271920/pdf/main.pdf"&gt;seldom useful&lt;/a&gt; against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. He followed this with dangerously &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/"&gt;inaccurate statements&lt;/a&gt;. “There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year,” he said. “It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.” There is &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/"&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that measles vaccines “cause deaths every year.” Scores of studies show that the vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub5/full"&gt;doesn’t cause&lt;/a&gt; encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-jr-mmr-vaccine-fetus-b2742886.html"&gt;another interview,&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy said, “The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris.” The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-vaccines-do-not-contain-fetal-cells-thimerosal/?srsltid=AfmBOooFb-cjKAkF4bdqTZQGSfABTYTou4a103IbBEydq3cDgzmGs1xo"&gt;does not contain&lt;/a&gt; an iota of fetal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Staff are exhausted”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite national attention after the country’s first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Local hospitals are at capacity,” &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/257_bdb6df.pdf"&gt;wrote Jeffrey Hill&lt;/a&gt;, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. “The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now,” &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/260.pdf"&gt;he added.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding,” Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/104.png"&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt;, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. “Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It &lt;a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/measles-takes-root-mexico"&gt;spread to Mexico&lt;/a&gt; when an unvaccinated Mennonite child returned home after visiting family in Seminole. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen &lt;a href="https://liberties.aljazeera.com/en/mexico-grapples-with-its-worst-measles-outbreak-in-decades/"&gt;in decades&lt;/a&gt;, with at least 3,700 cases and &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/situacion-epidemiologica-de-enfermedades-prevenibles-por-vacunacion"&gt;13 deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the state of Chihuahua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then another child in West Texas &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;died of measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine &lt;a href="https://tinalexander.github.io/notes/2025/04"&gt;advisory meeting&lt;/a&gt; in late April. “There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas,” Sugarman said. “We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. “A lot of people presumed their kids had measles,” he said, “and didn’t see the need to confirm it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 18, health officials declared the West Texas &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt;outbreak over&lt;/a&gt;, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/"&gt;not to vaccinate&lt;/a&gt; their kids, worried over unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/kennedy-rfk-vaccine-panel-acip-cdc-hhs-immunizations/"&gt;on the fringes&lt;/a&gt; of the scientific establishment. For example, one of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, &lt;a href="https://x.com/RWMaloneMD/status/1908665463279677915"&gt;blamed the deaths of children&lt;/a&gt; with measles on “medical mismanagement,” &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/"&gt;without evidence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/health/trump-state-health-grants-cuts.html"&gt;$11 billion&lt;/a&gt; in public health funds earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid Lubbock’s toughest months, Wells sent &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/253.pdf"&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt; to the department’s exhausted staff. “The future is uncertain, and I know this is an unsettling time for many of us,” she wrote. “Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Ways To Optimize Your Digestion As You Get Older&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this is understandably frustrating and concerning. But experts stress there are ways to minimize any effects from age-related stomach issues. They recommend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chewing Better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better digestion begins in the mouth. “Salivary enzymes help digest starch and fat in the mouth, decreasing the GI tract’s workload,” Mutha said. “The alkaline pH of saliva also helps neutralize acid in the esophagus due to reflux and alleviate GERD symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonus: Cutting your food into smaller pieces and chewing at least 15 to 20 times per bite can help mitigate any complications associated with trouble swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulating Saliva Production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saliva production tends to decrease as we age, which can affect chewing and swallowing, Sohi said. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/en/resources/research/science-and-research-institute/oral-health-topics/xerostomia" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt;, dry mouth is twice as likely to strike when you take one or more medications daily, compared with people with no medications on their roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things like regularly using an over-the-counter saliva substitute or sipping water between bites can be helpful if dry mouth is a problem for you at mealtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating More Food That’s Plant-Based, Less That’s Processed &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to optimize digestion is to eat a diet as low in processed foods and high in plant-based diversity as possible. “Diets high in processed food can alter the gut microbiome, leading to dysbiosis,” Sohi said, an unhealthy balance of gut bacteria that’s associated with higher rates of digestive disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides keeping your gut microbiome on the rails, going plant-based is the best way to increase your fiber intake, which is crucial to the quality and consistency of your number two sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber — soluble and insoluble — is what bulks up your poop, Mutha explained. This not only makes your time on the throne more pleasant and efficient, but it also decreases the likelihood of fecal incontinence and even helps treat diarrhea by absorbing water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staying Hydrated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydration is crucial to avoid constipation, Mutha said, especially once you start upping your fiber intake. The &lt;a href="https://www.ncoa.org/article/how-to-stay-hydrated-for-better-health" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;National Council on Aging&lt;/a&gt; recommends drinking one-third of your weight in fluid ounces daily. That means if you weigh 150 pounds, then you should be drinking 50 ounces (or 6¼ cups) of water per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise stimulates the motility of the GI tract, so this can be very helpful for digestion,” Sohi said. “Lying recumbent on the couch after eating is one of the worst things you can do because not only does it not help with GI tract motility, but it can also promote acid reflux.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutha agrees and recommends walking for roughly 15 minutes after your meals to help activate your stomach and improve gastric emptying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Enough Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is a healing mechanism for the body, so not getting enough quality shut-eye — the recommendation is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;seven to nine hours per night&lt;/a&gt; — can adversely affect your gut barrier and immunity, Mutha said. Researchers are still nailing down the exact mechanisms behind how, but one theory is that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4849511/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt; leads to an increase in microscopic inflammation in the bowel that may domino into gastrointestinal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastering Your Medications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any and every medicine has GI side effects — even the ones that are prescribed for GI illnesses,” Mutha said. “Making sure you take your medications exactly as prescribed decreases the risk of side effects.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSAIDs should never be consumed on an empty stomach, for instance, while acid-suppressive medicines should be taken 30 minutes before breakfast. But if side effects happen anyway, let your doctor know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When To Check In With Your Doctor About Your Digestive Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re confident the digestive drama you’re experiencing is aging-related or a sign your lifestyle needs a revamp, “it’s important to not assume” and to “share your symptoms with your doctor anyway, as sometimes there can be a more serious underlying cause,” said &lt;a href="https://www.templehealth.org/doctors/neena-mohan" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Neena Mohan&lt;/a&gt;, gastroenterologist and assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If, in addition to persistent changes in bowel habits, you’re also experiencing trouble swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea and/or vomiting, unexplained weight loss or have noticed blood in your poop (or it looks black and tarry), it’s time for a consultation with a gastroenterologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depending on the issue, your doctor may start with bloodwork and prescribe medications or do further testing, such as an endoscopy or colonoscopy,” Attalla said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/stomach-pain-increase-age_l_650c3421e4b0e83cc0da8dcf" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636"&gt;HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But few are more of a bummer than the way our digestive system seems to lose interest in, well, digesting things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Intestinal issues can arise at any age and can become more prevalent as we age,” &lt;a href="https://providers.inspirahealthnetwork.org/provider/Sara+Attalla/1999340" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Sara Attalla;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Sara Attalla&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Inspira Health in &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/carolinekee/what-is-adenovirus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New Jersey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Roughly &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/digestive-diseases" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:60 million to 70 million Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;60 million to 70 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; are affected by digestive diseases, according to the National Institutes of Health. Some of the most common symptoms? Heartburn, bloating, abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits (as in constipation, diarrhea or even a combo of the two).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nailing down what’s causing your digestive drama can be tricky since it’s a multi-faceted problem that typically stems from a highly individual combination of aging and lifestyle-related culprits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How The Aging Process Can Affect Digestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As we age, the nerves and muscles in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can start to glitch, resulting in changes to how our digestive organs function individually and work together — usually, this translates into the digestion process itself becoming sluggish and communication signals between digestive organs getting haphazard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Movement within the esophagus and muscles involved in swallowing may not be as effective or coordinated, for instance, and can lead to higher rates of esophageal reflux (known as GERD, where your stomach contents start to make a comeback), while slower motility in the stomach can cause what you’ve eaten to linger and trigger indigestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The stomach lining can also become thinner with age, which renders you more susceptible to injury in the stomach from things like inflammation,” Attalla said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Decreased &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24411-prostaglandins" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:prostaglandin production;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;prostaglandin production&lt;/a&gt; over time (a hormone-like substance that plays a role in stomach acid secretion and GI muscle functioning) means a decrease in the protective lining of the stomach, too, leaving you more prone to gastritis and ulcers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The next stop on your food’s digestive journey is a pit stop in the small bowel. “Slower motility here can lead to higher rates of bacterial overgrowth, which can cause bloating and diarrhea,” &lt;a href="https://gastrohealthpartners.com/physicians/dr-sunana-sohi-gastroenterologist-louisville-kentucky/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Sunana Sohi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Sunana Sohi&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified gastroenterologist at Gastroenterology Health Partners in Louisville, Kentucky, told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And if motility screeches to a halt in your colon, get ready for possible bouts of constipation and diverticulosis (a condition where small sacs form and push against weak spots in the wall of your colon, putting you at risk of symptom flareups, such as bleeding and inflammation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then there’s the chronic health conditions that tend to stack up as we get older (arthritisis, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases), many of which can cause limitations to the level of movement we can tolerate, further exacerbating gut motility issues.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prenatal exposure to Chlorpyrifos in the womb disrupts brain development. Risks remain for children in farming communities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study has identified a connection between prenatal exposure to the commonly used insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and structural changes in the brain, along with reduced motor abilities, in children and adolescents living in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research is the first to show that exposure before birth can lead to long-lasting and widespread molecular, cellular, and metabolic alterations in the brain, in addition to impairments in fine motor coordination. The study, conducted by scientists at &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;Columbia University&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Columbia University is an Ivy League institution based in New York City, recognized for its excellence in medicine, law, and scientific research.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/span&gt; Mailman School of Public Health, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, and the Keck School of Medicine of &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;USC&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;The University of Southern California is a private research university in Los Angeles, known for strengths in medicine, engineering, and media studies.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;USC&lt;/span&gt;, appears in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Birth cohort study results&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis focused on 270 children and adolescents enrolled in the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health birth cohort study, all of whom were born to Latino and African-American mothers. Chlorpyrifos levels were detected in their umbilical cord blood, and they later underwent brain imaging and behavioral evaluations between the ages of 6 and 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed that higher prenatal exposure was consistently linked to more pronounced disruptions in brain structure, function, and metabolism, as well as slower motor speed and impaired motor programming. Evidence across multiple neuroimaging methods indicated that the severity of abnormalities increased directly with the level of CPF exposure, suggesting a clear dose-response effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residential pesticide use was the main source of exposure for these children. Although the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prohibited CPF for indoor household use in 2001, it continues to be applied in agriculture for non-organic crops such as fruits, vegetables, and grains. This ongoing use results in toxic exposure from outdoor air and dust, particularly near farming areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Expert warnings on vulnerable groups&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Current widespread exposures, at levels comparable to those experienced in this sample, continue to place farm workers, pregnant women, and unborn children in harm’s way. It is vitally important that we continue to monitor the levels of exposure in potentially vulnerable populations, especially in pregnant women in agricultural communities, as their infants continue to be at risk,” said Virginia Rauh, ScD, senior author on the study and the Jane and Alan Batkin Professor of Population and Family Health at Columbia Mailman School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The disturbances in brain tissue and metabolism that we observed with prenatal exposure to this one pesticide were remarkably widespread throughout the brain. Other organophosphate pesticides likely produce similar effects, warranting caution to minimize exposures in pregnancy, infancy, and early childhood, when brain development is rapid and especially vulnerable to these toxic chemicals,” says first author Bradley Peterson, MD, Vice Chair for Research and Chief of Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry at at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.&lt;/p&gt;

Using taxonomic graph analysis, researchers mapped personality from the ground up, uncovering new meta-traits and traits not captured by the Big Five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s bottom-up method highlights complex relationships between personality items, leading to a richer, more precise hierarchy. Beyond personality, this approach could also transform how clinicians classify and diagnose mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big Five Expansion:&lt;/strong&gt; The new model identified six traits, including sociability, integrity, and impulsivity, expanding beyond the traditional five.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom-Up Approach:&lt;/strong&gt; TGA builds personality structures by analyzing statistical relationships between survey items.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychopathology Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; This method could lead to rethinking diagnoses, such as reframing anxiety as a subtype of depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexander Christensen’s recent study probably won’t rewrite 40 years of history in the field of psychology, but he hopes that his research team’s quantitative approach to developing and evaluating personality structures triggers a discussion about how personality is defined and measured. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such discussion could hold broader implications for the field of personality psychology and potentially for classifications in psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christensen and his colleagues’ article, “Revisiting the IPIP-NEO personality hierarchy with taxonomic graph analysis,” was published in June in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Personality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personality surveys, informed by theoretical personality structures, are often organized in a hierarchy, and offer people a scientific understanding of who they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 40 years, the Big Five personality structure has been a highly regarded tool for creating psychological profiles. The Big Five traits are conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness to experience, and extraversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christensen, an assistant professor of psychology and human development at Vanderbilt Peabody College of education and human development, says that the Big Five structure has been a culturally robust and predictive model for personality, but he believes it can be improved using advanced data science methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common methods for understanding and measuring personality begin with the Big Five traits and connect to more refined characteristics further down in the hierarchy in a top-down, siloed approach (as shown in the structure below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach can miss important statistical relationships between items (or individual survey questions). Items are the building blocks of personality taxonomies. Understanding the relationships between them is key to developing scientifically valid structures higher up the hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new and improved approach to personality structures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In  their new study, Christensen and his colleagues apply taxonomic graph analysis (TGA), a network for measuring the relationships between psychological variables, to the IPIP-NEO personality inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using TGA as the tool for building the personality structure allows relationships to emerge from the bottom-up by making empirical connections between items to “facets” (narrow personality characteristics) to traits like the Big Five.  The quantitative power of TGA uncovers a new, more precise structure (shown below) for measuring and describing personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the research team’s new three-tiered IPIP-NEO taxonomic structure, they found three meta-traits (stability, plasticity, and the new disinhibition), six traits (neuroticism, conscientiousness, openness, and three new ones: sociability, integrity, and impulsivity), and 28 facets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application to psychopathology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Beyond personality, I think this bottom-up approach could have an impact on how we develop classifications of psychopathology,” Christensen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychopathology structures (as exemplified above) follow a similar top-down approach to personality structures. As an example of how TGA could lead to reclassification and a change in diagnoses, Christensen points to the overlapping symptoms associated with internalizing disorders, specifically depression and anxiety. They often are diagnosed together but as two distinct diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a TGA investigation of psychopathology structures might reveal two types of depression with anxiety being a component of one of these types, not a distinct diagnosis itself. If that were the case, a mental health practitioner could possibly diagnose someone with a specific type of depression, rather than with depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Christensen says, “The paper’s lasting impact will be in the value of taxonomic graph analysis and the methods we developed for investigating complex psychological structures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The importance of “team-science”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christensen credits the breakthroughs of this paper to the “team-science” approach that bridged longstanding theoretical scholarship and recent innovations in data science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lead author Andrew Samo approached me a few years ago with this idea of examining the hierarchical structure of personality, and I thought we had developed some tools that we could apply to the evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wouldn’t have been able to do this study without bringing together Andrew’s substantive and theoretical team and my quantitative team. It’s a great example of what team science can accomplish,” Christensen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you would like to take a shortened version of the survey Christensen and colleagues investigated, it is &lt;a href="https://bigfive-test.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;freely available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christensen teaches Behavioral Data Science in the Psychological Sciences Ph.D. program and Quantitative Methods M.Ed. program.

They can brainstorm ideas, draft documents, answer questions, and even help with everyday planning.

ChatGPT is an LLM-based &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-ai-chatbots/" target="_self"&gt;chatbot&lt;/a&gt; that can certainly help with a variety of tasks, but it can also sound confident even when it's wrong, sometimes producing false details or outdated info.

Diagnosing physical health issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've definitely fed ChatGPT my symptoms out of curiosity, but the answers that come back can read like your worst nightmare. As you pore over potential diagnoses, you could swing from dehydration and the flu to some type of cancer. I have a lump on my chest and entered that information into ChatGPT. Lo and behold, it told me I may have cancer. In fact, I have a lipoma, which is not cancerous and occurs in one in every 1,000 people. My licensed doctor told me that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying there are no good uses of ChatGPT &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/chatgpt-for-self-diagnosis-ai-is-changing-the-way-we-answer-our-own-health-questions/" target="_self"&gt;for health&lt;/a&gt;: It can help you draft questions for your next appointment, translate medical jargon and organize a symptom timeline so you can walk in better prepared. And that could help make doctor visits less overwhelming. However, AI can't order labs or examine you, and it definitely doesn't carry malpractice insurance. Know its limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Taking care of your mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT can offer grounding techniques, sure, but it can't pick up the phone when you're in real trouble with your mental health. I know some people use ChatGPT as a substitute therapist. CNET's Corin Cesaric found it mildly helpful for working &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/i-used-ai-to-help-with-grief-heres-what-experts-think-about-using-it-this-way/" target="_self"&gt;through grief&lt;/a&gt;, as long as she kept its limits front of mind. But as someone who has a very real, very human therapist, I can tell you that ChatGPT is still really only a pale imitation at best, and incredibly risky at worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatpGPT doesn't have lived experience, can't read your body language or tone, and has zero capacity for genuine empathy. It can only simulate it. A licensed therapist operates under legal mandates and professional codes that protect you from harm. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/ai-as-your-therapist-3-things-that-worry-experts-and-3-tips-to-stay-safe/" target="_self"&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; doesn't. Its advice can misfire, overlook red flags or unintentionally reinforce biases baked into its training data. Leave the deeper work -- the hard, messy, human work -- to an actual human who is trained to properly handle it. If you or someone you love is in crisis, please &lt;a href="https://chat.988lifeline.org/" target="_self"&gt;dial 988&lt;/a&gt; in the US, or your local hotline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Making immediate safety decisions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your carbon-monoxide alarm starts chirping, please don't open ChatGPT and ask it if you're in real danger. I'd go outside first and ask questions later. Large language models can't smell gas, detect smoke or dispatch an emergency crew. In a crisis, every second you spend typing is a second you're not evacuating or dialing 911. ChatGPT can only work with the scraps of info you feed it, and in an emergency, it may be too little and too late. So treat your chatbot as a postincident explainer, never a first responder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Getting personalized financial or tax planning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT can explain what an ETF is, but it doesn't know your debt-to-income ratio, state tax bracket, filing status, deductions, retirement goals or risk appetite. Because its training data may stop short of the current tax year, and of the latest rate hikes, its guidance may well be stale when you hit enter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have friends who dump their 1099 totals into ChatGPT for a DIY return. The chatbot simply can't replace a CPA who can catch a hidden deduction worth a few hundred dollars or flag a mistake that could cost you thousands. When real money, filing deadlines, and IRS penalties are on the line, call a professional, not AI. Also, be aware that anything you share with an AI chatbot will probably become part of its training data, and that includes your income, your Social Security number and your bank routing information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Dealing with confidential or regulated data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a tech journalist, I see embargoes land in my inbox every day, but I've never thought about tossing any of these press releases into ChatGPT to get a summary or further explanation. That's because if I did, that text would leave my control and land on a third-party server outside the guardrails of my nondiscloure agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same risk applies to client contracts, medical charts or anything covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act, HIPAA, the GDPR or plain old trade-secret law. It applies to your income taxes, birth certificate, driver's license and passport. Once sensitive information is in the prompt window, you can't guarantee where it's stored, who can review it internally or whether it may be used to train future models. ChatGPT also isn't immune to hackers and security threats. If you wouldn't paste it into a public Slack channel, don't paste it into ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Doing anything illegal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one is self-explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Cheating on schoolwork&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd be lying if I said I never cheated on my exams. In high school, I used my first-generation iPod Touch to sneak a peek at a few cumbersome equations I had difficulty memorizing in AP calculus, a stunt I'm not particularly proud of. But with AI, the scale of modern cheating makes that look remarkably tame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turnitin and similar detectors are getting better at spotting AI-generated prose every semester, and professors can already hear "ChatGPT voice" a mile away (thanks for ruining my beloved em dash). Suspension, expulsion and getting your license revoked are real risks. It's best to use ChatGPT as a study buddy, not a ghostwriter. You're also just cheating yourself out of an education if you have ChatGPT do the work for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Monitoring information and breaking news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT Search in late 2024 (and opened it to everyone in February 2025), the chatbot can fetch fresh web pages, stock quotes, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/gas-prices-hold-steady-after-iran-ceasefire-despite-dubious-8gallon-warnings-in-california/" target="_self"&gt;gas prices&lt;/a&gt;, sports scores and other real-time numbers the moment you ask, complete with clickable citations so you can verify the source. However, it won't stream continual updates on its own. Every refresh needs a new prompt, so when speed is critical, live data feeds, official press releases, news sites, push alerts and streaming coverage are still your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Gambling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've actually had luck with ChatGPT and hitting a three-way parlay during the NCAA men's basketball championship, but I would never recommend it to anyone. I've seen ChatGPT hallucinate and provide incorrect information on player statistics, misreported injuries and win-loss records. I only cashed out because I double-checked every claim against real-time odds, and even then I got lucky. ChatGPT can't see tomorrow's box score, so don't rely on it solely to get you that win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. Drafting a will or other legally binding contract&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is great for breaking down basic concepts. If you want to know more about a revocable living trust, ask away. However, the moment you ask it to draft actual legal text, you're rolling the dice. Estate and family-law rules vary by state, and sometimes even by county, so skipping a witness signature or omitting the notarization clause can get your whole document tossed. Rather, let ChatGPT help you build a checklist of questions for your lawyer, then pay that lawyer to turn that checklist into a document that stands up in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;11. Making art&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't an objective truth, just my own opinion, but I don't believe AI should be used to create art. I'm not anti-artifical intelligence by any means. I use ChatGPT for brainstorming new ideas and help with my headlines, but that's supplementation, not substitution. By all means, use ChatGPT, but please don't use it to make art that you then pass off as your own. It's kind of gross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 21:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNZGpCQVpwNGxmbkVndHVnbUw2Q1p2YlRTdUxaa2JqY19hd0YxckpCNktMTGlDWXgzNHFMRG5JUnRQM01GeExGWV9DMWlHMEdyN0dkNXl5RlZwNjNzQ0lDNDFKemFXUG9PNEdHNlJvYjcyLXluNWNNNkNfZVVEY1hUR3VQcXIyZmFhTU1obGtDNk9ZS0ZoUUlpeEYtVG1EMllBeURIMHNISFZFSFRUUlBHRzN5N2JnZ1E</guid></item><item><title>我在47岁时被诊断出患有阿尔茨海默氏症，我的生活永远改变了- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/kristatorres/this-47-year-old-woman-early-onset-alzheimers-disease-tiktok</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

  &lt;h2 class="subbuzz__header subbuzz__header--standard subbuzz__title "&gt;
    

    
      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;It was then that Staci went to her primary care practitioner with her symptoms and suspicions, and got further testing done as she shared in her TikTok. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tryingnottoforget/video/7525953178119048478" target="_blank"&gt;She also emphasized how she had to really advocate for herself.&lt;/a&gt; "I remember she said, 'Early-onset Alzheimer's is really rare at your age, but let's send you to a neurologist specializing in memory care and have you checked out.'"&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After her cognitive scores showed mild cognitive impairment in December of 2024, her doctor ordered MRIs of the brain and spine, an EEG, and more bloodwork. "This was to rule out Multiple Sclerosis, seizures, brain bleeds, tumors, and a bunch of other stuff. All of the diagnostic testing came back normal. I went back for a second neurology visit in February of 2025, and we discussed the possibility of it being ADHD, or my anxiety and depression. So she ordered a neuropsych evaluation," added Staci. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was finally able to get the blood biomarker testing after continuing to advocate and express concern about her grandmother having the disease. When the biomarkers came back high for Alzheimer's, she got the PET scan that showed widespread amyloid plaques in her brain. Luckily, insurance covered the cost of the tests for her.&lt;/p&gt;

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic, has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/22/health/covid-vaccines-rfk.html" data-link="native" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class=""&gt;delayed authorization of the fall COVID shots&lt;/a&gt; and dismissed the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local health officials say the result is confusion and dwindling supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re in an unfortunate limbo, created by an administration that’s uncommitted to vaccines, between the slow shutting down of ’24-’25 vaccine availability and access to the ’25-’26 version,” Willis said. “This is particularly concerning in California as our transmission rates continue to climb.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical organizations are breaking ranks with the administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics urged vaccination for infants and children, while the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv" data-link="native" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class=""&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; advised shots during pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both recommendations stand in contrast to new federal guidelines that limit eligibility largely to older adults and those with chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consequences are already visible.

Doctors say many patients describe a harsher sore throat than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it more dangerous?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, no. The World Health Organization says the overall risk is “low,” and evidence suggests Stratus is not causing more severe illness than earlier strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Will vaccines still work?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Experts say last year’s shots and the pending 2025-26 vaccines should still protect against severe disease, though federal delays may make access harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Do at-home COVID-19 tests detect newer variants?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, according to infectious disease experts. That’s because the antigen detected by at-home tests “has remained fairly stable even as the virus mutates and new strains of COVID develop,” Harvard Medical School instructor Dr. Michelle Chan &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-tests-do-at-home-tests-work-on-newer-variants" data-link="native" class=""&gt;said on the university’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 20:14:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQd1pjcDNZQUEyRW9QMDhCVENPT2h1T1M5bzZ3UG5USjZNeXY3LWNJRFRCNlktNFVNb2VwcWlnMXhEVlAtcmRLSzd5cnpiLURxOHpZSWtWU0prSW5FLU43a1J0THZ4QW1nOWVGXzNfdEFqMEJ1U0lmdVJ4UzVpWTdRQnhsX3pYMl9EZ0xKdXROZlZrdw</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家说，心脏病患者应该接种包括新冠肺炎在内的呼吸道疾病疫苗- PBS</title><link>https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/heart-disease-patients-should-get-vaccinated-against-respiratory-illnesses-including-covid-19-cardiology-experts-say</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-text"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;The American College of Cardiology issued new guidance Tuesday that recommends adults with heart disease get vaccinated against respiratory illnesses, including RSV, COVID-19, pneumococcal infection, shingles and influenza. Just weeks out from cold and flu season, the &lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Journal-Scans/2025/08/26/11/44/New-ACC-CCG-Consolidates-Recommendations-on-Immunization"&gt;recommendation&lt;/a&gt; marks a departure from official U.S. guidance as the Trump administration makes moves to limit vaccine access, particularly for COVID-19 shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People living with heart disease are already considered a high-risk group, “no matter what their age,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a spokesperson for the college and a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. He said vaccine-preventable infections can be more serious in people who have underlying chronic heart disease and can disrupt their care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It can cause more heart failure, and some of these infections predispose actually to heart attacks,” Schaffner said. “Of course, those are things every cardiologist would like to prevent on behalf of their patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/who-is-eligible-for-a-covid-shot-what-to-know-about-the-fdas-latest-changes"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Who is eligible for a COVID shot? What to know about the latest U.S. changes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists are urged to either vaccinate their patients themselves or to make a strong recommendation for patients to get vaccinated, the new guidelines said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates for infectious diseases like COVID have declined in recent years. In a KFF poll published Aug. 1, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/poll-while-most-adults-do-not-expect-to-get-a-covid-19-shot-this-fall-those-who-want-one-worry-about-access-and-insurance-coverage/"&gt;6 in 10 U.S. adults said they were not likely to get the updated COVID vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, a steep decline since the pandemic began five years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical societies like the ACC, the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/05/acog-statement-on-hhs-recommendations-regarding-the-covid-vaccine-during-pregnancy"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32836"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; have historically recommended vaccines to protect people against seasonal viruses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this season’s emerging set of guidelines stand out because they contradict statements from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who founded Children’s Health Defense, an organization that promotes vaccine skepticism. Kennedy has ratcheted up restrictions to vaccine access since the Senate confirmed him in February,including cutting off funding for all mRNA vaccine research and ending national recommendations that &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/cdc-removes-language-that-says-healthy-kids-and-pregnant-women-should-get-covid-shots"&gt;pregnant people and children get vaccinated against COVID&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To counter these claims, ACOG and the AAP have each offered their own evidence-based recommendations that pregnant people and children should get vaccinated against COVID to prevent the risk of severe outcomes, including hospitalization and death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how the discourse around vaccination shifts, vaccine recommendations are likely to continue moving forward, said Dr. Eduardo Sanchez, the chief medical officer for prevention at the American Heart Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanchez said he hoped that hearing another recommendation for getting vaccinated from “yet another credible science-based source of information would add that to the reasons why [people] should trust vaccines and expect that they’re going to benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has also taken steps to control, if not silence, those who have traditionally advised the government on vaccine policies and best practices. On June 9, &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/rfk-jr-ousts-entire-17-person-cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee"&gt;he fired all members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt; at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, replacing them with several vaccine skeptics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re not following the body of science at all,” said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist who also directs the Vaccine Integrity Project. Osterholm cautioned that myths and disinformation are “likely to confuse parents and consumers of vaccines.” &lt;/p&gt;

Over 10 percent of women had three or more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers relied on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a gold-standard CDC dataset that contains health data spanning from 2007 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly 34 percent of women in the study had obesity and about five percent had diabetes, while 80 percent were deficient in folate, also known as vitamin B9, a compound crucial during pregnancy for preventing birth defects of the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, nearly one in five women were shown to have exposure to nicotine in the forms of smoking, vaping, or second-hand inhalation, which has been shown in past research to significantly increase the risk of premature birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13183373/Parents-unknowingly-putting-babies-risk-suffocation-sudden-death-syndrome-simple-mistake-warns-charity.html"&gt;and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seven percent of women struggled to afford nutritious food, which led to poor nutrition for the fetus and a higher risk of obesity in the future. The study said that women facing food insecurity might also struggle to afford prenatal vitamins, eat nutritious food, or manage their weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Birth defects are common, affecting one in 33 babies, and account for about one in five &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15032523/Southern-state-emergency-infant-mortality-mississippi.html"&gt;infant deaths&lt;/a&gt;. They can range from mild, such as webbed toes or a club foot, to fatal, such as anencephaly, a condition where parts of the brain and skull don’t form, or Trisomy 13, which causes malformed organs. They are a leading cause &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15032523/Southern-state-emergency-infant-mortality-mississippi.html"&gt;of death in infants&lt;/a&gt;, accounting for about one in five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk factors researchers considered raised the risks of babies being born with heart defects, such as improperly formed valves, neural tube defects such as spina bifida, and orofacial clefts, including cleft lip and cleft palate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;A CDC study found that two-thirds of American women of reproductive age have at least one major risk factor, such as obesity, smoking, food insecurity, or low folate levels, that can increase the chance of birth defects (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the exact causes of birth defects are often unknown, scientists generally agree that a complex mix of genetic predispositions, environmental influences, and lifestyle choices is at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 25 percent of birth defects are caused by genetic or chromosomal abnormalities, including conditions like Down syndrome, which is caused by an extra chromosome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Environmental causes, such as infections in the pregnant mother, maternal diabetes, nutritional deficiencies like a lack of folate, and exposure to certain drugs account for five to 10 percent of birth defects, according to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222074/#:~:text=Genetic%20(chromosomal%20and%20single%2Dgene)%20causes,0.5%20percent%20of%20newborn%20infants."&gt;NIH.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists estimate that ‘complex genetic or unknown causes’ are behind 65 percent of most birth defects, the NIH scientists reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are not caused by a single faulty gene, but rather, a complex interplay between genes interacting with each other or a combination of genetic predispositions and unknown environmental influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study did not explain exactly how the risk factors lead to birth defects, but cited the one-carbon cycle, a network of chemical reactions in the body that uses nutrients like folate, vitamin B12, and choline to make DNA, regulate genes, and support cell growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the cycle malfunctions, such as when folate is low during pregnancy, it can disrupt DNA synthesis and cell division in a developing embryo. This increases the risk of birth defects, particularly neural tube defects like spina bifida and deadly anencephaly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists are still trying to work out how exactly the health of the mother leads to malformations in their babies&lt;span&gt;. Still, past research has shown that obesity and diabetes can &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6619680/"&gt;change how the body&lt;/a&gt; processes folate and other nutrients. At the same time,&lt;/span&gt; smoking introduces toxins that &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2556992/"&gt;interfere with folate metabolism&lt;/a&gt; and increase oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Birth defects are a leading cause of death in infants, accounting for about one in five. Non-Hispanic Black women bore the highest burden, with 80 percent having at least one risk factor versus 62 percent of white women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said: ‘Previous studies have suggested that these risk factors may be attenuated through the consumption of folic acid (FA) periconceptionally and during organogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A developing fetus needs folate to make healthy new cells as well as to make DNA and RNA. Folate is also essential for the formation of normal red blood cells and amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors recommend folic acid supplements, which are made up of the synthetic form of folate, over dietary folate alone, as they are more reliably absorbed in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women can get natural folate from a variety of foods, with the best sources being dark leafy greens such as spinach and kale, lentils and other legumes, asparagus, avocados, and broccoli. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Citrus fruits, nuts, seeds, and fortified foods like cereals and breads, which contain the synthetic form, folic acid, are also excellent sources of the key nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women who may become pregnant should take a supplement containing 400 micrograms of folic acid. But those who lack access to nutritious food are less likely to take supplements for prenatal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly seven percent of women faced severe food insecurity, meaning they regularly struggled to afford enough food. When it came to crucial prenatal nutrients, the data revealed that while about 28 percent of women took a folic acid supplement, only 13 percent were taking the recommended daily dose of 400 micrograms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ninety-nine percent of women were not getting enough folic acid from food alone, and even when supplements were included, eight in 10 still fell short of the recommended amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deficiencies were confirmed by blood tests, which showed that one in five women had folate levels low enough to increase the risk of severe neural tube defects, severe disorders in babies that occur in the first month of pregnancy, where the embryonic structure that forms the brain and spinal cord fails to close properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study found that while less than half of women in their teens and early twenties had risk factors, that number jumped to nearly three-quarters of women aged 35 to 49, mainly because the prevalence of conditions like obesity and diabetes increases with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis also uncovered stark racial and economic disparities. Non-Hispanic black women faced the highest burden, with 80 percent having at least one risk factor, compared to 62 percent of non-Hispanic white women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Non-Hispanic black women also had the highest rates of severe food insecurity and the lowest levels of folate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, women living in poverty were far more likely to have multiple risk factors compared to those with higher incomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest findings were published in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00438-6/fulltext"&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vast majority of birth defects are chronic, such as microphthalmia, which causes lifelong vision impairment; Spina Bifida, which requires a lifetime of mobility assistance, bladder and bowel function help, and potential for fluid on the brain; and Down Syndrome, which carries lifelong implications, including intellectual disability, possible heart defects, and higher risks for other health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

For one thing, women's health has only been taken seriously by the medical establishment for the past few decades; the &lt;a href="https://orwh.od.nih.gov/toolkit/recruitment/history" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;FDA wasn't even required&lt;/a&gt; to include women in clinical trials until 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there are some indications that medical reticence may be hurting men in sweeping ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.CIR.98.21.2334" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;landmark study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the American Heart Association in the late 1990s, men made up 75 percent of all sudden cardiac deaths, with men aged 45 to 75 particularly likely to die due to coronary artery disease. With symptoms like chest pain and shortness of breath as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;early warning signs&lt;/a&gt;, coronary artery disease can easily be treated if it's caught early enough — but men have to convince themselves to go to the doctor first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though heart disease remains the leading cause of death &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;among men globally&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11642101/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, prostate cancer is another major killer that could be treated effectively by regular screenings. The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;American Cancer Society estimates&lt;/a&gt; that in the US, one in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetimes — and that one in 44 men will ultimately die from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Eric Wallen, the chair of urology at Medical University of South Carolina, a lot of men erroneously believe they don't need to get prostate exams, which are indeed uncomfortable, but &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/rrrtrh/are_prostate_exams_any_worse_than_pap_smears/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;probably not much more so&lt;/a&gt; than a pap smear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think a lot of people are falling back on, 'Well, that’s not really recommended,'" Wallen told the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; his patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(According to the University of California at Los Angeles' Health system, those screenings &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/no-early-warning-signs-its-important-to-keep-up-with-prostate-cancer-screenings" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;very much &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; for all men between the ages of 50 and 55, or at age 45 if they have a family member with prostate cancer.

Using a novel molecule called FP802, researchers were able to break apart this “death complex” in mice, preventing cognitive decline, synapse loss, and mitochondrial damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment also reduced amyloid buildup, suggesting it could offer broader protection than existing therapies. While still in early stages, the findings open a promising new path for treating Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases like ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toxic Complex Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; The NMDAR/TRPM4 complex causes neuronal death and fuels Alzheimer’s progression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug Candidate:&lt;/strong&gt; FP802 disrupted the complex in mice, preserving memory, synapses, and mitochondrial health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novel Approach:&lt;/strong&gt; Targets downstream cell death mechanisms instead of directly removing amyloid plaques.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Heidelberg University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A molecular mechanism that significantly contributes to the progression of Alzheimer’s disease has been discovered by a research team led by neurobiologist Prof. Dr Hilmar Bading of Heidelberg University. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In joint experiments with researchers from Shandong University (China), the team, using an Alzheimer’s mouse model, demonstrated that a neurotoxic protein-protein complex is responsible for nerve cells in the brain dying off and the resulting cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112459"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/Alzheimers-death-protein-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/Alzheimers-death-protein-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/Alzheimers-death-protein-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/Alzheimers-death-protein-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/Alzheimers-death-protein-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/Alzheimers-death-protein-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/Alzheimers-death-protein-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/Alzheimers-death-protein-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain surrounded by proteins in a snow globe." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/Alzheimers-death-protein-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/Alzheimers-death-protein-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/Alzheimers-death-protein-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/Alzheimers-death-protein-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/Alzheimers-death-protein-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/Alzheimers-death-protein-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/Alzheimers-death-protein-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;According to Prof. Bading, this approach fundamentally differs from previous treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s disease. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the scientists, this finding opens up new perspectives for the development of effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein-protein complex, known from previous studies, consists of the NMDA receptor and the TRPM4 ion channel. NMDA receptors, which take part in signal transmission between nerve cells, are found on the surface of the cells and are present both in the synapses and outside these contact points between nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are activated by a biochemical messenger, the neurotransmitter glutamate. While the activation of synaptic NMDA receptors in the brain is critical for the survival of nerve cells as well as the preservation of cognitive abilities, TRPM4 gives the extrasynaptic NMDA receptors toxic properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together they build a “death complex” that can lead to damage as well as the death of nerve cells, explains Hilmar Bading, who directs the Institute of Neurobiology at Heidelberg University’s Interdisciplinary Center for Neurosciences (IZN).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neurotoxic NMDAR/TRPM4 complex is present at much higher levels in Alzheimer’s mice than in healthy animals, the research shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the novel pharmaceutical compound FP802, a so-called “TwinF Interface Inhibitor” discovered in previous studies by Prof. Bading and his team at the IZN, the international research team demonstrated that the NMDAR/TRPM4 complex plays a key role in the progression of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments on a mouse model, they succeeded in breaking the deadly protein-protein complex apart using this neuroprotective molecule. FP802 binds to the so-called “TwinF” contact surface through which TRPM4 interacts with NMDA receptors, thereby blocking the physical interaction between the two proteins and dissolving the complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In Alzheimer’s mice treated with the molecule, disease progression was markedly slowed,” states Dr Jing Yan, a researcher in Prof. Bading’s team who now works at FundaMental Pharma, a biotech offshoot of the IZN’s Institute of Neurobiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typical cellular changes due to Alzheimer’s disease – including the loss of synapses and structural and functional damage to mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell – developed only to a limited extent or not at all, the scientists report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive abilities such as learning and memory remained largely preserved. In addition, the characteristic formation of beta-amyloid deposits in the brain was significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Prof. Bading, this approach fundamentally differs from previous treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of targeting the formation or removal of amyloid from the brain, we are blocking a downstream cellular mechanism, the NMDAR/TRPM4 complex, that can cause the death of nerve cells and – in a disease-promoting feedback loop – promotes the formation of amyloid deposits,” states the Heidelberg neurobiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In prior studies, the team was able to demonstrate comparable neuroprotective effects of the TwinF Interface Inhibitor FP802 in disease models for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in which the NMDAR/TRPM4 complex also plays a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers therefore believe they have found in the novel inhibitor a potentially widely applicable pharmacological principle that could slow or even stop the progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and ALS. Prof. Bading reports, however, that a prospective clinical application is still a long way off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The previous results are quite promising in the preclinical context, but comprehensive pharmacological development, toxicological experiments, and clinical studies are needed to realize a possible application in humans,” stresses the scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In close cooperation with FundaMental Pharma, the neuroprotective molecule FP802 is to be optimized for this in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by the German Research Foundation, the European Research Council, the former Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the east Chinese province of Shandong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6c191809420119090000091e41080918091e182c1e090718031e0d1842190205410409050809000e091e0b420809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ute Mueller-Detert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uni-heidelberg.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Heidelberg University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ute Mueller-Detert – Heidelberg University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03143-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The NMDAR/TRPM4 death complex is a major promoter of disease progression in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Hilmar Bading et al. &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The NMDAR/TRPM4 death complex is a major promoter of disease progression in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by cognitive decline and neuronal degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The formation of amyloid β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are key morphological features of AD pathology. However, the specific molecules responsible for the cell destruction triggered by amyloid β and tau proteinopathies in AD has not yet been identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we use the 5xFAD mouse model of AD to investigate the role of a recently discovered death signaling complex which consists of the extrasynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4 (TRPM4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NMDAR/TRPM4 death complex is responsible for toxic signaling of glutamate, which has been implicated in AD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We detected an increase in NMDAR/TRPM4 death complex formation in the brains of 5xFAD mice. This increase was blocked by the oral application of FP802, a small molecule TwinF interface inhibitor that can disrupt and thereby detoxify the NMDAR/TRPM4 death complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FP802 treatment prevented the cognitive decline of 5xFAD mice assessed using a series of memory tasks. It also preserved the structural complexity of dendrites, prevented the loss of synapses, reduced amyloid β plaque formation, and protected against pathological alterations of mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results identify the NMDAR/TRPM4 death complex as a major promoter of AD disease progression, amplifying potentially self-perpetuating pathological processes initiated by amyloid β.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TwinF interface inhibitors offer a novel therapeutic avenue, serving as an alternative or complementary treatment to antibody-mediated clearing of amyloid β from AD brains.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:56:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5jenNHbnpXYzN3VzY0dk1LVlhhSzlpVWpGUGxaTXNDTXhVc3RpVlZJUFBOM3hoNURpbXA2S0xsVFBmcWs0eU9GVmNSc3hweWpyWkxseGNYX1BDMDJyVE1vOWdRYVBKWVRZb0FkM3gzOGZpWE0</guid></item><item><title>眼科检查可以在症状出现前几十年发现阿尔茨海默氏症-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/alzheimers-eye-exam-29619/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Eye exams could help detect Alzheimer’s disease years before symptoms arise.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings build on previous work from the same group at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), which found similar vascular changes in mice’s brains and linked abnormalities in specific retinal cells to early dementia risk, strengthening the case that the retina is a powerful biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re at an optometrist or ophthalmologist appointment, and they can see odd vascular changes in your retina, that could potentially represent something that is also happening in your brain, which could be very informative for early diagnostics,” said Alaina Reagan, a neuroscientist at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) who led the work with Gareth Howell, professor and Diana Davis Spencer Foundation Chair for Glaucoma Research at JAX who spearheaded the previous study.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the retina is part of the central nervous system, scientists often see it as an extension of the brain that shares essentially the same tissue. That’s why changes in retinal blood vessels can offer early clues about brain health and diseases like Alzheimer’s, Reagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your retina is essentially your brain, but it’s much more accessible because your pupil is just a hole, and we can see tons of stuff,” Reagan explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All the cells are very similar, all the neurons are quite similar, all the immune cells are quite similar, and they behave similarly under pressure if you’ve got a disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team studied mice with a mutation called MTHFR&lt;sup&gt;677C&amp;gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;, which is found in up to 40% of people. They found that the mice’s retinas had twisted vessels, narrowed and swollen arteries, and less vessel branching as early as six months of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reflects similar changes in the brain linked to poor blood flow and increased risk of cognitive decline. Vessels that appear more twisted and looped than normal can signal problems with hypertension, as the narrowing tissue limits nutrient and oxygen transport, Reagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can see these wavy vessels in the retinas, which can occur in people with dementia,” Reagan said. “That speaks to a more systemic problem, not just a brain- or retina-specific problem. It could be a blood pressure problem affecting everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, a study by the same group revealed similar vascular changes in the brains of mice with the same MTHFR&lt;sup&gt;677C&amp;gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; mutation, highlighting the link between vascular health in the retina that resembles human disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These mice have fewer vessels in their cortex and reduced blood flow to their brains,” Reagan said. “These changes are subtle, but they are there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also discovered changes in protein patterns in both the brain and retina. They found disruptions in how cells produce energy, remove damaged proteins, and maintain the structure and support of blood vessels, offering important clues about how the MTHFR&lt;sup&gt;677C&amp;gt;T &lt;/sup&gt;mutation affects the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also support a growing theory that blood vessel health plays a central role in neurodegenerative diseases, Reagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of these molecular changes are happening in conjunction, which suggests these systems in brain and retinal tissue are working in tandem,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though more studies are needed to gain a deeper understanding of how vascular health in the retina affects the risk of dementia, the new insights have important implications for people with this genetic factor, Reagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the study also captured the influence of sex and age, with female mice showing worse outcomes. By 12 months, they showed reduced vessel density and branching, highlighting progressive vascular changes. Similarly, women develop dementia more often than men, according to the World Health Organization.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see if the link between the mutation and vascular changes occurs in humans, as well as whether the new insight could be used in eye exams, the team is partnering with clinicians and dementia care specialists at Northern Light Acadia Hospital in Bangor, Maine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to study not just one cause or solution for Alzheimer’s and other dementias, as these conditions depend on many different genetic and environmental factors, but to learn more about how eye health adds to overall risk for these diseases. If the clinicians know which signs to look for, they could communicate those risk factors to patients and recommend further tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people over 50 have some kind of vision impairment and get checked annually for prescription changes,” Reagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Are they more at risk if they have these vascular changes, and is that a point when doctors could start mitigating brain changes? That could be 20 years before cognitive damage becomes noticeable to patients and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other authors are Michael MacLean, Travis L. Cossette, and Gareth R.

We examine retinal vascular health in a mouse containing the ADRD risk variant &lt;em&gt;Mthfr&lt;sup&gt;677C&amp;gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to determine if changes in retina mirror similar changes in cerebrovasculature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70501-sec-0020-title"&gt;METHODS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morphology and function of retinal vasculature and neurons were assessed using in vivo imaging, immunohistochemistry, and pattern electroretinography. RNAscope and proteomics were employed to determine &lt;em&gt;Mthfr&lt;/em&gt; gene expression and differential protein expression in mice carrying &lt;em&gt;Mthfr&lt;sup&gt;677C&amp;gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70501-sec-0030-title"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice show age- and sex-dependent retinal vascular deficits, displaying similarities to previously published brain data. &lt;em&gt;Mthfr&lt;/em&gt; is widely expressed and co-localizes with vascular cell markers. Proteomics identified common molecular signatures across the brain and retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70501-sec-0040-title"&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results demonstrate that &lt;em&gt;Mthfr&lt;/em&gt;-dependent vascular phenotypes occur in brain and retina similarly. These data suggest that assessing age and genetic-driven changes within retinal vasculature represents a minimally invasive method to predict AD-related cerebrovascular damage.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:15:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5oTnBmdjdaRzhMOGhTeVJLSUNXSlZ4TFZLbURPY0FEcVQxcWRaRUpEdzlfakhNcWVJZDRSLUhEUHQ2R0pyTmx0b29BSTJwMEhoMHo5bVgyaU1zNFhSSjBFclNFWF9uQQ</guid></item><item><title>MDH确认今年有20例西尼罗河病毒病例，明尼苏达州有2例死亡- Bring Me The News</title><link>https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/mdh-confirms-20-west-nile-virus-cases-2-deaths-in-minnesota-this-year</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bring Me The News</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:14:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNY2pfVjJzVVVfbktTT3c5ZDFhUmJvc3lRa1ZQUlZqSW5DbnlLVlZxRzdfZnZ3c0dnSGlHUVZKY095eEV3LXZtY05FaGdTQVBUa1ZEaDZUUWlsdUhMc3RfZTUtZzJYbzJEYzNWVVZ1X3MyMGdrc1FPMF83RU8zSXYyVFlPWGZtYkxzOUk4bDJhblpWMW40QjkzbEFFRENabU1KNFVyMW5ES0NpY3NFT0REVQ</guid></item><item><title>新墨西哥州男子在今年该州首例人类病例中被诊断出患有鼠疫：官员- ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/new-mexico-man-diagnosed-plague-states-1st-human/story?id=124984885</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;A New Mexico man has been diagnosed with plague, marking the state's first human case this year, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/awareness/2025/8/?view=2265" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;local health officials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The patient, a 43-year-old man from Valencia County -- located just southwest of Albuquerque -- was hospitalized with the condition but has since been discharged, the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Recently, the patient had been camping in Rio Arriba County, which borders Colorado, where health officials believe he may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;No other identifying information about the man was available, including his name or race/ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Many people think of this as a disease of the past, but in fact, it circulates in wildlife throughout the western U.S.," Dr. Erin Phipps, state public health veterinarian for NMDOH, told ABC News.

"If a person has the bubonic form of plague -- plague with that inflamed lymph node -- that can point a clinician in the correct direction pretty quickly.
