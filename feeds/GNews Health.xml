&lt;p&gt;Disorientation and confusion underpin most of the other sundowning symptoms and behaviors. As the day is ending, people may start to be uncertain and confused about what’s going on in their environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, if their family is preparing dinner, the patient might be thinking, ‘What are these people doing?’ They don’t understand the activity around preparing the meal,” Diaz said. They may also feel that they are in the &lt;a href="https://www.dementia.org.au/living-dementia/mood-and-behaviour-changes/restlessness" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7944365" data-affiliate="true"&gt;wrong place&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, they may become agitated and restless. “They might pace around or rock in the chair, things like that, where there’s visibility, an inability to relax,” Krowel said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person may become anxious, irritable, upset or aggressive. They may also have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, Diaz said. “Relatives may say they observe the patient wandering at night, because they’re not sleeping at night and reversing the day with the night.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms “present differently from patient to patient, because there is more than one form of dementia,” Diaz noted. Visual or auditory hallucinations are more common in those with Lewy body Dementia, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to learn to tell sundowning apart from delirium, though, as symptoms can appear similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delirium may mean the person is going through a condition that is critical and in some cases, life-threatening, so being able to identify its root cause is essential. “Disorientation in delirium [may mean] the patient is in a critical condition. It could be a bad infection, sepsis, a severe and sudden spike in blood pressure, very high blood sugar, or a manifestation of stroke in patients who are older,” Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main way to distinguish between delirium and sundowning is by remembering that the latter typically occurs around the time the sun is setting or at a specific time of day, whereas delirium occurs abruptly at any time of the day, Diaz explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the most part, once you find out what is causing the delirium, and treat it or get it under control, the delirium will subside,” he noted. Sundowning tends to recur, though there are ways to ease its symptoms when it does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you suspect your loved one is experiencing delirium, Krowel advised seeing your primary care physician or going to emergency care, “depending on how severe the symptoms are at the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can worsen sundowning? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

From fitness gurus to wellness experts, everyone is talking about how amazing those tiny seeds are. This superfood is undoubtedly nutritious. But one wrong step and chia seeds can land you in an emergency room. Yes, that’s right. While chia seeds are a nutritional powerhouse, there are some hidden dangers no one is talking about. Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a leading California-based gastroenterologist trained at Harvard and Stanford, explains what happens if you eat chia seeds the wrong way.

Native to Central America, they have been used for ages.

They contain healthy omega-3 fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary fiber, proteins, vitamins, and some minerals. They are also an excellent source of polyphenols and antioxidants, such as caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, myricetin, and quercetin, among others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 tbsp or 28 g of chia seeds &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170554/nutrients" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;contain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calories: 138&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 4.7 grams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 8.7 grams (including 5 grams of omega-3s)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carbohydrates: 12.3 grams (10.6 grams of fiber)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calcium: 18% of the Daily Value (DV)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magnesium: 23% of the DV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phosphorus: 27% of the DV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin B1 (thiamine): 15% of the DV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin B3 (niacin): 16% of the DV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Can chia seeds pose a danger to health? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds are good for your health, especially your gut and heart. But if they are not consumed the right way, it can be dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chia seeds are super healthy, but did you know eating them the wrong way can cause serious issues?” Dr. Sethi says in a video shared on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what’s the wrong way to eat chia seeds? Not soaking them. “You have to soak your chia seeds, or you risk this happening inside your body. I'm a gastroenterologist. People have ended up in the hospital after eating dry seeds and then drinking water. The seeds expanded and got stuck in the esophagus, and it had to be removed endoscopically. Even though it is rare, it has happened in people with swallowing issues or other GI conditions,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds can absorb water, so if you are not soaking them properly, the chances of ending up in an ER are high. “Chia seeds absorb up to 27 times their weight in water, so make sure to consume them the right way,” the doctor adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How to consume chia seeds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to consume chia seeds is after soaking them. “Soak them in water for at least 30 minutes, if not overnight. They will form a gel-like texture that is great for digestion. Start with one teaspoon and work your way up,” the gut doctor suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Most organizations are still built on assumptions of bodily reliability and linear productivity, as if everyone follows the same GPS: steady roads, predictable stops, and a straight path from the effort to output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But living with chronic and degenerative illness and distressing diagnoses is not a detour; it is a different journey altogether. The road is uneven, often unpaved, and sometimes washed out without warning. You may be rerouted mid-meeting, stalled by fatigue, overcome by pain, or the need to adjust your position or location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chronic illness often begins with invisibility that prompts others to fill in the blanks. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatigue or distraction mistaken for disinterest; pain misread as irritability; brain fog interpreted as forgetfulness; or physical adaptations branded as “weird.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/news/mom-calls-out-attendance-awards"&gt;Mom Questions The Merits Of School Attendance Awards After Her Chronically Ill Daughter Was Excluded While Her Classmates Were Gifted Chocolate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike having a broken leg, which comes with a cast and immediate sympathy, chronic conditions linger in the shadows until they disrupt what others expect of us. When presentations of “symptoms” become undeniable — missed deadlines, canceled plans, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/mind-tricks-improve-mood-according-psychology"&gt;altered moods&lt;/a&gt; — the illness becomes “seen,” but often too late or too awkwardly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this situation, compassion at work must be skilled, not sentimental. Well-meaning colleagues might say, “Feel better soon,” as if this were a passing cold, not a permanent recalibration. Unlike some other afflictions, chronic illnesses do not resolve on a schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So for those living with such chronic health conditions, like I have for decades, the challenge lies not only in the symptoms but also in managing the mismatch between external expectations and internal reality — at work, at home, and within &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-of-an-identity-crisis"&gt;one’s own sense of identity&lt;/a&gt; and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the workplace still expects everyone to arrive on time, use the same road, and pretend their journey is not more challenging, employees and precious talent will be lost. But what happens when our body no longer cooperates? How can managers support employees in these situations, and what can we all learn from those who must rearchitect their lives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I learned early in my life that I had to move through the world with a different map. Along the way, I met some people who seemed impatient when I slowed down or unkind when I diverged from norms to just get through the day — but I also met a few remarkable guides who just walked with me, without needing to know the whole story. This post is about what that journey has taught me, about work, leadership, and how we think of others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Below the water line: fragility and productivity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-09/people-with-chronic-illness-know-about-compassion.png" alt="woman with chronic illness who knows compassion" title="what people with chronic illness know about compassion" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;fizkes / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disease is part of life and the human condition. Chronic, genetic, and degenerative conditions are often invisible to others; can be progressive, episodic, or unpredictable; and require ongoing medical care, workplace flexibility, and emotional understanding. Perhaps most insidiously, they often come with stigma or disbelief — especially when symptoms are not outwardly visible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This invisibility leads many people to hide their diagnoses or downplay their needs, at the expense of their health, performance, and ability to connect to others. These conditions affect millions of people: colleagues, managers, family members, and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurological and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), epilepsy, ALS, and myasthenia gravis all impact how individuals move, speak, or think — and often unpredictably. MS alone affects roughly one million people in the United States, while epilepsy impacts over three million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn’s disease, and psoriatic arthritis are equally prevalent, with lupus affecting an estimated 1.5 million Americans and inflammatory bowel disease impacting around three million Americans. These conditions flare and recede, often without warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic and connective tissue disorders like Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (1 in 5,000), Marfan syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz Syndrome (1 in 100,000) can cause not only chronic pain, musculoskeletal deformation, exhaustion, and functional instability, but also sudden cardiac or pulmonary events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sufferers of fibromyalgia (which affects an estimated four million people in the U.S.) and chronic fatigue syndrome (experienced by 3.3 million American adults) share some of these life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endocrine and metabolic conditions — particularly diabetes and thyroid disorders — affect over 38 million and 20 million Americans, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many patients or sufferers remain underdiagnosed or misunderstood, and &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2021/the-intersection-of-mental-health-and-chronic-disease" rel="nofollow"&gt;mental health issues are frequent&lt;/a&gt;: clinical and epidemiologic evidence shows that the risk for depression is higher among those who suffer from chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add these up, and tens of millions of people in the U.S. alone (and their loved ones) are navigating &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-youre-overworked-underappreciated-every-aspect-your-life"&gt;the demands of work&lt;/a&gt;, family, and society with invisible limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/health/serious-health-conditions-linked-directly-constantly-being-stressed-out"&gt;16 Serious Health Conditions Linked Directly To Constantly Being Stressed Out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Off-roading: inflection points and identity shifts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many workers with invisible conditions carry two burdens: their own symptoms and the discomfort these symptoms cause themselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our book, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-71541-4" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compassionate Management of Mental Health in the Modern Workplace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we focused on how health challenges — especially chronic or acute illnesses — are critical &lt;em&gt;personal inflection points&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflection points affect not just how individuals feel but also how they function in all areas of life. At work, they may struggle with energy, focus, and reliability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At home, they may become dependent, altering established family roles. And they might withdraw from society because the cost of &lt;em&gt;engaging &lt;/em&gt;with others seems to outweigh the potential benefits of &lt;em&gt;connecting &lt;/em&gt;with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managers must recognize these moments not as isolated crises but as transitional phases requiring adaptive support — both emotional and structural. This does not mean lowering expectations, but making appropriate accommodations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put another way, managers here do not need to reduce standards but rather enable individuals to meet the standards and work expectations, but perhaps in new ways, until the necessary work and business of the firm can be accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflection points often hold special power because they usually entail shifts in identity: very independent people may&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/ways-you-make-world-better-when-ask-for-help"&gt; need to learn to ask for help&lt;/a&gt;, while the more resilient and stoic presenting individuals might need to show vulnerability. Caregivers become patients, providers need support, and high performers may need to downshift. These changes can cause shame, internal conflict, and silence — especially in workplaces that reward stoicism in leaders and managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, health inflection points are entangled with other stressors — financial expenses, the strain of uncertainty, and grief around losing abilities and control, and just dealing with change. For example, postpartum depression or long-term caregiving may go unacknowledged yet fundamentally affect workplace performance and family dynamics. Employees often mask these issues, which can lead to an increased emotional and physical toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When individuals fall ill, families, colleagues, and friends often absorb the fallout, which can be an additional burden on the employee struggling with illness. Their children and their partners will have to do more emotional and physical labor and may need to adjust their work schedules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this context, managers should consider how support can expand beyond the individual to encompass their context and view the entire family as the caregiving unit. The question then becomes, “How do we best go about it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/scenarios-sound-familiar-relationship-wildly-unhealthy"&gt;If These 5 Scenarios Sound Familiar, Your Relationship Is Wildly Unhealthy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When instincts take over&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The place to start is with ourselves. When confronted with an employee in distress, managers tend not to consult policy manuals immediately but instead rely on instinct, which is often based on their lived experiences, personalities, and fears. This can lead to jumping to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our book identified default &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://carinisabelknoop.medium.com/hyena-or-kangaroo-know-your-archetype-to-better-support-struggling-employees-and-yourself-58b3ea3f06c1" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;animal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; archetypes in managerial responses when mental illness issues surface in persons or in teams. They apply just as clearly to chronic illness as they do to mental health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some default to the Ostrich, practicing benign ignorance. They keep their heads down, hoping the problem will resolve itself. Their discomfort with vulnerability leads them to avoid conversations until the issue becomes unavoidable. Often, it becomes harder to manage and even harder for the employee to divulge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others become Kangaroos, carrying their struggling team member close, over-accommodating, or shielding them from challenge. While motivated by care or shared experience, this approach can disempower and demoralize the employee, who is struggling to preserve autonomy and agency, and it can destabilize the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hyena manager, consciously or not, shifts into a “protect the pack” mindset. They may sideline or pressure the unwell employee to leave, rationalizing it as being in the best interest of performance or morale. But this often communicates that being imperfect means being expendable. The Snake waits until a mistake justifies action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, we would be a Platypus, unusual, adaptive, and rare. This manager blends curiosity with care and pragmatism with perception. They listen for signals rather than stories, ask how they can help before making assumptions, and respond with flexibility grounded in structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As managers, considering the impact of chronic illness invites us to redesign for the reality of managing humans for the unpredictability and unevenness of the human body and spirit as they truly are. This is about diversity, inclusion, and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If managers and workplaces can support those of us living on altered maps, they might be better equipped for everyone navigating the detours of life we have written about over the years — be it &lt;a href="https://carinisabelknoop.medium.com/how-extending-a-hand-to-employee-caregivers-helps-them-and-the-firm-and-some-lessons-from-an-af9f31760350" rel="nofollow"&gt;caregiving&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://carinisabelknoop.medium.com/lost-in-transition-how-understanding-loss-supports-workplace-well-being-for-all-e3338cf20fcc" rel="nofollow"&gt;grief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://carinisabelknoop.medium.com/the-burnout-puzzle-the-role-of-expectations-boundaries-and-ego-c5f99d71e01d" rel="nofollow"&gt;burnout&lt;/a&gt;, parenting, neurodiversity, or plain exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/family/bride-uninvites-chronically-ill-sister-wedding"&gt;Bride Wonders If She's Wrong For Uninviting Her Chronically Ill Sister — 'I'm Sick Of Her Stealing The Spotlight'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to lead when the map has changed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting employees with chronic illness means redesigning systems with variability in mind. Sometimes, productivity, like health, comes in waves, not on fixed timelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than asking employees to explain or justify their conditions, managers can focus on listening for signals: subtle shifts in behavior, energy, or engagement that may indicate the need for adjustment. When someone says they need to work differently, the most helpful question is, “How can we support that?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, organizations have not always been successful in building career paths that accommodate rerouting, for example, for employees who are parenting and caregiving. Employees may need to pause, slow down, or shift directions entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also important to remember that individuals disclose when the environment feels safe, not when they are told to “bring their whole selves to work.” Today, for the most part, most of us feel that we can bring our whole selves to work as long as we present as healthy. Asking someone to “just be honest” is cruel if honesty costs them their career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaders can help by modeling imperfection themselves and being transparent about the tradeoffs of high performance. Insufficient leave, lack of flexible scheduling, and persistent stigma around health-related vulnerability hinder employees’ ability to recover and contribute. Even when laws exist (e.g., the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Pregnancy Discrimination Act), cultural signals often suppress help-seeking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/art-letting-go-habits-naturally-tranquil-people"&gt;The Art Of Letting Go: 3 Simple Habits Of Naturally Tranquil People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The gifts of a wounded traveler&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chronic illness can limit what we do on a given day, it often expands &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we do it and how we see others doing it, too. The workplace tends to frame illness in terms of risk: absenteeism, lowered output, and cost. However, like neurodivergence, experiencing and managing chronic conditions can also cultivate capacities that align with what teams and leaders supposedly need the most today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illness sharpens time awareness and forces prioritization. Many of us become &lt;em&gt;radically organized&lt;/em&gt; because we have no choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When energy comes in limited units, we learn to protect it, map it, allocate it with care, and triage what matters, what can wait, and what needs help. And who needs help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illness also strips away pretense. It makes us &lt;em&gt;vulnerable&lt;/em&gt; for sure, but not fragile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It teaches us to ask for help, to receive support, and to notice subtle cues in others. These are core leadership skills: humility, attunement, and relational intelligence. In managing a body that betrays expectations, we become more aware of what others are carrying and more willing to accommodate differences without demanding explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And perhaps most powerfully, chronic illness often deepens empathy. We may be short-tempered sometimes because we are in physical and mental pain, but we will also be more empathetic and understanding of others presenting with differences. We may become more patient with these differences, more skilled at navigating ambiguity, and more courageous in trying to reach out to address the imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, chronic illness teaches us that change and life are not always gradual, fair, or predictable. It allows us to lead and support others with greater sensitivity, especially in times of organizational transition, personal loss, or systems in flux. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, your body works the way you expect. The next, it does not.  And in that reckoning, many of us must develop comfort with uncertainty, navigating life with less entitlement and more realism and resilience. Not everyone gets what they need and want. Not everyone starts from the same baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illness makes visible what is true for many marginalized people at work and in society: that effort and outcome are not always proportionate. What is “equal” on paper may not be equitable in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as organizations are learning to recognize the assets of neurodivergent talent — such as pattern recognition and creative thinking — they must also learn to recognize what employees with chronic illnesses bring. Like caregivers who feel supported and understood, we can also bring perspective, focus, and loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/simple-habits-people-refuse-shame-themselves-practice-every-single-day"&gt;5 Simple Habits People Who Refuse to Shame Themselves Practice Every Single Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Driving with pain in the passenger seat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those living with conditions like mine, the path is not broken, but it is different. If you manage or love one of us, please understand this: Some of us are always driving with pain in the passenger seat, bad shocks, or blurred mirrors — and sometimes, we look out for death approaching in the rearview mirror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/signs-man-doesnt-love-just-loves-fixing-you"&gt;are not asking to be rescued or fixed&lt;/a&gt;. We are asking for room to move forward, in the ways that we still can, perhaps sometimes sideways, and be accepted as we are. Still capable and very human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And perhaps special in different ways, too. To extend our metaphor, chronic illness changes not only the map, but also the travelers. And in that change, we may discover paths worth following, not just for ourselves but for everyone seeking their way. I have tried to do just that while trying to befriend my own companion in the passenger seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/health-wellness/what-its-like-live-chronic-pain-daily-basis"&gt;What It's Like To Live With Chronic Pain On A Daily Basis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carin-Isabel Knoop leads the Case Research &amp;amp; Writing Group at Harvard Business School, contributing to over 2,000 global case studies—she remains undeterred, not just about writing but also about making workplaces better.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-ozempic-and-why-are-people-saying-its-a-sad-way-to-lose-weight"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; medications have been working wonders in terms of shedding pounds for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/are-weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-for-you-consider-these-risks-and-benefits"&gt;many people&lt;/a&gt;, but a study shows that they're still not as effective as surgery when it comes to weight loss – and it's not even close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from New York University (NYU) compared &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sleeve-gastrectomy/about/pac-20385183"&gt;sleeve gastrectomy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/gastric-bypass-surgery"&gt;gastric bypass&lt;/a&gt; operations against semaglutide or tirzepatide. These drugs are known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1&lt;/a&gt; (GLP-1) receptor agonists, because of the way they mimic the natural GLP-1 hormone, which &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-reshapes-the-kinds-of-food-people-eat-heres-what-happens"&gt;controls appetite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using health records, the team matched people who had taken one of the weight loss drugs with people who had undergone either of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"&gt;bariatric surgery&lt;/a&gt; operations, based on age, body mass index, and blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-in-a-pill-clinical-trial-finds-oral-semaglutide-works-for-weight-loss"&gt;Ozempic in a Pill? Clinical Trial Finds Oral Semaglutide Works For Weight Loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: people in the surgery group shed an average of 25.7 percent of their total body weight over two years, while those in the medication group lost 5.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's partly down to patients not sticking to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-vs-supplements-dietitian-reveals-truth-about-glp-1-imitations"&gt;their GLP-1 drugs&lt;/a&gt;, whereas surgery is more permanent, but the researchers also noticed smaller differences over shorter time frames – the surgery always gave the best results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165321" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165321" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-642x428.jpg" alt="Ozempic Isn't Actually The Most Effective Option For Weight Loss, Scientists Confirm" class="wp-image-165321 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165321" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Semaglutide mimics the body's natural GLP-1 hormone.

GLP-1 patients may need to adjust their expectations, adhere more closely to treatment or opt for metabolic and bariatric surgery to achieve desired results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that the study was funded by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS), who would have a vested interest in promoting surgical options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers aren't outright dismissing semaglutide treatments, which also showed beneficial results in this study. With &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-coverage-of-and-spending-on-glp-1s/"&gt;GLP-1 prescriptions doubling&lt;/a&gt; from 2022 to 2023, it's crucial to investigate how they compare to established &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/as-well-as-weight-loss-studies-find-bariatric-surgery-also-lowers-the-risk-of-developing-cancer"&gt;surgery methods&lt;/a&gt;, and to figure out which options are best for each individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs remain much more popular than surgery, but people &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.57349"&gt;don't often&lt;/a&gt; stick to taking them. Meanwhile, only a small percentage of people eligible for surgery choose it as an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss isn't the only benefit that can come from Ozempic. The drug was originally approved to treat type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="174929" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, because it helps lower blood sugar levels, and studies have shown it can also reduce &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-and-similar-drugs-lower-cancer-risks-study-suggests"&gt;the risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-could-be-good-for-your-heart-even-if-you-dont-lose-weight"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;. In this study, bariatric surgery was associated with even better blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174931" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174931" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RaspberryAndSugarOnSpoon.jpg" alt="A spoonful of white sugar with a raspberry on top" class="size-medium wp-image-174931" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RaspberryAndSugarOnSpoon.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RaspberryAndSugarOnSpoon-578x415.jpg 578w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RaspberryAndSugarOnSpoon-600x431.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174931" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Bariatric surgery was associated with better blood sugar control compared to semaglutide.

Though safe, the procedures are invasive, permanent, and still require patients to stick to strict diet and exercise routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In future studies we will aim to identify what healthcare providers can do to optimize GLP-1 outcomes, identify which patients are better treated with bariatric surgery versus GLP-1s, and determine the role out-of-pocket costs play in treatment success," &lt;a href="https://asmbs.org/news_releases/head-to-head-study-shows-bariatric-surgery-superior-to-glp-1-drugs-for-weight-loss/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Karan Chhabra, a bariatric surgeon at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2025.04.008"&gt;was presented&lt;/a&gt; at the ASMBS annual meeting 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was first published in June 2025&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            Relentless coughing echoes through the Mumbai suburb of Govandi, where families live cramped under tarpaulin and salvaged wood. The narrow lanes are waterlogged and airless, and here in India’s financial capital, a deadly disease is lurking at every door.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00023b6n25b91lcs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors on the ground estimate that tuberculosis has infiltrated almost every second home of this eastern urban compound, killing residents and robbing many families of their livelihoods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00033b6nnu1zmfao@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The local crisis is a microcosm of a national health care crisis. India is home to 27% of the world’s TB cases and records an average of two deaths related to the infectious disease every three minutes, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00043b6nbvychuyw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The government has pledged to eliminate the disease by the end of this year – but experts say that goal is dangerously out of reach – with health care system gaps and socioeconomic barriers stalling efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00053b6nvjzjc39w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mehboob Sheikh was diagnosed with TB six months ago – more than a decade after his wife died of the disease. For him, the realities of living with it are far too real.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00063b6n8bthxau0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I have lost a lot of weight, I can barely walk now, and I get breathless if I speak more,” he told CNN, his gaunt face and hollow eyes symptoms of his plight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00073b6nopspmjmb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The disease has already cost him his job at a printing press – the relentless fatigue and weakness left him unable to cope with the long shifts on his feet. Sheikh has been on an extended nine-month course of antibiotics, but with just three months of that treatment left, his body is still frail. Any sign of a recovery is hard to see.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00083b6nhyumxvhz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His children – malnourished, vulnerable and too young to understand – hover around while he coughs.

            Once earning 15,000 rupees ($171) a month, he now struggles to pay their school fees.

            In 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stunned global health circles by pledging to eliminate TB by 2025 – five years ahead of the WHO’s global target. Elimination means cutting new TB cases by 80% and deaths by 90% compared with 2015 levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000d3b6nh0lwb48s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts viewed the government’s 2025 target as a monumental challenge, and just months ahead of the deadline, TB remains one of India’s most stubborn public health crises.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000e3b6n90u00ghl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            India’s struggle with the disease, experts say, is fueled by a potent combination of biology, poverty and systemic health care gaps.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000f3b6n2mc2lbdo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are a high-burden nation,” said Dr. Lancelot Pinto, an expert in lungs and the respiratory system, in Mumbai. “We do not necessarily have all the resources in place to scale up and eliminate TB by 2025.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000g3b6nxr7na6qa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The bacteria that causes the disease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has haunted humanity for millennia, with traces found in Egyptian mummies. It can remain dormant inside the body for years and develop resistance to drugs, making it difficult to eradicate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000h3b6nozzip998@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The disease thrives in India’s densely populated, impoverished pockets, where people have little access to consistent medical care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000i3b6ntri1juga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After 10 years working in Govandi, health worker Pramila Pramod says the number of TB patients she sees every month has remained the same.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000j3b6nh3zbqmrj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The suburb’s alleys create the perfect transmission pathway, with no cross-ventilation, open drains clogged with garbage, and families of six huddled in single rooms. Fear of social stigma means some patients hide diagnoses from neighbors, schools, even spouses.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000k3b6nhu2fc6a0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sometimes there is a young girl of marriage age. (Her) parents won’t tell anyone she has TB,” said Pramod, who volunteers at Alert India, a non-governmental organization that works with people affected by infectious diseases. “How will they find a boy for her otherwise?” she recalls them asking.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000l3b6njsmvsc8m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This vulnerability is exacerbated by a struggling health care system where the public sector is plagued by decades of underinvestment, staff shortages and outdated facilities. The country’s vast but unregulated private sector, while providing essential and crucial services, can be costly to access.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000m3b6nv7km97cp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            India’s diagnostic strategy is another major hurdle. Nearly three-quarters of diagnoses still depend on sputum microscopy, a method first introduced around 140 years ago, that can miss active cases. The more modern molecular tests – which accurately detect the bacteria’s DNA – are used in a little over 1 in 4 diagnoses, according to Pinto.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000n3b6nbvt13dwn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This gap means countless infections go untreated and dangerous, drug-resistant strains spread undetected. “So, unless we detect and treat proactively – not just wait for symptoms – we’ll continue to miss cases,” Pinto said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000p3b6ntnifxi4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chest aches, fevers, debilitating headaches and chills pained 15-year-old Sufiya Syed for more than a year before doctors finally diagnosed her two months ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000q3b6nnq484e2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As TB took over her body, her weight dropped from 88 pounds to 55 pounds (40 kilograms to 25 kilograms). During that time, she still went to school. Now, she says she can’t focus on her studies, with nausea and sleepless nights leaving her body struggling to battle the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000r3b6ntw3j99uh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Every day when I wake up, I feel like I am going faint and completely black out,” she said. “Sometimes I don’t have food for four or five days. My mom forces me to eat.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000s3b6n2yrc9y47@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The government has ramped up efforts by offering free TB testing and medicines through public health facilities, aiming to ensure early diagnosis and treatment, reaching even the most vulnerable populations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000t3b6ngjxjn6zs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some progress has been made.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000u3b6nadcynh42@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            India has reduced cases by 17.7% since 2015, nearly double the global average decline, and deaths have dropped from 28 to 22 per 100,000 people, according to data from India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000v3b6nv2r0lbc9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But with just months to go until the government’s end-of-2025 deadline, its promise is unraveling.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000w3b6nxp9i5k89@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Major challenges, including a shortage of staff to maintain comprehensive treatment, vulnerability in mapping in high-risk areas and poor health-seeking behavior, have allowed the disease to persist, according to a 2023 parliamentary report on the government’s eradication push.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000x3b6nxsvxr7r7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Covid-19 pandemic worsened matters. Lockdowns halted screenings, disrupted medicine supplies and diverted health workers, the report said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000y3b6nl16v3vmh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CNN has contacted the Indian government’s Directorate General of Health Services for a response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00103b6n4vsf2ofq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For years, diagnosing TB in India’s remote communities has been a losing race against time, where vast distances to clinics, a chronic shortage of radiologists and a reliance on outdated sputum tests meant infections festered undetected, often until they were dangerously advanced.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00113b6ncv194mpp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since 1998, USAID filled some of the gap in India’s TB fight, channeling more than $140 million to fund grassroots networks in the nation’s hardest-to-reach corners. But recent US funding cuts have threatened to unravel these hard-won gains.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00123b6nfbtjat3n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While not publicly acknowledging the shortfall, India has boosted domestic budgets and is deploying an arsenal of new tools, including AI-powered X-rays, mobile testing vans and drones ferrying samples.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00133b6nli72jkte@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to speed up the fight against TB. Tools like Qure.ai’s chest X-ray software can rapidly scan lung images and flag patients who may have active TB – a critical step in countries where trained radiologists are scarce.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Confirmatory tests that analyze sputum or detect TB at the molecular level are more accurate, but they require labs, equipment, and time – resources often unavailable in slums and rural India. Integrated in portable machines, AI-powered X-rays help bridge that gap by flagging potential TB cases, allowing health workers to quickly refer those patients for confirmatory tests, reducing delays that often cost lives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00153b6nqeeo2gll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health experts caution, however, that the scans do not diagnose TB or reveal whether the disease is drug-sensitive or drug-resistant. Instead, they function as a screening and triage tool – catching cases earlier, reducing the number missed by basic symptom checks, and ensuring that patients are referred for proper sputum or molecular testing before starting treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00163b6nro7o5snn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That speed and reach matter in India, the world’s most populated country, where crowded living conditions make early detection crucial to stopping the spread of TB.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00173b6nvuibursv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These machines weigh less than 3.5 kilos and can be carried in a backpack,” said Qure.ai’s chief medical officer for global health, Dr. Shibu Vijayan. “They run on batteries, so you can screen an entire community in one day without needing power.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00183b6nlt45xe4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The devices are making it easier to reach people who might otherwise fall through the cracks. In the capital Delhi, for instance, the Clinton Health Access Initiative has deployed more than 30 backpack-sized machines in harder-to-access areas, and hundreds more across the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00193b6n9e5jzzf0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know that certain groups are most vulnerable – slum dwellers, migrant workers, people exposed to dust,” Vijayan said. “The tiny X-rays make it possible to offer them tests in their community settings.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q001a3b6ngls770iy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cost is another breakthrough: the portable units are half the price of traditional hospital X-ray machines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q001b3b6ny50fj4ly@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Indian government has embraced the approach, incorporating AI screening into its national strategy. It has performed nearly 5 million X-rays with the devices, according to Vijayan, and officials are procuring additional devices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q001c3b6nm5o1pxzz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Having the target and getting things aligned is as important as meeting the deadline itself,” Pinto said. “As long as it’s leading us in the right direction, we should consider these small victories as victories and push harder.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q001d3b6n64z38t63@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But for people like Sheikh, there is little to celebrate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q001e3b6nor5mnipq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He continues his free treatment at a government hospital every month, with his son helping to bring his medicines home. But the help ends there. He says he has not received any monthly cash assistance that TB patients qualify for as part of a federal government program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q001f3b6now2jbajq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No one has come to help us,” he said. “I have no money left. I have to support and feed myself while I am alive.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

And I'm far from alone - creatine has become the supplement of choice for millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Originally known for enhancing the performance of bodybuilders and athletes in the 1990s, this white powder is now entering the spice cupboards (well, that's where I store mine) of women in their 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It's arguably one of the world's most researched supplements. Thousands of studies have been carried out over the past few decades evaluating its ability to increase muscle mass and overall strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Creatine has become so big, you feel that if you are not using it, you are kind of losing out," says Dr Henry Chung, a lecturer in sport and exercise science at the University of Essex. "It's moved from elite sport into the mainstream. It's not about whether to take it anymore, it's about when to take it - before or after exercise? Everyday? How much?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"In which form is best? Powder, tablets, gummies?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Creatine is a naturally occurring compound which is stored in our muscles, and helps our cells produce energy. It is a vital component in the ATP-CP system, the fastest, most powerful energy system in our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It fuels the first 10-20 seconds in high intensity workouts - giving that quick, powerful burst of energy. From lifting weights to sprinting round the track, research suggests &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28615996/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;creatine supplementation can help improve performance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;And away from the gym, there is a growing, but still relatively limited, body of evidence to suggest it can also help with our&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39070254/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt; short-term memory, mood and focus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Creatine supplements have become popular across different sports&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;So, can this supplement improve our ability to think, remember and respond?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;And for me, and many others, will it help clear our brain fog, a catch-all term that describes an inability to think clearly, string a sentence together, and remember the simplest of things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For some people with serious post-viral conditions, brain fog can be longer term and potentially life-changing. If you have concerns, it is best to seek medical help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For most, brain fog is usually temporary and can happen because of an illness or certain types of medical treatment. For millions of women, it can be a symptom of the perimenopause, due to hormonal fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Katie Mansell believes creatine has helped in many parts of her life. The 46-year-old from Merseyside lifts weights, runs 30-40 miles a week, has a full-on job as the chief financial officer of a software company, and a busy home life with a teenage son and two dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"A few months ago, I was out of sorts. I was finding training really hard work and I was struggling to focus on things," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It was my friend who recommended it - she said it was a game changer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Katie, who is also perimenopausal, started taking six grams of creatine a day three months ago, and is beginning to feel a difference. Her mood feels a bit lighter, she can lift heavier weights and the fog that had descended on her brain has started to lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I've got more motivation to do things, especially when it comes to training. I feel stronger when I'm lifting and bouldering, and I can also think more clearly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Katie does caveat this - she's also on magnesium supplements and has started on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), but she's confident that creatine is making an impact and will continue with her daily dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Katie Mansell says she has felt herself become stronger since she started taking creatine three months ago&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;There are others who believe it's made little difference and there is divided opinion on whether the majority of us get the amount of creatine we need through our diets. Katie, who is a vegetarian, says she was probably missing out. While it's understood our bodies produce one gram of it naturally, the rest comes from high-protein food like meat and fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The supplement's impact on male athletes has been documented since the early 1990s but, as with a lot of scientific research, female biology was missing from the equation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I used to have to guess what my female athletes needed," explains Dr Susan Kleiner, a high-performance nutritionist from the US state of Washington. "All the research was based on men."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It wasn't until a few years ago that women's hormonal fluctuations were taken into account, says Dr Kleiner, an adviser on the board of Creatine Health, a global initiative set up to promote research on the supplement. "And that was when scientists started to see a real impact in other parts of the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Instead of just concentrating on how creatine interacts with our muscles in a sport setting, scientists have begun to discover how it could potentially affect reproductive health, bone health and brain function - all of which can be affected during perimenopause, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;So does that mean that creatine can help my brain fog?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"That's an interesting thought," says Professor Emeritus Trevor McMorris. "It might do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Having been in the field for more than 40 years, he has carried out many studies into creatine supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He says perimenopausal brain fog could have a similar impact to sleep deprivation, something he has researched extensively, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16416332/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;finding that high doses of creatine could mitigate the effects of too little sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;When people use the supplement, the brain may - like other muscles in the body - increase its stores of creatine. This helps produce more energy, which could help improve memory and the ability to process information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But Prof McMorris say it won't work for everyone. His most recent research suggests &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432824001384?via%3Dihub=" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;people need to be under a level of stress&lt;/a&gt; - for example, being sleep deprived or not having enough creatine in their diet - for it to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;So, in short, when it comes to helping me with my brain fog - maybe - there's potential. The experts I have spoken to believe it's an "an exciting time" in this line of research, but that more studies are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Dietician Lucy Upton warns that we could start to see more side effects to creatine use because of the supplement's surge in popularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"While there is extensive research, that has been in a controlled environment," she says. "Now we need to think about the variation of body sizes, doses and any pre-existing conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Currently, known side effects are the risk of stomach upset, muscle cramps and bloating. People with conditions affecting their kidneys should consult a doctor before taking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;While Dr Chung sees no harm in healthy adults "trying it out", he also says results tend to be "minimal gains", adding that "it is not, by any means, a wonder drug".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;As for me, I started taking the creatine in my cupboard but stopped after a month (blame it on the brain fog). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Perhaps I'll give it another try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 23:02:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1IcmwtaGltcHhLVFNfYW01WnBEUjJIcFVRRks3UlV1a1RCRVRveU9FRUxoR2puMEpjQzFTUW9lVGtmZ0Y3NU9tVFp0Y29GOUxseno0SVg5aVB1d9IBX0FVX3lxTE9helltajhEQk1wSzZQSjhvcmVJZG5QMG5TUGs4NkpSYkdiQTN6cjh5UVV5aWUwMGFsTnVfQ2ZINkx2Y0N5M290R2pxYWx5RG5zRHhvQVA0OXF3R2I4OC1Z</guid></item><item><title>36岁的爸爸揭示了延误其严重癌症诊断的常见错误-以及他最初忽略的症状- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/dad-36-reveals-common-mistake-211337793.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Man holding stomach (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 36-year-old husband and father was diagnosed with cancer after he thought he simply had a case of food poisoning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Duggan said he thought his symptoms would “just go away” — but finally sought medical treatment after “about a month”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors ultimately discovered a 4-inch tumor in Duggan’s bowels, and he required surgery and six months of chemotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 36-year-old man with a wife and young child thought he had a case of food poisoning — but it &lt;a href="https://people.com/ali-feller-cancer-diagnosis-11811145" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:turned out to be cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;turned out to be cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathew Duggan of Tasmania, Australia, noticed a change in his bowel habits in February 2024, per the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/health/article-15105907/Fit-young-dad-36-reveals-common-mistake-delayed-cancer-diagnosis-doctors-insisted-serious.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daily Mail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; He told the outlet that he began experiencing diarrhea but “thought it would just go away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duggan said the symptom “dragged on” for “about a month,” adding, “then I started to feel pain, and eventually I noticed blood in my stool. That's when I finally called the doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His doctor initially reassured him that it was “nothing serious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duggan recalled, “Because of my age, I was told it would probably&lt;a href="https://people.com/youre-more-likely-to-get-hemorrhoids-if-you-use-phone-on-toilet-11803559" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:just be hemorrhoids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; just be hemorrhoids&lt;/a&gt; or polyps. Cancer wasn't on the radar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a colonoscopy revealed that he had a 4-inch cancerous tumor in his bowel — news that he never expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Heart monitor (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At 36, you're focused on work, family, your little girl. Cancer just doesn't cross your mind,” Duggan told the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duggan had surgery on the tumor in May 2024. He then underwent &lt;a href="https://people.com/colon-cancer-180-chemo-treatments-mom-facing-her-end-11703601" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:six months of chemotherapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;six months of chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt;, which he said was the most grueling part of the process due to the neuropathy pain the treatment caused in his lower extremities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The neuropathy in my feet got so bad that there were times I wanted to cut both my legs off. It felt like someone stabbing the bottoms of my feet constantly — pins and needles, burning, just unbearable pain. I couldn't walk from the bed to the fridge. Some days I couldn't go to work. It was the worst pain of my life,” he recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said that he and his wife chose not to tell their then-3-year-old daughter about his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She [my daughter] didn't come with me to the hospital or see me during chemo. We didn't want to expose her to it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Patient in hospital (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, “She only knows the positives now — &lt;a href="https://www.bowelcanceraustralia.org/story/matts-story/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the fundraising we've done;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the fundraising we've done&lt;/a&gt;, the support we've had from the community. She's been my biggest little supporter without even knowing what I was going through.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duggan also said he opted to keep his diagnosis a secret from many people in his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn't want my life to change. I didn't want people coming up to me all the time, asking how I was, looking at me differently because I had cancer. I just wanted to get on with treatment quietly and try to keep things normal,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duggan told the outlet he began seeking community in &lt;a href="https://people.com/using-social-media-during-breast-cancer-diagnosis-8729206" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cancer support groups;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cancer support groups&lt;/a&gt;, which made him feel less alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a relief to finally see I wasn't the only one. That helped lift a weight off my shoulders,” he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the advice he hopes to impart to others after his experience with diagnosis and treatment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your body tells you when something's wrong. Don't wait. Don't let anyone dismiss it because of your age. If I had ignored it any longer, it could have been too late,” Duggan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, Duggan ran more than 300 miles over 12 days as part of a &lt;span&gt;“Do It For Cancer&lt;/span&gt;” fundraising event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m wanting to create awareness around bowel cancer, especially in young people, as every health professional I’ve seen across my journey told me that I’m too young to have [it],” he wrote on the fundraising page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continued, “I want to make young people aware of the symptoms and to get checked as early as possible to stop young people dying from this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearch.org/blog/colorectal-cancer-awareness-month" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cancer Research Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cancer Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) among young people are on the rise, with 20% of those diagnosed now under the age of 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there has been “a consistent annual 2% increase in cases among adults ages 20-39,” since the mid-1990s. Experts believe the increase is related to more sedentary lifestyles, as well as “an increased consumption of processed foods and red meat,” per the Institute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/dad-36-reveals-common-mistake-that-delayed-his-serious-cancer-diagnosis-11814158" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 21:22:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9UcWxEYm1ueHZQOG96RWU5MzBiVkNIb0Fja0ZzaVdKU3hUX1ZZWVhhejRiZ2dRSHFRTDNlTUJRcTVaRkl1ajRZX3l1bGZTOEo2Qy11WHYtVWxyWjYtblNLZ3c1TmZ2eHkzbWFhQzdYakNWMTNpREQ5aFRwQW5vUQ</guid></item><item><title>医生对巨型婴儿出生上升背后的原因发出警报-无聊的熊猫</title><link>https://www.boredpanda.com/worrying-reason-behind-surge-in-women-giving-birth-to-giant-babies/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

Simply freezing food is not what makes it less healthy — some leading health organizations say frozen food is actually as nutritious as fresh. Specific nutrients in food are even better preserved when frozen. The key difference to look for when considering buying frozen food is the nutritional content of the food item and any potential additives, and to steer clear of unhealthy frozen foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frozen fruits and vegetables are typically healthy on their own, but it’s best to avoid items like pizzas, snacks, or entrees that contain a lot of added sugar, sodium, or high-calorie sauces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a closer look at some frozen foods to avoid putting in a shopping cart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red Baron Classic Crust Four Cheese Pizza&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Red Baron&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first blush this frozen pizza looks okay — but there are four servings within, and Melissa Morris, a University of Tampa nutrition professor, says many people will eat at least half the pizza, for just under 800 calories, 18 grams of saturated fat, 1500 milligrams of sodium, and 8 grams of sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you eat the entire pie, you can figure 1,600 calories, 36 grams of saturated fat, and 3,000 mg of sodium,” Morris says. A better alternative would be to make your own pizza using a thin whole-grain or cauliflower crust, less cheese, and adding vegetables of your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hungry Man Selects Classic Fried Chicken&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Hungry Man&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris describes Hungry Man dinners as a nutritional no-no, but the classic fried chicken meal, in particular, is a bad choice. “It has 940 calories, 12 grams of saturated fat, 1,370 mg of sodium, and 14 grams of sugar,” Morris says. “Did you guess that your fried chicken had 3.5 teaspoons of sugar in it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better alternative is preparing a grilled chicken breast and veggies, which would be much healthier and provide far more nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Jimmy Dean Meat Lovers Breakfast Bowl&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Walmart&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This breakfast bowl serves one person and has 460 calories, 13 grams of saturated fat, 1,130 milligrams of sodium, and 1 gram of sugar. “That much sodium is a terrible start to your day,” Morris says. “Instead, have an omelet made with veggies of your choice and low-fat cheese.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Any’tizers Boneless Chicken Bites, Honey BBQ Flavored&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Tyson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boneless chicken bites with honey and barbecue sauce sound good, but Bart Wolbers, researcher and chief science writer for &lt;a href="https://www.alexfergus.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alexfergus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alexfergus&lt;/a&gt;, suggests consumers review the ingredients before buying. A partial list includes brown sugar, sugar, corn syrup, canola oil, dextrose, high fructose corn syrup, modified food starch, polysorbate 80, smoke flavor, sodium benzoate (as a preservative), and sodium phosphates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As you can see, &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; different types of sugars are added,” says Wolbers, who has a master’s degree in clinical health science. According to the packaging, each 3-ounce serving (roughly the size of your palm, so just a few bites) contains about 7 grams of sugar, not to mention 510 milligrams of sodium (21% of the recommended daily allowance).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tombstone Original Pepperoni Pizza&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;TombStone&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, take a gander at the ingredients before buying, Wolbers suggests. “I count 38. For those specializing in nutrition, that’s a horrible list, let alone the average person walking through a supermarket.” The list includes salt, sugar, and what Wolbers calls toxic vegetable oils, such as soybean and corn oil, which are not heat-stable. There’s also yeast, different types of meat (pork, chicken, and beef), artificial flavorings, and preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more ingredients included, the higher the reward for your brain becomes — and the greater the addictive potential,” says Wolbers. Each serving of the pizza (which is a quarter of the pie) contains 17 grams of fat and 780 milligrams of sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stouffer’s Macaroni &amp;amp; Cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;goodNes&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macaroni and cheese should be simple, including perhaps two to four ingredients such as macaroni, cheese, milk, and maybe some salt, Wolbers says. But Stouffer’s version is more complicated, which is why the sauce alone is in the double digits, and each 1 cup serving contains a whopping 920 grams of sodium, 17 grams of fat, and 350 calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Again, there are at least two different cheeses added, which makes the food more rewarding to your brain. Then there’s salt, wheat flour, and two different oils added — butter and soybean oil, to make your brain go wild,” Wolbers says. “By simply adding a few highly rewarding ingredients, food companies ensure that the next time you see this macaroni and cheese product in the supermarket, you’ll buy it again instead of a healthier alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Jamba At Home Smoothies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Jamba&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who’s ever made a smoothie knows they’re sweet enough without adding sugar or stevia to the mix, says Jamie Hickey, a personal trainer, nutritionist, and founder of &lt;a href="https://x.com/truismfitness?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Truism Fitness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Truism Fitness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Jamba juice didn’t get the message,” says Hickey of the company’s overly sweet smoothies, which included added sugar. “You’re better off making a drink from scratch using unsweetened frozen produce like berries, pineapple, and spinach. This way you have total control over what you eat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hungry-Man Selects Mesquite Flavored Classic Fried Chicken&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Hungry-Man&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meal consists of fried chicken in a tangy mesquite sauce, mashed potatoes with butter, green beans, and a brownie. While we may feel &lt;a href="https://www.cheapism.com/frozen-tv-dinners-we-miss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nostalgia over frozen TV dinners;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nostalgia over frozen TV dinners&lt;/a&gt; like this, it also contains a whopping 1,050 calories per serving and 72 grams of fat, which is more fat than you should have in an entire day, Hickey says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sugar content is 18 grams, mostly from the brownie, and last but definitely not least is the 2,060 milligrams of sodium.” The American Heart Association recommends no more than 1,500 milligrams of sodium daily for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Marie Callender’s Cheesy Chicken &amp;amp; Bacon Pot Pie&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Marie Callender’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approach this pot pie, with its doughy crust stuffed with creamy sauce and bacon, with caution, Hickey says. It contains more than 60% of the recommended daily allotment for sodium. “The nutrition facts are split into two [servings], which is a trick to make it seem healthier,” Hickey says, “But the majority of people are going to eat the whole meal, and it has 1,020 calories and 64 grams of fat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pillsbury Toaster Strudel&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Pillsbury&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only are these pastries void of any nutrients a body needs to fuel up for the day, but they also include high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil, a fat that has been &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30005920" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:connected to fast weight gain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;connected to fast weight gain&lt;/a&gt;, Hickey says. “Not to mention that you should never buy a product that boasts having 30% more icing,” he adds. “You would be better off eating a breakfast casserole you make yourself, or an egg white omelet with cottage cheese and fruit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each pastry also contains 10 grams of sugar, almost half of the maximum amount of added sugars recommended by the American Heart Association for women and nearly a third of the recommended amount for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stouffer’s Bowl-FULLS Spicy Italian Sausage Pasta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Stouffer’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This product’s packaging highlights that it’s made with real cheese and contains a lot of protein. “Both statements are true, but it still doesn’t take away from the fact that this is a highly processed bowl of meat. It contains 660 calories, 1,270 milligrams of sodium, 12 grams of saturated fat, and 9 grams of sugar,” Hickey says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sara Lee Chocolate Crème Pie&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Sara Lee Desserts&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sweet, chocolate dessert comes in at 450 calories, 18 grams of saturated fat, 320 milligrams of sodium, and 32 grams of sugar. “That’s like spooning eight teaspoons of sugar into your mouth,” Morris says. “This is for one-fifth of the pie, which is not a large piece.” Instead, consider having chocolate pudding made with low-fat milk or sugar-free chocolate pudding. Or better yet, have fruit for dessert, Morris says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Evol’s Gluten-Free Mac &amp;amp; Cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Target&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evol’s Gluten-Free Mac &amp;amp; Cheese is an excellent example of a frozen food that’s marketed as healthy but is actually quite bad for you, says Dr. Nikola Djordjevic, of LoudCloudHealth. “For starters, it contains 23 grams of fat, and 14 grams of the worst kind – saturated,” Djordjevic says. The meal’s smoked flavor comes from liquid smoke flavor and other additives. For a healthier version of mac and cheese, try making it from scratch at home with fresh ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Jimmy Dean Pancakes and Sausage on a Stick&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Kroger&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do we really need pancakes and sausage on a stick? Unusual serving approach aside, this food item contains some alarming ingredients, says Nate Masterson, health expert and the head of natural product development for Maple Holistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It contains BHT, which is a possible carcinogen, not to mention the very high saturated fat and sodium levels,” Masterson says. There are 410 milligrams of sodium in a serving, as well as 3.5 grams of saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stouffer’s Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Stouffer’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meal meant for one person, Stouffer’s Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo includes a relatively small portion of chicken with noodles and Alfredo sauce. One serving contains 540 calories and 31 grams of fat, as well as 940 milligrams of sodium and 43 grams of carbs. “None of those numbers are healthy, and the amount of food you receive isn’t big enough to satiate the average person,” Hickey says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bob Evans Sausage, Egg, &amp;amp; Cheese Burrito&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Walmart&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 8 grams of saturated fat in this sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast item is more than half of what a person eating a 2,000-calorie diet needs in a day. The 810 milligrams of sodium is more than half of the 1,500 milligrams daily limit recommended by the American Heart Association, and is particularly bad for individuals at higher risk of heart disease, Morris says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kellogg’s Special K Flatbread Sandwich Sausage Egg and Cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Safeway&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like the Bob Evans burrito, this item has a significant amount of sodium — 700 milligrams. It also contains 3 grams of sugar, which includes 2 grams of added sugar. “Two grams of added sugar is like sprinkling half a teaspoon of sugar on your sandwich,” Morris says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fast Fixin’ Chicken Nuggets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Fast Fixin’&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nutrition label for Fast Fixin’ Chicken Nuggets doesn’t set off immediate alarms: Each serving of six nuggets includes 180 calories, 11 grams of fat, 510 milligrams of sodium, 13 grams of carbs, and 9 grams of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have two concerns, though,” Hickey says. “A lot of processed chicken products use fillers to cut down on the amount of chicken used, to save money in the manufacturing process. Also, once you look closer at the serving size, you see that the six nuggets weigh 75 grams. That means that these are more like popcorn chicken than they are nuggets, and you won’t be satisfied for very long — and you’ll be eating more and adding even more calories to your day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Banquet Meatloaf Meal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Walmart&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meatloaf dish includes nearly a full day’s worth of sodium at 1,350 milligrams. The  11 grams of added sugar aren’t insignificant either, Morris says, being “almost three teaspoons of sugar sprinkled on your meatloaf meal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Banquet Salisbury Steak Meal with Mashed Potatoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;H-E-B&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Banquet’s meatloaf meal, the brand’s Salisbury steak has a hefty 11 grams of added sugar. And don’t overlook its staggering 1,340 milligrams of sodium. You get nearly an entire day’s sodium in one meal with this steak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Healthy Choice Café Steamers Frozen Dinner Sweet &amp;amp; Sour Chicken&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Walmart&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy Choice is supposed to be, well, healthy. But this meal contains 22 grams of sugar — pretty much the entire daily recommended intake of sugar for a woman, according to the American Heart Association. For men, the recommended limit is 37.5 grams, so this one meal is about 60% of a day’s allotment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bottom Line: What to Look for When Buying Frozen Foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;ljubaphoto/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to buy frozen prepared foods, compare nutrition panels to buy items with as few ingredients as possible. An ingredient list should look like “Ingredients: organic spinach.” Or this: “Ingredients: organic tomato sauce, vinegar, salt.” Simple is good. “You should also &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what you’re putting into your body,” Wolbers says. “If you don’t understand what you’re eating, then don’t buy the product.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More Smart Grocery Tips From Cheapism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;RossHelen/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 17:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTFB6Qi1KWHlIUlFKdEdMOHV5dXVjdEZIYkNCZ3JkZmVnUjJzM1FlMTRIMXA2aTlIa1hZQUxNdWJmcEl2My1BbXdXSW1YTVdjb2hwRmZDZS1iY0RWbTFwVkwzdU44ZERWSENnbE8tQXpZLWVYVURBQ2tlaA</guid></item><item><title>将这种常见成分添加到饮食中可以改善记忆力并降低阿尔茨海默氏症的风险-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/adding-this-common-ingredient-to-diet-can-improve-memory-and-reduce-alzheimers-risk/articleshow/123999769.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, ways to prevent or slow Alzheimer's disease has been a concern among scientists. AD is the most common form of dementia, which affects 60 to 70% of the 57 million dementia patients globally, as per WHO. Medications for this disease have had limited success. Families of Alzheimer patients often went hopeless. But now a fascinating study has offered a glimmer of hope. The findings concluded that this common ingredient can reduce Alzheimer risk and improve memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Researchers found that Alzheimer’s disease doesn’t just affect the brain, but it also disrupts the gut-immune system. Researchers discovered that feeding the mice high-fiber diet enriched with inulin helped restore gut immune balance. Even though the brain plaques were not consistently reduced, the mice showed fewer signs of frailty, reduced tremors and improved overall health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Fiber could result in a breakthrough as this study explored a less-explored relation between the gut and Alzheimer’s. Here are some points that explain why fiber matters: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Restores gut-immune balance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, in Alzheimer’s, immune cells in the gut can migrate towards the inflamed brain. This leads the gut to become weaker. Fiber, especially inulin, can help replenish these gut immune cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Supports the Gut-Brain Axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber nourishes microbes that produce molecules that communicate with the brain. These molecules called short-chain fatty acids communicate with the brain and may protect neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Accessible Intervention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber can be a practical tool for supportive care as it is easy to consume through diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Reduces Systemic Inflammation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is a major driver of AD and accelerates neurodegeneration.

Evidence points to the biggest gains appearing at seven to ten portions daily, with diverse, colorful diets offering even greater benefits. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five-a-day was never meant as an ideal, and research now shows ten portions of fruit and vegetables daily give the best health outcomes. Practical adjustments can help make higher intakes achievable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has sparked debate by labeling the well-known &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/food-drink/article/jamie-oliver-interview-eat-yourself-healthy-79929gfcb" rel="nofollow"&gt;five-a-day guideline “a lie.”&lt;/a&gt; In an interview with the Times, he argued that the real health advantages of fruits and vegetables only become significant at seven, eight, or even 11 portions daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is correct that higher intake leads to greater benefits. Studies consistently show that the more servings of fruit and vegetables people consume each day, the more their overall health improves. However, the choice of five portions as the standard recommendation was never about representing the optimal amount but rather a balance between scientific evidence and what public health experts believed was practical for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Widespread message, limited impact&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/5-a-day/why-5-a-day/"&gt; five-a-day initiative&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in the UK and Ireland more than two decades ago, it was never intended as the “ideal” goal. Rather, it was a compromise, chosen to&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/jan/20/medicineandhealth.publichealth1"&gt; balance&lt;/a&gt; scientific evidence with what public health experts believed people could reasonably achieve. Researchers and campaigners agreed that five portions offered a simple, memorable, and approachable target that would not discourage the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five-a-day guideline has become one of the most familiar public health campaigns, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nbu.70023"&gt;yet the majority of UK adults still fail to meet it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, however, researchers argue that this message may need to be revised, as mounting evidence links greater fruit and vegetable consumption with a reduced risk of chronic illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyw319"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of over 2 million people found that while five portions lowered risk of chronic diseases such as &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_ddcf7f284a2646184c83f1121cfd78b0" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/span&gt; and cancer, the greatest benefits were seen at around ten portions of fruit and veg daily. Another &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2013-203500%22%22"&gt;UK study&lt;/a&gt; found that people eating seven or more portions of fruit and veg each day had a 42% lower risk of death compared to those eating less than one portion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellence rarely comes from doing the bare minimum – and the evidence suggests we should be aiming higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has long recommended ten (and more) portions of fruit and vegetables a day. Mediterranean countries, too, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.14778"&gt;traditionally eat diets&lt;/a&gt; rich in fresh produce, beans, and legumes. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/61.6.1402s"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that populations that follow these dietary patterns tend to have lower rates of heart disease and longer life expectancy. Similar associations between higher intakes of fruit and vegetables and lower risk of death from any cause are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxac136"&gt;reported in Japan&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Understanding portion size&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research is clear: higher intake of fruits and vegetables every day brings tangible health benefits. So while five portions is a good starting point, aiming to include more fruits and vegetables into your daily diet will bring even greater health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some confusion lies in what a “portion” really means. The World Health Organization defines &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet"&gt;one portion as about 80g&lt;/a&gt; – roughly a handful. That could be an apple, two broccoli spears, three heaped tablespoons of peas, or half a tin of beans. When you break it down like this, eight to 11 portions across three meals and snacks becomes less intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also many easy ways to add more fruit and veg every day. For breakfast, try adding berries to your cereal, a banana to your porridge, or spinach in your omelette. For lunch, add salad to sandwiches, beans to your soup, or extra veg into wraps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double up portions at dinner by eating two or three sides of veg, or bulk up sauces and curries with lentils, peppers or mushrooms. Snack smart by reaching for fruit, veggie sticks with hummu,s or roasted chickpeas instead of crisps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should also aim to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27134061"&gt;eat a rainbow&lt;/a&gt; of different fruits and vegetables across the week, as variety is associated with even greater health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Beyond five-a-day&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2025.105517"&gt;common myth that only fresh fruit and vegetables count&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, frozen, tinned (in water or natural juice) and dried all have a place. They can be cheaper, last longer, and often retain just as many nutrients as fresh produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juices and smoothies count too – but only as &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/5-a-day/5-a-day-what-counts/"&gt;one portion a day&lt;/a&gt; because of their sugar content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five-a-day message is a starting point, but not the finish line. Anything is better than nothing – and if you’re eating just one or two portions now, getting to three or four is progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the science is clear: more really is better. Jamie Oliver may be ambitious in suggesting 11 portions, but he’s right that aiming higher could bring big health gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drugstores are ready to deliver updated COVID-19 vaccines this fall and insurers plan to pay for them, even though the shots no longer come recommended by an important government committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, vaccine advisers picked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. declined to specifically recommend the shots but said people could make individual decisions on whether to get them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendations from the advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention require sign-off by the agency’s director, but they are almost always adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those recommendations normally trigger several layers of insurance coverage and allow drugstores in many states to deliver the shots. But insurers and government officials have said coverage will continue, and several states have allowed for vaccine access through pharmacies, the most common place to get shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people start seeking vaccinations in the late summer or early fall to get protection against any winter surges in cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a closer look at the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-insurers-cover-these-shots"&gt;Will insurers cover these shots?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many are expected to do so, but you still may want to check with yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services said Friday that the committee vote “provides for immunization coverage through all payment mechanisms.” An HHS spokesperson said that includes Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, commercial coverage sold through health insurance marketplaces and the federal Vaccines for Children program, which pays for roughly half of childhood vaccinations in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VFC program normally automatically covers any vaccines recommended by the CDC committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade group America’s Health Insurance Plans said earlier this week that its members will continue to cover the shots at no cost to patients through 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That group includes every major insurer except UnitedHealthcare. And that insurer has said it will continue covering the vaccine at no cost for its standard commercial coverage, which includes plans offered for individuals and through small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One caveat: Large employers that offer coverage will make their own decisions on the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They may be motivated to continue coverage: The vaccines can help ward off expensive hospital bills from people who develop a bad case of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-people-can-get-vaccinations"&gt;Where people can get vaccinations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two-thirds of adults get COVID-19 shots at pharmacies, and around 30% receive them at doctors’ offices, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to the shots has grown after &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-access-limitations-645d64cee13664840fc9a39ff2d309c0"&gt;a clunky start&lt;/a&gt; to vaccine season that saw some people travel to nearby states when they couldn’t make appointments at pharmacies closer to home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugstore chains like CVS say their locations are stocked with the latest vaccines, and they now are able to deliver vaccinations in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Prescriptions are required in D.C. and a handful of states, including Florida and Georgia, CVS Health spokeswoman Amy Thibault said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walgreens also requires prescriptions in a few states, a company spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-can-get-the-shot"&gt;Who can get the shot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, the U.S. has recommended yearly COVID-19 shots for everyone age 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-covid-shots-fda-kennedy-pfizer-children-9ce19908ae7afb354732aa162fd28532"&gt;recently approved&lt;/a&gt; the shots for all people age 65 and older, and for younger adults and children with conditions that put them at high risk for catching a bad case of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC maintains &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/risk-factors/index.html"&gt;a long list&lt;/a&gt; of conditions that would put someone at high risk, including asthma, cancer, heart or lung problems, obesity, depression and a history of smoking. It also includes those who are physically inactive, and the agency notes that this list is not conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients can consult with their doctor or care provider to decide whether they are high risk if they don’t have a condition on that list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both CVS and Walgreens representatives say their companies will ask patients under age 65 if they have any of these factors. They won’t require proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In simplest terms, if a patient says they’re eligible, they will get the vaccine,” said Thibault, the CVS Health spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;The alarm pierced through the darkness at 4:30 AM, and for the first time in weeks, I didn't want to throw my phone across the room. This wasn't how it started. Six months ago, I was convinced that waking up before dawn was just another Silicon Valley productivity cult, a badge of honor worn by CEOs who confused exhaustion with excellence. I'd read the articles about Tim Cook's 3:45 AM emails and thought: this is exactly what's wrong with our culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here I was, sitting in my doctor's office on a Tuesday afternoon in November, watching her eyebrows climb higher as she reviewed my test results. "These numbers," she said, turning her computer screen toward me, "I honestly didn't expect this kind of improvement."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey to that moment began with a panic attack in a grocery store parking lot. It was March, unseasonably warm for Boston, and I'd just finished another fourteen-hour day at my marketing firm. My heart hammered against my ribs as I gripped the steering wheel, convinced I was dying. The ER doctor who saw me three hours later was less dramatic in his assessment: chronic stress, poor sleep hygiene, borderline hypertension. "You're thirty-four," he said, scribbling prescriptions. "This shouldn't be happening yet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That word—yet—haunted me. It implied inevitability, as if declining health was just another item on adulthood's checklist, somewhere between mortgage payments and watching your parents age. I filled the prescriptions but couldn't shake the feeling that I was treating symptoms, not causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother called me the next week, her voice crackling through a poor connection from Kerala. When I told her about the panic attack, she laughed—not unkindly, but with the bemused affection of someone who'd watched the world complicate itself unnecessarily. "Beta," she said, using the term of endearment from my childhood, "you've forgotten how to live with the sun."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounded like mysticism, the kind of thing she'd say about turmeric or oil pulling. But something in her words lodged in my brain. I'd been living against the sun for years—blackout curtains, blue light until midnight, coffee at 3 PM to push through the afternoon crash. My circadian rhythm wasn't just disrupted; it was in full revolt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research I dove into that night was hardly revolutionary. Scientists have known for decades that our bodies operate on roughly 24-hour cycles, influenced primarily by light exposure. What surprised me wasn't the science but how thoroughly I'd ignored it. I was metabolically jet-lagged, living in a timezone my body didn't recognize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, 4:30 AM seemed extreme. The popular narrative around early rising felt tainted by hustle culture, by the implicit message that rest was weakness. I'd interviewed enough burnt-out entrepreneurs to know that waking up early often meant working more, not living better. But what if that was the problem—not the hour itself, but what we did with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experiment began with rules. No work emails before 8 AM. No screens for the first hour. No treating this like another productivity hack to optimize myself into a better capitalist cog. This was about something harder to measure but easier to feel: presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first week was brutal. My body, accustomed to its 11 PM bedtime and 7 AM alarm, staged a rebellion. I'd wake at 4:30, stumble to the kitchen, make tea, and sit in a stupor wondering what I'd done to deserve this self-imposed torture. By 2 PM, I was practically hallucinating from exhaustion. My colleague Sarah found me once with my head on my desk, drooling slightly onto a creative brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But something shifted in week two. I started going to bed at 8:30 PM—laughably early by any social standard. Friends mocked me. Dinner invitations required negotiation. I became the person who left parties during the appetizers. Yet for the first time in years, I was getting eight full hours of sleep. The math was identical to my old schedule, just shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those dark morning hours took on an almost sacred quality. Without the option of scrolling through emails or social media, I was forced into activities I'd claimed to never have time for. I read books—actual books, not articles skimmed between meetings. I journaled, badly at first, then with increasing honesty about fears I'd been too busy to acknowledge. I stretched on my living room floor as the city slept around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By week three, I ventured outside. Boston at 5 AM was a different city entirely. Empty of its usual chaos, it felt like walking through a movie set before the actors arrived. I started running—slowly, embarrassingly, but consistently. The Charles River path, usually packed with cyclists and tourists, belonged to me and a handful of other early risers who nodded knowingly as we passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical changes came first. Despite running less than two miles a day, my body began to transform. Not dramatically—this wasn't a fitness magazine transformation—but subtly. My shoulders dropped from their permanent position near my ears. The persistent tension headaches that had been my companions for years gradually faded. I stopped needing the afternoon coffee that had been propping up my days since college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was the mental shifts that surprised me most. That precious buffer of time before the world's demands crashed in created space for something I'd lost: clarity. Decision fatigue, that modern plague of endless small choices, seemed to dissipate when I had already accomplished something meaningful before most people's alarms rang. By the time I arrived at work, I'd already lived a small, complete day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleagues noticed. "You seem... different," Sarah told me over lunch one day. "Less wound up. Did you start meditating or something?" I had, actually, though not in any formal way. Those morning hours had become a kind of moving meditation, a rhythm of small rituals that quieted the constant chatter in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work changes were unexpected. I'd feared that leaving the office by 5 PM to maintain my new sleep schedule would hurt my career. Instead, the opposite happened. The focused morning hours made me more effective during traditional work time. Projects that would have stretched into evening hours got completed by mid-afternoon. My creativity, no longer strangled by exhaustion, actually improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months in, I scheduled my annual physical, the one I'd been postponing since the panic attack. The nurse who took my vitals did a double-take at the blood pressure reading and took it again. "That's quite an improvement from your last visit," she said, scrolling through my chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Dr. Martinez entered the room, she was prepared for the usual lifestyle lecture—eat better, exercise more, manage stress. Instead, she found herself looking at blood work that told a different story. Cortisol levels had normalized. Blood pressure was down fifteen points. Inflammatory markers had decreased. Even my cholesterol, stubbornly high since my twenties despite a reasonable diet, had dropped into healthy range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What changed?" she asked, genuinely curious. When I told her about the 4:30 AM experiment, she leaned back in her chair. "You know, we tell patients to get enough sleep, to exercise, to manage stress. But we rarely talk about when these things happen. The timing might be more important than we realize."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She pulled up a recent study on her computer about circadian rhythm and metabolic health. Early morning light exposure, it turned out, didn't just affect sleep. It influenced everything from insulin sensitivity to cognitive function. By aligning my schedule more closely with natural light patterns, I'd accidentally stumbled into a practice humans had followed for millennia before artificial light made any schedule possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what the productivity articles don't tell you: waking up at 4:30 AM is deeply inconvenient for maintaining a social life. Dinner parties became impossible. Late-night conversations with friends in different time zones required careful planning. Dating was particularly challenging—explaining that you need to leave by 8 PM doesn't exactly scream "spontaneous and fun."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned to navigate these challenges, sometimes imperfectly. Weekend schedules could shift slightly later. Special occasions warranted exceptions. But the framework held because the benefits had become too valuable to abandon. This wasn't about becoming a morning person—a term that implies an inherent trait rather than a chosen practice. It was about recognizing that when we do things matters almost as much as what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most profound change was one I couldn't measure in blood work or productivity metrics. Those dark morning hours had given me something I didn't know I'd lost: sovereignty over my own time. Before the world could stake its claims—before the emails and meetings&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

But a new study from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centre, published in Nature Metabolism, has raised a serious red flag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01368-w" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;glucose-fructose mix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found in these drinks directly fuels the spread of colorectal cancer. What makes this alarming is that these drinks are consumed not only by adults but also by children, often without much thought about their hidden dangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The hidden ingredient&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most sweetened beverages are made with a combination of glucose and fructose. While glucose and fructose individually have their own effects on metabolism, this study highlights that it is their combination that poses the most deadly risk. Researchers observed that when cancer cells were exposed to this mix, they became more mobile, spreading faster to the liver, a common site for colorectal cancer metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was not seen with glucose or fructose alone. The unique combination triggers a biological chain reaction inside the body that accelerates cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How sugary drinks trigger cancer spread&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that the glucose-fructose mix activates an enzyme called sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This enzyme, in turn, boosts glucose metabolism and switches on the cholesterol-making pathway, which becomes a driving force for cancer cells to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pathway activated is the same one that common heart drugs called statins are designed to block. When researchers suppressed SORD in preclinical models, the cancer spread slowed down, even when sugary drinks were still present. This discovery not only explains why sugary drinks are dangerous but also opens the door for new treatment approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why this study stands out&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, sugary drinks were linked to cancer risk mainly through obesity. The logic was simple, more sugar leads to weight gain, and obesity increases cancer risk. But Dr Jihye Yun, lead author of the study, had earlier shown that even moderate intake of sugary drinks directly fuels tumor growth, independent of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research builds on that evidence and shows how the sugar mix doesn’t just start cancer but also makes it far more aggressive once it develops. It underlines the reality that dietary habits matter not just in prevention but also in how diseases behave in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for everyday life&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings carry a heavy message: drinks marketed as refreshing, energising, or even “healthy” when packed with glucose and fructose can fuel deadly diseases. Children sipping on packaged fruit juices, teenagers hooked to sodas, and adults depending on energy drinks are unknowingly feeding the exact ingredient that can accelerate cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also suggests that reducing sugary drink intake should be part of public health priorities, especially as colorectal cancer is becoming more common even among younger people. The possibility of repurposing drugs like statins for treatment is being studied, but prevention through dietary choices remains the first line of defence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is not meant to spark fear but to spark awareness. Beverages may seem harmless because they are part of everyday culture and are tied to celebrations, comfort, and quick refreshment. But the evidence now shows that something as simple as choosing water, fresh fruit, or unsweetened drinks over sugar-laden beverages could make a big difference in protecting health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. If such a widely consumed ingredient is now proven to accelerate its spread, then small dietary shifts today could mean life-saving outcomes tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is based on findings from a study conducted by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and published in Nature Metabolism.

&lt;p&gt;The panel, in the end, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/19/cdc-vaccines-acip-changes-hepatitis-b-schedule/"&gt;postponed its most controversial vote&lt;/a&gt; and made recommendations that seemed aimed at fostering doubts about the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/21/mrna-vaccines-safety-efficacy-senate-committee-probe-myocarditis-adverse-events-covid-shots/"&gt;Covid-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; while still keeping them widely available. But some presenters and panelists raised concerns that the mRNA Covid vaccines – the ones made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech – may have unconfirmed safety issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In particular, Retsef Levi, who chairs ACIP’s working group on Covid vaccines, raised concerns that mRNA, the lipid nanoparticles they are encapsulated in, and the spike protein the vaccines produce may all persist and be widely distributed in the body. He also said they may provoke an immune response that is not understood and could even change the way the body reads its own genetic material. Moderna and Pfizer said that the claims were refuted by well-done studies that met global regulatory standards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;STAT posed questions about these claims to Drew Weissman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and co-recipient of the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for his discoveries that enabled the creation of mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines. That conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the ACIP meeting, there were a lot of discussions about reports of mRNA being widely distributed in the body or persisting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you look in the literature you can find papers that say that the earth is flat, you can find papers that say DNA isn’t double stranded. You can find anything. The problem is there’s thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of other papers that refute that.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;What these people do, is that they search, they find one paper or two papers that make an outlandish claim based on bad data that hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of other papers refute, they don’t mention everything that refutes it. They only mention, oh, look, I found a paper that says spike is around for nine months! It’s just not true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many good studies have not seen that. The RNA is gone in days. It doesn’t go to the brain. It doesn’t go to the eyes. What those studies did is they put huge doses of RNA into a mouse and used very sensitive assays, and that’s where it went. It goes everywhere. If you put a vaccine equivalent dose, you see it in the muscle, you see it in the draining lymph node, and that’s about it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But how certain are we that mRNA is not continuing to produce spike protein? For instance, the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.18.25322379v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;preprint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; authored by Akiko Iwasaki, which includes well respected Yale researchers. That’s a paper that found at least residual spike protein.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem is they used a bad assay to measure spike. It’s an ultra, ultra-sensitive assay, but it makes a lot of errors, and you don’t believe anything unless it’s above a certain level as real. What they reported was in the unknown area where it could just be noise in the assay versus real spike. Many other assays using good experiments, using good assays, don’t find spike protein circulating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(&lt;em&gt;In late August, Iwasaki told STAT: “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have already done two different orthogonal approaches to measure spike proteins thus far but are now working on developing more sensitive and accurate methods to further validate our findings.”)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How sure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;are you? How sure are you that there is no case of mRNA being distributed more widely in the body?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I know it’s not distributed widely. I mean, we showed that back in 2017 at vaccine doses. We’ve looked at mice, we’ve looked at macaques, we’ve looked at rabbits, and we’ve done as much as we could on humans at a vaccine dose. You don’t see RNA circulating in the placenta, in the testes, in the heart, in the eye, in the brain, all the places that they list. We and many others have looked and we just don’t see it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the mRNA could not be persistent? Could one dose of mRNA continue to make spike protein for months in a rare patient?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It is absolutely impossible. MRNA is degraded incredibly rapidly. When you modify it, it’s a little slower. It’ll last 24 hours. It never, ever lasts six months. That’s just impossible. But I can make an assay that gives you any answer you want, and that’s what these people have done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’d like to read specifically from the concerns about mRNA vaccines made by Dr. Retsef Levi, the chair of the working group for ACIP. We covered his concern about “wide biodistribution and prolonged persistence of spike, mRNA and nano-lipid particles.” He also wrote that there are prolonged immune responses that are not understood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;In people who are vaccinated, it was incredibly rare to see that. It was mostly immunized mice. You can always find people who react differently. You can always find people who don’t respond, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another concern is a “frame shift leading to production of unintended proteins and related immune response,” meaning the vaccine has changed the way that DNA is read to make proteins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was one paper that claimed that uridine caused a frameshift mutation and induced immune responses. It was never seen in thousands and thousands of other studies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the issue of DNA contamination — that DNA impurities are present at too high a level and that the lipoprotein that allows the mRNA to get into cells could lead to them being taken up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just about every vaccine has DNA contamination. If it is made from eggs, if it is made from living cells, if it is an inactivated virus, if it’s a live virus. They’re all grown in cells and cells have DNA. So when you purify the virus, you get very low levels of DNA contamination. We’ve never seen an adverse event. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And these are minute amounts. For mRNA, the DNA strands are a couple of nucleotides long. We’ve never seen them integrate into the chromosomes or cause cancer, it just hasn’t been seen. People give a milligram dose of DNA plasmid as a vaccine, it’s in clinical trials right now. We don’t see any adverse events from that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else you’d like to say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What concerned me more from these meetings is they voted against combined childhood vaccines. They voted against making Covid-19 vaccines available to larger populations. They’re going to likely vote against giving &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/19/cdc-vaccines-acip-changes-hepatitis-b-schedule/"&gt;hepatitis B vaccines&lt;/a&gt; to infants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So if you look back at the data, 250 years ago, 40% of kids never made it to adulthood. Today, it’s 4%. The majority of that decrease is due to vaccines. Vaccines have saved more lives than any other type of medical intervention, including antibiotics, including everything. Vaccines have saved an enormous number of lives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No vaccine was tested more extensively than the RNA vaccines, and no vaccine was given to more people than the mRNA vaccines, and they were found to be incredibly safe, safer than any other vaccine platform and effective.

            Cycling isn’t just good &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/01/world/suv-cars-emissions-iea-climate-intl"&gt;for the planet&lt;/a&gt;, your wallet and your fitness. Choosing this form of transportation for your errands instead of driving or taking the train may also help you prevent cognitive decline, a recent study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfredyyq000p3b6nsp2tffqb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/17/health/biking-workout-exercise-routine-benefits-wellness"&gt;Riding a bike&lt;/a&gt; is associated with a 19% lower risk of all-cause dementia and a 22% lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease, compared with taking nonactive travel modes such as a car, bus or train, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2835115" target="_blank"&gt;found the study&lt;/a&gt; that assessed nearly 480,000 participants from Great Britain and published in the journal JAMA Network Open.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfredyyq000q3b6nzz8mtv6h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Physical activity has long been  associated with lower dementia risk in multiple studies, so much so that the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/health/dementia-childhood-risk-factors-study-wellness"&gt;2024 Lancet Commission&lt;/a&gt; identified it as one of 14 factors responsible for preventing or delaying approximately 45% of dementia cases. More than &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/29/health/anxiety-increases-dementia-risk-wellness/index.html"&gt;55 million people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide have dementia, a number expected to nearly triple by 2050.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfredyyq000r3b6nvnmy10h4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Although population-based evidence on the health effects of active travel remains scarce, systematic reviews have consistently highlighted its association with improved health outcomes, including a lower risk of diabetes,” the authors of the paper wrote. Few studies until now, however, have investigated the association between travel mode, dementia risk and structural brain changes, they added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfredyyq000s3b6n4mnsn8z0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study participants were recruited between 2006 and 2010 for the UK Biobank study, which has followed the health outcomes of more than 500,000 people age 40 to 69. Participants, who were age 56.5 on average, answered questionnaires about which of four transportation modes they had used most often to get around in the past four weeks, not including journeys to or from work: nonactive, walking, mixed walking (a combination of walking and nonactive travel modes) and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;cycling and mixed cycling (a combination of cycling and other modes).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfredyyq000t3b6njhvrxvki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over a median follow-up period of 13.1 years, 8,845 participants developed dementia, and 3,956 adults developed Alzheimer’s disease. Walking and mixed walking were linked with a 6% lower risk of dementia and, interestingly, a 14% higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The research team also discovered that the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5839141/" target="_blank"&gt;strongest genetic risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for Alzheimer’s — the APOE ε4 gene — also had an influence. Participants without APOE ε4 had a 26% lower risk of dementia, while those with the genetic variant had a 12% lower risk.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfredyyq000u3b6ni0hs6btf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cycling and mixed cycling were also most associated with greater hippocampal volumes, the region of the brain responsible for memory and learning. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfredyyq000v3b6nmg3oc89b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This study is the first to show that cycling is linked not only to a lower risk of dementia but also to a larger hippocampus,” said Dr. Joe Verghese, professor and chair of neurology at Stony Brook University in New York, via email. Verghese was not involved in the study.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfredyyq000w3b6n0dzkm5po@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The strengths of the study are impressive, but there are caveats, Dr. Sanjula Singh, principal investigator at the Brain Care Labs at Massachusetts General Hospital, said via email. She was also not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfredyyq000x3b6nxbi2b74x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Travel modes were self-reported at a single time point, so we don’t know how people’s habits changed over time,” said Singh, who is also an instructor of neurology at Harvard Medical School. “Most participants were White and healthier at baseline, so the results may not generalize to all communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfredyyq000y3b6nu6ykopi7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And, perhaps most importantly, because this is an observational study, it cannot prove that cycling directly prevents dementia,” Singh added. “It merely shows a found association.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfredyyq000z3b6n6o9on0kv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Older adults who cycle regularly are likely a healthier subgroup, and cycling may also serve as a marker of favorable genetics, with risk lowest among those without genetic susceptibility to dementia, Verghese said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfredyyq00103b6n503ubwof@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Participants who chose active travel modes were more likely to be women, nonsmokers, more educated, engaged in more physical activity in general and have a lower &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/health/bmi-versus-body-fat-wellness"&gt;body mass index&lt;/a&gt; and fewer chronic diseases, the authors wrote. Cycling and mixed-cycling groups, specifically, were more often men and those who had healthier lifestyles and physical conditions than their peers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfredyyq00113b6nx9vh7xxm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The link between greater Alzheimer’s disease risk and the preference for walking could be explained by those participants potentially already having issues with balance or driving, said Dr. Glen Finney, a behavioral neurologist and director of the Memory and Cognition Program at Geisinger Health System in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfredyyq00123b6nwe3yet7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/11/health/walking-fast-benefits-study-wellness"&gt;Walking pace&lt;/a&gt; also matters, Finney, a fellow of the American Academy of Neurology, added. Leisurely walking, especially for short distances, may not be enough to get the full potential benefit compared with walking longer distances at a brisker pace. The study did not report on the frequency, pace or duration of participants’ walking or cycling habits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Regardless, decades of research have shown that exercise is good for the brain, Verghese said. “Cycling may reduce dementia risk by improving cardiovascular fitness, increasing blood flow to the brain, supporting neuroplasticity, and improving metabolism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfredyyq00143b6nvskvbl0s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cycling also requires more effort and different types of engagement from the brain, which may also contribute to any potential boost in protection against dementia, the authors wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If you’re typically sedentary and want to start cycling, discuss with your doctor whether you’re healthy enough to begin immediately or whether you need to work up to it, Verghese said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Begin with short, safe routes on dedicated bike paths before moving into traffic,” Singh said. “Always wear a helmet, use reflective gear, and add lights if biking or walking at night. Stick to well-lit routes and, if possible, travel with a partner.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Cycling even just once or a few times per week can make a difference, Singh added, and indoor stationary cycling — though not included in the study — is an option for those concerned about &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/health/cycling-to-work-benefits-injuries-wellness"&gt;safety from traffic&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            For walking, aim for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/11/health/walking-fast-benefits-study-wellness"&gt;brisk, purposeful treks&lt;/a&gt;, and build up your distance over time, Singh suggested. That could mean walking for at least 30 minutes daily, ideally at a level of intensity that makes &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/health/talk-test-exercise-intensity-cdc-wellness"&gt;talking a little difficult&lt;/a&gt;, Verghese said. Adults need &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/25/health/world-health-organization-physical-activity-guidelines-wellness/index.html"&gt;at least 150 to 300 minutes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/10/health/cardio-aerobic-exercise-routine-wellness/index.html"&gt;moderate aerobic activity&lt;/a&gt; or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise per week, according to the World Health Organization.

                                        &lt;p&gt;Drugstores are ready to deliver updated COVID-19 vaccines this fall and insurers plan to pay for them, even though the shots no longer come recommended by an important government committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-advisers-vaccines-hepatitis-b-covid19-a1fb61ef7e29d93d2828618d890cceb3"&gt;vaccine advisers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; picked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. declined to specifically recommend the shots but said people could make individual decisions on whether to get them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommendations from the advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention require sign-off by the agency’s director, but they are almost always adopted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those recommendations normally trigger several layers of insurance coverage and allow drugstores in many states to deliver the shots. But insurers and government officials have said coverage will continue, and several states have allowed for vaccine access through pharmacies, the most common place to get shots. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Many people start seeking vaccinations in the late summer or early fall to get protection against any winter surges in cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a closer look at the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Will insurers cover these shots?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many are expected to do so, but you still may want to check with yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services said Friday that the committee vote “provides for immunization coverage through all payment mechanisms.” An HHS spokesperson said that includes Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, commercial coverage sold through health insurance marketplaces and the federal Vaccines for Children program, which pays for roughly half of childhood vaccinations in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The VFC program normally automatically covers any vaccines recommended by the CDC committee.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The trade group America’s Health Insurance Plans said earlier this week that its members will continue to cover the shots at no cost to patients through 2026. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That group includes every major insurer except UnitedHealthcare. And that insurer has said it will continue covering the vaccine at no cost for its standard commercial coverage, which includes plans offered for individuals and through small businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;One caveat: Large employers that offer coverage will make their own decisions on the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They may be motivated to continue coverage: The vaccines can help ward off expensive hospital bills from people who develop a bad case of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where people can get vaccinations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About two-thirds of adults get COVID-19 shots at pharmacies, and around 30% receive them at doctors’ offices, according to CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access to the shots has grown after &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-access-limitations-645d64cee13664840fc9a39ff2d309c0"&gt;a clunky start&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to vaccine season that saw some people travel to nearby states when they couldn’t make appointments at pharmacies closer to home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugstore chains like CVS say their locations are stocked with the latest vaccines, and they now are able to deliver vaccinations in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Prescriptions are required in D.C. and a handful of states, including Florida and Georgia, CVS Health spokeswoman Amy Thibault said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walgreens also requires prescriptions in a few states, a company spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Who can get the shot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, the U.S. has recommended yearly COVID-19 shots for everyone age 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-covid-shots-fda-kennedy-pfizer-children-9ce19908ae7afb354732aa162fd28532"&gt;recently approved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the shots for all people age 65 and older, and for younger adults and children with conditions that put them at high risk for catching a bad case of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC maintains &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/risk-factors/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a long list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of conditions that would put someone at high risk, including asthma, cancer, heart or lung problems, obesity, depression and a history of smoking. It also includes those who are physically inactive, and the agency notes that this list is not conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients can consult with their doctor or care provider to decide whether they are high risk if they don’t have a condition on that list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both CVS and Walgreens representatives say their companies will ask patients under age 65 if they have any of these factors. They won’t require proof. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In simplest terms, if a patient says they’re eligible, they will get the vaccine,” said Thibault, the CVS Health spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

                            &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Four or five times a day, in a quiet suburb of Tallinn, Rasmus mixes a powder with water, carefully fills his syringe with it, and scours his body for a vein. The substance comes in various colours depending on the batch, and he often has to add ascorbic acid to the mix to make sure it combines well with the water and remains a stable solution, something he never had to do with fentanyl. But now he’s taking a new drug, and because of the various additives it’s often cut with, just a few hits could be enough to collapse a vein — making circulation to the area impossible. “In 2019 I could hit myself blindfolded,” Rasmus explains, speaking to &lt;em&gt;UnHerd&lt;/em&gt; using a pseudonym. “Now it’s like a surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent1" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now in his 30s, Rasmus is a high-functioning opioid addict. He has a steady income, dresses well, and speaks with authority. There is little about him that suggests he has been using hard drugs for more than half his life. But even as a preteen, Rasmus was never like the other kids his age. Fascinated by the physiological effects and molecular structures of various psychoactive compounds, he soon started experimenting with everything from marijuana to MDMA and amphetamines. By age 16, his exploration had driven him to severe anxiety and depression that left him feeling like a shell of his former self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To cope, he turned to opioids — first to painkillers like tramadol, but eventually to fentanyl. “Before it’s like you’re naked, you’re in the middle of snow, you’re freezing,” Rasmus tells me in a commercial parking lot a stone’s throw from the deep blue waters of the Baltic Sea, recounting his first experience with the drug when he was around 19. “Then some mysterious stranger appears from the woods and invites you with him, and in about 50 meters a bright wooden cottage appears, you go inside, and he offers you a warm cup of tea. I felt like a human again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But those days are now little more than a distant memory. Fentanyl and its analogues have been largely absent from the Estonian market for years, after the country’s police cracked down on the Russia-connected organised criminal networks distributing them in 2017. Since then, the drug has been replaced by something even more sinister. In 2019, traces of a new class of synthetic opioids started showing up in Estonia’s drug supply. These can be tens of times more potent than fentanyl — and much more deadly. But it wasn’t until 2022 that these new designer drugs, called nitazenes, began to truly wreak havoc on Estonian society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Fentanyl is bad but nowhere near ’zenes in how addictive it is and how hard it grabs your opioid receptors,” Rasmus tells me, his eyes concealed behind dark glasses despite the shade. “It’s basically the crack of opioids.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Nitazenes have wreaked havoc elsewhere. Deaths have been reported across the US, the EU, and the UK. In Britain alone, the drugs have been linked to the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/there-has-never-been-a-more-dangerous-time-to-take-drugs-the-rising-global-threat-of-nitazenes-and-synthetic-opioids-247268" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://theconversation.com/there-has-never-been-a-more-dangerous-time-to-take-drugs-the-rising-global-threat-of-nitazenes-and-synthetic-opioids-247268&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1758270960028000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0ykkvaSPmf9wSUQd_RLzwr"&gt;deaths of over 400 people&lt;/a&gt; between June 2023 and January this year, even as &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg7dzmyjrjzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;thousands more&lt;/a&gt; opioid deaths may have been been missed from official figures. Already, nitazenes are being hailed as the harbingers of the next European opioid crisis. In the midst of this gathering storm, Estonia stands out as its unexpected epicentre. Since they arrived on Europe’s doorstep, &lt;a href="https://www.talkingdrugs.org/nitazenes-in-the-baltics-are-a-warning-for-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.talkingdrugs.org/nitazenes-in-the-baltics-are-a-warning-for-europe/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1758270960028000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2MXSRKtgjDlzhWP_TkiqIl"&gt;96% of nitazene seizures have taken place in the Baltic states&lt;/a&gt;, and between 2022 and 2024, Estonia &lt;a href="https://news.err.ee/1609745001/we-are-pioneers-in-a-bad-way-nitazenes-triple-estonian-drug-overdose-deaths" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.err.ee/1609745001/we-are-pioneers-in-a-bad-way-nitazenes-triple-estonian-drug-overdose-deaths&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1758270960028000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1McTLVRikME_Jxje2-RlGr"&gt;likely had the highest nitazene use rate&lt;/a&gt; on the continent. And while the rest of Europe was only just starting to take nitazenes seriously, by 2023, the drugs had already been implicated in 56 drug deaths in Estonia, comprising &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00024-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00024-0/fulltext&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1758270960028000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0BYO9qicaGaFKMHty_KMnk"&gt;nearly half&lt;/a&gt; of all overdose deaths in the country, pushing it &lt;a href="https://www.euda.europa.eu/publications/topic-overviews/drug-induced-deaths-faq/overdose-situation_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.euda.europa.eu/publications/topic-overviews/drug-induced-deaths-faq/overdose-situation_en&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1758270960028000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3hIGpGLuDkGwxZYKhCIZ1A"&gt;into the EU’s top spot&lt;/a&gt; for drug-induced mortalities per million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Estonia’s experience offers many lessons for the rest of Europe. But the story of nitazenes and opioids more broadly in Estonia is about far more than just law enforcement crackdowns, and underscores that the epidemic is ultimately not a problem created by the mere existence of a steady drug supply, but rather one borne out of a persistent socially-driven demand for the drugs. Woven into Estonia’s decades-long struggle with opioids, and hidden behind its reputation as a technologically advanced, highly developed Baltic economy, lies a history of unequal post-Soviet economic growth, the impact of social marginalisation, and the difficulties that state authorities and harm reduction workers alike have faced in combating a crisis that often dwarfs the resources their small country has at its disposal. Most worryingly, though, Estonia illustrates how once a robust base of addicts establishes itself within a society, not even rapid economic growth can uproot it — and that even if nitazenes can be eliminated, something worse will emerge soon enough to replace them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Somehow despite the fact that we had 17 years of experience with fentanyls, we still struggled with nitazenes,” says Katri Abel-Ollo, a researcher at the Estonian National Institute for Health Development who studies nitazene use patterns and overdose deaths. “So I can imagine that countries that don’t have experience with fentanyls, it could be quite shocking to them if nitazenes appear out of the blue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 2002, Estonia became one of the first European countries to face a fentanyl crisis, after heroin smuggling routes were disrupted following the American invasion of Afghanistan. To compensate, local dealers, in cahoots with Russian gangsters, sourced fentanyls from nearby St Petersburg, exploiting connections between the Estonian criminal underground and the country’s former imperial rulers that had endured after the fall of the USSR. Soon enough, Tallinn became the “&lt;a href="https://www.policechiefmagazine.org/defeating-the-fentanyl-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.policechiefmagazine.org/defeating-the-fentanyl-crisis/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1758270960028000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0n4Iv58Ni6wtGEsMs_fJyV"&gt;fentanyl capital&lt;/a&gt;” of Europe, leading to a 15-year battle that finally ended when Estonian police put the main players driving the drug trade behind bars, effectively shutting off the country’s fentanyl spigot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“For five years we had a very good spell for a while,” Rait Pikaro, the head of the crime bureau of the Estonian Police North Prefecture tells me. “We were a bit naïve thinking that for five years… the market was, so to say, dead, but in that sense we were mistaken.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Though fentanyl itself became much harder to find, Rasmus explains, fentanyl analogues continued to float around in the Estonian drug world, while harm reduction specialists I speak to suggest that users and dealers also turned to home-brewed opioid varieties to get by. When nitazenes emerged to fill the void, they arrived not from Russia, &lt;a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2025/01/20/chinese-link-to-nitazenes-targeting-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2025/01/20/chinese-link-to-nitazenes-targeting-europe/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1758270960028000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1r2pIiINuq9MDfBxCNiHTL"&gt;but from China&lt;/a&gt;, entering Estonia through Latvia. And in a sign of the changing drug landscape, this time there was no centralised dealer network, forcing police to play a game of cat-and-mouse with users and dealers across a fragmented market, both in Tallinn and across the eastern Estonian hinterland where opioids are most prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A far cry from fentanyl they may be, but nitazenes are ruthlessly effective, providing a powerful remedy for the withdrawal symptoms that are many addicts’ worst fear. “Potency does not equate to euphoria,” Rasmus tells me, recounting how nitazenes don’t even give him 1% of the same high he once got from fentanyl, despite how strong they can be. “Metonitazene [one of the earlier nitazenes to hit the Estonian market] for example was really good and pleasurable,” he says, “but some are just like you’re shooting up water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="su-pullquote su-pullquote-align-left"&gt;“Nitazenes are ruthlessly effective”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;According to Abel-Ollo, nitazenes have a sharper come-up, but often a shorter duration — something that can be frustrating for users like Rasmus. “You inject it, it lasts maybe a minute, some last a few seconds, some last an hour, at best,” he says, describing some of the more recent nitazenes on the market. That was clear enough just looking at him: he was visibly more anxious during the latter part of our conversation as he felt his withdrawal symptoms set in, glancing around, breathing more shallowly, and becoming less focused in his answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To make matters worse for addicts, nitazenes are often so potent that they don’t respond like other opioids to naloxone, a medication that counteracts an opioid overdose, requiring several doses to work — something that contributes greatly to nitazenes’ lethality. For these and other reasons, Artur Kamnerov, a former investigator who heads the drug and organised crime bureau of the North Prefecture police department, predicts that if nitazenes become as prevalent elsewhere as they have in Estonia, countries can expect horrifyingly similar consequences. “If nitazene starts taking over the market,” he says with a resigned look in his eye and a heaviness in his voice, “there’s no stopping the overdose death rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To explain what he means, on an unseasonably dreary and rainy summer morning, Kamnerov takes out his phone and opens up a Russian-language group on Telegram. Boasting 4,000 members, users can order Xanax, tramadol, and other painkillers. Another group has user-friendly menus where people could buy MDMA or amphetamines using cryptocurrencies. “This is the reason why no one really needs to go to the dark web anymore,” Kamnerov says. “It’s a hassle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Such ease of access is hardly limited to Estonia, of course. Narcotics, including nitazene class opioids, are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/there-has-never-been-a-more-dangerous-time-to-take-drugs-the-rising-global-threat-of-nitazenes-and-synthetic-opioids-247268" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://theconversation.com/there-has-never-been-a-more-dangerous-time-to-take-drugs-the-rising-global-threat-of-nitazenes-and-synthetic-opioids-247268&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1758270960028000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0ykkvaSPmf9wSUQd_RLzwr"&gt;sold this way&lt;/a&gt; to users and dealers alike in the UK and beyond. But what this means is that, at least in Estonia, easily accessible nitazenes shipped directly from overseas have bifurcated the opioid user base in the country, with two distinct cultures emerging. The older, more conservative community continues to rely on the more traditional street-based distribution networks, where a more hardcore culture of injection composed mainly of Russian-speakers reigns supreme. For their part, younger users source their drugs from online vendors and are predisposed to the less intimidating, more accessible pill forms of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_802006" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-802006" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-802006 size-full" src="https://unherd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/C06A4233_fe516e.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-802006" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Lasnamäe, one of the main Russian-speaking areas of Tallinn, and an opioid hotspot. Credit: Michal Kranz.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For the moment, it is the former, Russian-speaking group that still dominates Estonia’s opioid landscape, and which has long formed the backbone of the country’s sky-high demand for these drugs. This community has its roots in the country’s decades-long occupation by the USSR, when Russian immigrants to the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic moved to Tallinn, Narva, and towns in Estonia’s northeast. These new settlers initially came to work in reconstruction after the Second World War, but additional waves later arrived when new housing projects like the Lasnamäe district were erected by Soviet authorities in Tallinn in the Seventies and Eighties. Russians were often given preferential treatment in housing allocation, crowding Estonians out of these much-coveted new apartments: once seen as beacons of Estonia’s bright socialist future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Today, Russian speakers make up about 21% of Estonia’s population, but in stark contrast to their place at the top of the social hierarchy during the Soviet years, they emerged from the USSR’s collapse as an &lt;a href="https://www.ecmi.de/publications/ecmi-research-papers/91-estonian-ethnic-minorities-the-right-to-health-and-the-dangers-of-social-exclusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ecmi.de/publications/ecmi-research-papers/91-estonian-ethnic-minorities-the-right-to-health-and-the-dangers-of-social-exclusion&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1758270960028000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1Wf40SPo-xN7Qp2zDTPPtP"&gt;economically disadvantaged underclass&lt;/a&gt;. Great strides have been made to integrate Russian speakers into mainstream Estonian society, and Russian speakers now have access to the same social benefits as ethnic Estonians — but the baggage of years of socioeconomic hardship weighs the community down, and in many respects, their marginalisation persists. Russian speakers continue to make up 60% of prison inmates in the country, as well as nearly two thirds of homeless people in Tallinn. And with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has pummelled Russian speakers in Estonia with political disinformation: resonating with many, but further widening the gap with the Estonian majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That’s clear enough in Lasnamäe today. A world away from that long-dead communist ideal — let alone the charming and cosmopolitan centre of Tallinn — these suburbs are filled with monotone housing blocks, stretching out toward the horizon. The wide, sparse, avenues that separate them from each other give the area a liminal feel, a place that is neither in the past nor fully in the present. Their walls are adorned with Cyrillic graffiti: while many parts of Estonia have bilingual Estonian and Russian signs, here Russian predominates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Fundamentally, Lasnamäe’s plight can be understood as a function of the end of communism. The collapse of the Soviet system brought with it major economic shocks, leading to a sharp decrease in Estonia’s GDP that affected everyone. In 1994, the country’s life expectancy dipped below that of Ukraine and Moldova.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;By the following year, however, the economy started growing again, albeit unevenly, leaving many Russian speakers, most of whom voted against Estonia’s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, stuck in the post-collapse era, reeling from their loss of status — not forever, but long enough for patterns of social stratification and self-sabotaging nihilism to burrow deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_802014" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-802014" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-802014 size-full" src="https://unherd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/C06A4308_9c2e40.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-802014" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Nikolai, a harm reduction worker and former addict. Credit: Michal Kranz.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“That time, in the Nineties, was a time of gangsterism, very anxious times,” says Nikolai, a former addict and current harm reduction worker at MTÜ Convictus, an NGO working with drug users. Arms covered in tattoos and with a tired look in his eyes, he asks me not to use his last name: he has a long  history with drugs and has spent time in prison. “When these drugs appeared, it was a coping strategy,” Nikolai explains. “It was better than drinking alcohol, and many Russian-speaking people followed this and started to use drugs. It was fashionable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Back in the fentanyl days, places like Lasnamäe, and Estonia’s Russian-speaking society in general, held the keys to the country’s opioid market. Rasmus, who is ethnically Estonian, learned Russian explicitly to purchase opioids from local dealers. “In the poorer regions of Tallinn, like Lasnamäe, Kopli, and so on, you could say that in every [housing project] there was a dealer,” he explains, adding that fentanyl was easy to get, but only if you spoke Russian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Soon enough, even though he once told himself he would never shoot up, Rasmus was injected by a dealer not long after he got hooked on the drug. His first such experience was overwhelming, and he overdosed as soon as the fentanyl entered his body — but in doing so, he finalised his initiation into the hardcore, Russian-led Estonian drug culture that has driven the country’s opioid epidemic for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Indeed, at MTÜ Convictus’s base in downtown Tallinn, while most of the clientele are still Russian speakers, more and more ethnic Estonians are showing up as well, pointing to the expanding reach of the crisis’s long tentacles. Regardless of linguistic or ethnic background, Convictus provides users with a place to exchange used needles for clean ones, get food, obtain naloxone, meet with social workers, or even just drink some warm tea. Yulia Rõbalko, another harm reduction worker at the centre, exchanges biscuits for used needles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Harm reduction, she says, has two sides: one for the person, and one for the rest of society. “It works like a cycle,” Yulia Rõbalko. “You help him, he doesn’t spread disease with used needles, and so on. Normal people don’t see that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This blindness is part of the reason why harm reduction NGOs like MTÜ Convictus, which receive public funds from the Estonian state, are increasingly at risk of budget cuts, as peer-led services are being outsourced to organisations that don’t have as strong a connection to the community. If you ask Mart Kalvet, an activist with LUNEST, a drug policy group, building robust, grassroots support networks for drug users is only the first step in creating a long-term solution to the cycle of alienation, addiction, and suffering that has perpetuated the opioid crisis in Estonia for over a quarter century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To secure real change within a context where a user base has already become entrenched, the state must implement a regulated, safe supply of drugs all while giving users access to the resources they need to live their lives as healthily as possible. That means not only providing sustainably funded rehab services, but also getting to the root of the problem and investing in places like Lasnamäe as real, evolving parts of country, rather than mere relics of its Soviet past. It also means treating the opioid epidemic like the public health problem it surely is, rather than an exclusively criminal one. “The harder you come down on the people who use drugs and sell drugs, the more problematic drugs appear on the street,” Kalvet says. “It’s an iron law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Already, Kalvet’s prophecy appears to be coming true. According to Abel-Ollo, there have been no new drug death cases in the country since May, indicating to her that there may be fewer nitazenes on the market. But if you ask Rasmus, who keeps a close eye on reports about drug arrests and court cases, even newer synthetic opioids, called brorphines, are already coming from China to replace them. Estonia’s game of whack-a-mole with opioids, it seems, will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This is where the somewhat dark-natured Scandinavian culture collides with the dark-natured, but in another way, Eastern Europe and Slavic culture,” Kalvet suggests, musing about the reasons for Estonia’s long dance with opioids. “We are affected by both, and not in a good way. It may be a cultural yearning for some warmth that our history has not provided us with.” From roaming Swedish armies in the 17th century, to Nazi and Soviet occupation in the 20th century, it’s easy to see what he means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Yet whatever impact Estonia’s cultural proclivities may have on its drug appetite, the implications of its battle with nitazenes for larger and even more socially divided countries across the West are enormous. As markets in the UK, the US, Europe, and beyond continue to experiment with nitazenes as a more lucrative replacement for fentanyl and heroin, all signs suggest that long-time users will embrace these new drugs, creating a festering social wound that will persist so long as it has lives left to destroy. More ominously still, as Estonia’s case vividly illustrates, alienated segments of society — of which the West has plenty — can act as a fertile crucible for an opioid epidemic to not only take hold, but also spread. And in a world where thoughtful, nuanced drug policy reform is hardly on any government’s radar, the outlook is truly bleak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of living at the mercy of his addiction, Rasmus tried to get help. On two occasions, he checked into the only long-term detox clinic in Tallinn that uses substitute therapy. But now, government funding cuts have quadrupled the cost of treatment there, leaving users like him with nowhere to turn. When I asked him how he sees his future in a follow-up conversation on Signal, his response was stark: “Most likely dead.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, researchers reported evidence of a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2025-09-evidence-cosmic-impact-classic-clovis.html"&gt;cosmic impact&lt;/a&gt; at classic Clovis archaeological sites. Biologists in Texas discovered a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2025-09-grue-jay-rare-hybrid-bird.html"&gt;rare hybrid bird&lt;/a&gt;, the offspring of a blue jay and a green jay. And a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-aspirin-halves-recurrence-patients-colorectal.html" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; suggests that low-dose aspirin halves the risk of recurrence after surgery for colon and rectal tumors with a particular genetic alteration.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;All that, plus a fast new method to verify quantum computer results; the daily alcoholic consumption of chimpanzees (it's higher than you might think); and the mechanism behind exercise-induced weight loss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Multidimensional checksum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional analog computers are based on binary bits that represent either "1" or "0." Quantum computers use the superstate of particles to achieve multidimensional bits that exist simultaneously in multiple states. There are a range of problems that would take conventional computers millions of years to solve that could theoretically be calculated in seconds or minutes by a quantum computer. But once you've got that output, how do you determine whether it's correct? Using conventional computing to verify the results of a quantum calculation could take millions or billions of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Swinburne University of Technology have developed &lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2025-09-quantum-unknowable-theyre.html"&gt;new methods&lt;/a&gt; to validate the output of a specific type of quantum computer called a gaussian boson sampler, which uses photons to compute probabilities. Using their methods with a conventional laptop computer, the researchers were able to validate the results of an experiment that would take 9,000 years of calculation on contemporary supercomputers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researcher Alexander Dellios says, "A vital component of [&lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/quantum+computing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;quantum computing&lt;/a&gt;] is scalable methods of validating quantum computers, which increase our understanding of what errors are affecting these systems and how to correct for them, ensuring they retain their 'quantumness.'"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Making every hour happy hour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fruit drops from a tree, hits the ground and over time, its sugars ferment into alcohol. What are you going to do? &lt;i&gt;Not&lt;/i&gt; eat it? Chimpanzees do indeed eat fermented fruits, and over the course of an average day, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2025-09-wild-chimpanzees-ingest-equivalent-alcoholic.html"&gt;likely consume a minimum of 14 grams of pure alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new study by researchers at the University of California-Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They looked at 21 types of fruit at two chimpanzee study sites in Uganda and the Ivory Coast; fermented samples had an average alcohol content of .26%/wt. The chimpanzees who live in these sites eat an average of 10 pounds of fruit per day. Accounting for the approximate proportion of each fruit species in the chimpanzee diet, the researchers calculate that they consume the equivalent of two standard alcohol drinks per day. But this may be a low estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biologist Robert Dudley says, "If the chimps are randomly sampling &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/ripe+fruit/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;ripe fruit&lt;/a&gt; ... then that's going to be their average consumption rate, independent of any preference for ethanol. But if they are preferring riper and/or more sugar-rich fruits, then this is a conservative lower limit for the likely rate of ethanol ingestion."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exercise validated&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine have uncovered a mechanism that causes weight loss in response to exercise. When you—or a mouse, or a racehorse—exercise, blood levels of a metabolite called Lac-Phe rise. Lac-Phe causes appetite suppression, leading to weight loss. In previous work, the researchers discovered that giving Lac-Phe to obese mice induced weight loss. In the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-weight.html" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, they identified how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That mechanism is in the brain, specifically in two types of brain cells: One is called AgRP and the other is PVH. AgRP neurons in the hypothalamus stimulate hunger. PVH neurons in another hypothalamus region suppress hunger. Under normal conditions, AgRP neurons send signals that inhibit PVH neurons, thereby inducing hunger. When AgRP neurons are deactivated, PVH neurons become more active and reduce appetite. Lac-Phe directly inhibits AgRP neurons, thereby activating PVH neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mice, this caused weight loss. The researchers report that mouse behavior remained normal throughout the experiment, suggesting that there are no unpleasant side-effects of this exercise-induced appetite suppression.&lt;/p&gt;

Adverse exposures, including low education, food insecurity, and limited healthcare, were linked to cognitive decline, mental health issues, and altered brain structure and function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These associations held true both for healthy aging and in people with dementia, suggesting that adversity becomes biologically embedded in brain networks over time. The findings highlight the urgent need for prevention strategies that begin in childhood, targeting social inequality to reduce dementia risk later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cumulative Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Lifelong social adversity predicts poorer cognition, brain changes, and mental health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; In people with dementia, complex adverse exposomes worsen symptoms and brain connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Prevention:&lt;/strong&gt; Interventions in childhood and midlife can build brain resilience and lower dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;TCD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifetime significant experiences,  in particular the social ones, are the fabric of our identity. But what about their impact in our health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardships of childhood, access to education quality and social networks, exposure to violence, and many other social domains may slowly accumulate over time and decades later may shape how the brain growth, connects, and copes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new groundbreaking work published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;,researchers found that an adverse social exposome, defined as the cumulative exposure to factors such as low education, adverse childhood experiences, food insecurity, financial stress and assets, low access to healthcare, and traumatic events, is linked to poorer cognition and mental health, reduced functional ability, and alterations in brain structure and function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects have long-lasting impact not only in healthy aging but also in people living with dementia. This work suggests that healthy ageing dementia prevention should begin in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by an international team of researchers from the Global Brain Health Institute (GBHI) at Trinity College Dublin,  the Multipartner Consortium to expand dementia research in Latin America (ReDLat), and the Latin American Brain Health Institute (BrainLat).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The social exposome and brain health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers first created and validated an assessment of social exposome assessing 319 dimensions for education, food insecurity, financial status, assets, healthcare access, childhood labor, subjective and objective socioeconomic status, childhood experiences, traumatic events, and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These scores were evaluated 2211 individuals (controls, Alzheimer’s disease, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration) from six Latin American countries. This region was chosen given the larger influence of social exposome. Structural inequality, educational disparities, and social determinants of health are impacting Latin Americans’ health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In brief, the more adverse the social exposome, the larger the cognitive, functional, mental and brain impairments. Diverse social and environmental factors at different stages of life were associated with multiple dimensions of brain health. Adverse exposomes associated with poorer cognition in healthy ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In dementia, more complex exposomes (food insecurity, financial status, socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare) correlated with lower cognitive and functional performance, higher mental health symptoms, and brain structural and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the accumulation of these exposures across the lifespan, rather than the impact of individual components assessed in isolation, showed the strongest associations. The variations in participants’ country of origin, demographic and dementia-related factors, image acquisition methods, or signal quality did not account for the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, findings highlight how compounded social adversity becomes biologically embedded in brain structure and function. The tailored modeling of social exposome capture precise brain health outcomes of aging and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why prevention must begin early: implications for research and policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia prevention should not only focus on a midlife action such as controlling hypertension or diabetes. It should begin in childhood, when the foundations of brain development are laid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing food insecurity, improving education quality, and ensuring reliable access to healthcare and supportive environments in early and midlife can build brain health capital that pays off decades later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;56% of dementia cases in multiple regions like Latin America could be attributable to modifiable risk factors such as obesity, physical inactivity, and depression, compared with 46% globally. These figures are closely tied to dimensions of the social exposome and illustrate how accumulated adversity translates into higher dementia vulnerability in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joaquín Migeot, neuroscientist, Atlantic Fellow at the Global Brain Health Institute (GBHI) at Trinity, first author, said:, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The interaction between modifiable risk factors and the social exposome offers a path toward developing precision dementia prevention agendas tailored to each individual’s social exposome and risk profile.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Agustin Ibanez, Professor in Brain Health at the Global Brain Health Institute at Trinity, and School of Medicine, Trinity, and Director of the Latin American Brain health Institute (BrainLat), Universidad Adolfo ibanez, lead and corresponding author, this study evidenced&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“a systematic association of the multidimensional social lifespan experiences on brain health outcomes. These results call for the development of tailored models incorporating the impact of lifespan social environments in the biological embedding of aging and dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving beyond single factor approaches such as years of education or income, this study integrates multidimensional lifespan experiences into a social exposome index that includes education quantity and quality, food insecurity, financial stress and assets, subjective and objective socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, childhood labor and experiences, traumatic events, and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing more than 2,200 individuals across six Latin American countries, including cognitively healthy adults and people living with Alzheimer’s disease or frontotemporal dementia, a higher exposome adversity tracks with lower cognitive and functional ability, poorer mental health, alongside structural and functional alterations in dementia sensitive networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this social neuroscience and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dc9f938f94999de59ca8bfb8f2b5b9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ciara O’Shea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tcd.ie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TCD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ciara O’Shea – TCD&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63277-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Social exposome and brain health outcomes of dementia across Latin America&lt;/a&gt;” by Joaquín Migeot et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social exposome and brain health outcomes of dementia across Latin America&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multidimensional social exposome (MSE)—the combined lifespan measures of education, food insecurity, financial status, access to healthcare, childhood experiences, and more—may shape dementia risk and brain health over the lifespan, particularly in underserved regions like Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the MSE effects on brain health and dementia are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated 2211 individuals (controls, Alzheimer’s disease, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration) from a non-representative sample across six Latin American countries. Adverse exposomes associate with poorer cognition in healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In dementia, more complex exposomes correlate with lower cognitive and functional performance, higher neuropsychiatric symptoms, and brain structural and connectivity alterations in frontal-temporal-limbic and cerebellar regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food insecurity, financial resources, subjective socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare emerge as critical predictors. Cumulative exposome measures surpass isolated factors in predicting clinical-cognitive profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple sensitivity analyses confirm our results. Findings highlight the need for personalized approaches integrating MSE across the lifespan, emphasizing prevention and interventions targeting social disparities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 12:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9wNTNqVjZDSEUyVnYycVRJVldfZG5JTFZibngza2dIUG42Wm5BQnNlY1FIVm5Kdk43TmVrRmF2NFdGYzNzbWo2cTZVQWl4MC1tekUyem5FbE5zbXhPMVpkOXhZbE9ubWNFZG9DYnBrbjBiNWxxQkZ5ZEJBM0pfaWc</guid></item><item><title>减肥教练为40岁以上的女性提供5种早餐选择，以减少激素腹部脂肪|健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/weight-loss-coach-shares-5-breakfast-options-for-women-above-40-to-lose-hormonal-belly-fat-101758364655155.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/weight-loss-coach-shares-5-breakfast-options-for-women-above-40-to-lose-hormonal-belly-fat-101758364655155.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/aiims-gastroenterologist-shares-10-fibre-packed-breakfasts-for-better-digestion-which-of-these-are-you-eating-today-101758075636996.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Breakfast"&gt;Breakfast&lt;/a&gt; is deemed the most important meal of the day, as it sets the tone for the rest of the day, especially if you are on your weight loss journey.

Greek yoghurt berry bowl&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weight loss coach recommended this because of the combination of high-protein and high-fibre, which in turn helps with satiety and regulates hormones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are the required ingredients he mentioned for this meal, along with the macros, for those who are tracking calories:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; ¾ cup plain Greek yoghurt, ½ cup mixed berries, 1 tbsp chia seeds, drizzle of honey.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macros:&lt;/strong&gt; ~250 cals, 22g protein, 28g carbs, 6g fibre, 4g fat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Veggie omelette with avocado toast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meal is rich in protein, and it supports lean muscle building, while the fibre from the avocado stabilises blood sugar, as Akkani pointed out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are the ingredients and macros:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; 2 eggs, spinach, onions, peppers, 1 slice whole-grain toast, ¼ avocado&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macros:&lt;/strong&gt; ~320 cals, 24g protein, 22g carbs | 7g fibre, 16g fat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Oats with flax and blueberries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oat is a very common breakfast staple, and Akkani suggested this because the soluble fibre helps to reduce belly fat by supporting digestion and controlling insulin spikes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ingredients and macros:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; ½ cup oats, 1 Tbsp flaxseed, ½ cup blueberries, cinnamon, splash of almond milk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macros: &lt;/strong&gt;~280 cals, 10g protein, 42g carbs, 9g fibre, 7g fat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Salmon and spinach breakfast wrap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who are looking to add omega-3s to their diet, this is a good one. Akkani revealed that this meal option's omega-3 content helps to fight inflammation - which is often the reason why belly fat becomes hard to lose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Whole-grain tortilla, 2 oz smoked salmon, handful spinach, 1 Tbsp hummus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macros:&lt;/strong&gt; ~300 cals, 22g protein, 28g carbs, 6g fibre, 10g fat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Protein smoothie&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein smoothie is the go-to for busy mornings. Akkani also confirmed that it’s a quick option that provides both protein and greens, helping to keep you full and support gut health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients: &lt;/strong&gt;1 scoop whey or plant protein, 1 cup unsweetened almond milk, ½ banana, a handful of kale, 1 Tbsp almond butter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macros:&lt;/strong&gt; ~350 cals, 28g protein, 30g carbs, 8g fibre, 12g fat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, starting your day with a protein-rich breakfast helps you stay fuller for longer as you feel less hungry, significantly curbing hunger pangs that may cause overeating and derail your weight loss goals. So beginning your day with a protein-rich breakfast is non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

    &lt;p&gt;For retired grandfather Ed Langevin, life was good. He spent plenty of time with his grandkids. He went to church regularly. And he loved the simple things, like a bowl of pasta or a sub from his favorite deli. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in February 2024, everything changed. Every meal left Langevin with heartburn. He could barely eat, and even a little bit of food made him feel full. While he used to regularly eat a whole sub, now a quarter of the sandwich left him feeling full and kept him from eating for days. He was often nauseous, and he became afraid of eating because of the pain food caused him. He lost 20 pounds in three months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't think I was going to make it, to be honest," Langevin told CBS News. "I just wasn't feeling good at all. I'd be laying out in the sunroom on the couch most of the day." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langevin struggled to learn what was wrong with him. His general doctor "did all sorts of tests," Langevin said, including checking his liver and pancreas. Finally, in May 2024, a stomach scan revealed that he had an &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/danielle-perea-intestinal-transplant-mesenteric-ischemia/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;unusual condition called mesenteric ischemia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. His doctor said he'd only seen it once before. Langevin had never heard of it and researching the condition filled him with fear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I made the bad decision of going on Google and checking this out, and oh my gosh, I thought I had only a few years left by the way those articles were," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specialist that his primary care physician sent him to see set him straight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He said, 'Don't ever look at that stuff, just don't,'" Langevin said. "He said, 'We're going to get you through it.'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is mesenteric ischemia? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mesenteric ischemia occurs when narrowed or blocked arteries restrict blood flow to the small intestine, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mesenteric-ischemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20374989" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Mayo Clinic's website&lt;/a&gt;. There are two forms of mesenteric ischemia: Acute and chronic. Acute mesenteric ischemia occurs suddenly and is often caused by a blood clot, according to the Mayo Clinic. Chronic mesenteric ischemia builds up over time and usually occurs when fatty deposits build up in the arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chronic case of the condition can become acute if left untreated, the Mayo Clinic said. The condition can cause pain, malnutrition and potentially fatal complications, including intestinal damage and organ failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langevin had the latter form of the disease, said Dr. Gabriel Wallace, the director of vascular surgery at the Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute at Northwestern Medicine Palos Hospital. Langevin's condition was "pretty extreme," Wallace said. Patients like Langevin tend to be miserable by the time they are diagnosed, Wallace said.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They can't eat, they lose weight, they start becoming malnourished, and there's a real psychiatric or psychologic detriment," Wallace said. "The psychological toll of not being able to eat, the disruption of your normal life, the pain, the fear of eating, it totally wrecks people." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treating mesenteric ischemia &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While mesenteric ischemia is dangerous and unpleasant, it's not difficult to treat, Wallace said. He performed a minimally invasive procedure on Langevin in June 2024, placing a stent in the superior mesenteric artery. The stent holds the artery open and allows blood to flow normally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surgery took less than an hour, Wallace said. Langevin was sent home the same day. He was also placed on antiplatelet medication, Wallace said. Langevin said that when he returned for his two-week check-up, he was able to eat an entire sub sandwich without any discomfort first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For about a year, everything went well. In March 2025, Langevin began feeling bloating and discomfort after eating again. He returned to Wallace. A scan found that some scarring from the first surgery was compressing the stent. Wallace said it was not an uncommon complication and he performed a second procedure that extended the stent. Langevin will continue to receive regular follow-up care to ensure that the condition is correctly managed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting back to normal  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, about six months out from his follow-up surgery, Langevin is back to his old self. Steaks, pasta and sandwiches are back on the menu. He has gained back most of the weight he lost and is back to spending plenty of time with his grandkids. He and his wife are planning to travel to Rome in November as part of a pilgrimage with his local church.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm doing really good. I'm feeling normal," Langevin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Langevin told CBS News that he hopes his story reminds others of the importance of advocating for themselves in a healthcare setting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Just don't give up," Langevin said. If you find a doctor that's given up on you, find another one, but just don't give up." &lt;/p&gt;

Traditional treatments like chemotherapy, radiation, and even newer forms of immunotherapy seem to score an initial victory only to see the cancer reappear some months later. The culprit is often the same: the immune system's most powerful cancer-killing fighters, T cells, burn out or disappear too soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a team of &lt;a href="https://www.ucla.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt; researchers has tried a new way to keep those front-line warriors much longer. In the first-ever clinical trial, scientists have combined two powerful approaches—engineered T cells and gene-edited blood-forming stem cells—to create what is basically an internal immune factory. The goal is simple but lofty: teach the body to create its own fresh new supply of cancer-hunting T cells for months, if not years, after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phase-one trial was run by Dr. Theodore Scott Nowicki, along with Dr. Antoni Ribas, Dr. Owen Witte, Dr. Donald Kohn, Dr. Lili Yang, and Nobel Prize winner Dr. David Baltimore. The study has taken over ten years to develop in the lab, and while it's beginning, the technique potentially could one day change the way we treat some of the most challenging cancers to cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-994w21" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Stem cells.

Engineered T cells that are programmed to hunt down and destroy cancer cells can shrink tumors dramatically. But all too frequently the gains prove temporary. The T cells become exhausted or get eliminated, and the cancer adapts and spreads again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nowicki explained the challenge: “We’re trying to address a problem that limits many current cancer immunotherapies for solid tumors. They often work at first, but the benefit doesn’t last because the infused &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lab-grown-t-cells-engineered-to-live-longer-and-fight-cancer-more-effectively/"&gt;T cells&lt;/a&gt; eventually die or become exhausted. The idea was to create a system where the patient’s body keeps generating cancer-fighting immune cells over time. It’s kind of like installing a permanent immune upgrade.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's where the new technology comes in—pairing T cells with gene-modified hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs. They're the same bone marrow stem cells that produce all of a body's immune cells and blood. By engineering them to make a tumor-specific receptor, researchers hoped to create a self-renewing pool of cancer-censoring T cells. These would last long after the initial delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-4y4phf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="targeting_ny_eso_1_a_bullseye_on_tumor_cells"&gt;Targeting NY-ESO-1: A Bullseye on Tumor Cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this research, the researchers aimed at a cancer marker called NY-ESO-1. A "cancer-testis antigen," NY-ESO-1 is found in various cancers like sarcoma and melanoma but not in normal adult tissues. So that makes it a safer target because there will be lesser likelihood of attacking healthy cells. Dr. Nowicki explained, "NY-ESO-1 is found in a range of cancers, like sarcoma and melanoma, but it's rarely found in healthy adult tissues, so it's a relatively safe target."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-994w21" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Overview of manufacturing protocol, and clinical trial procedures.

Some 80% of synovial sarcomas are NY-ESO-1 positive, which gives the researchers a good molecular target on which to base their therapeutic T cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-4y4phf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_the_therapy_works"&gt;How the Therapy Works&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process starts with the collection of a patient's own blood-making stem cells. In the lab, scientists insert the gene map for an NY-ESO-1-reactive T cell receptor into the stem cells using gene therapy techniques. The receptor is a molecular compass guiding the resulting T cells straight to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/cambridge-scientists-reprogram-brain-cancer-cells-to-stop-them-from-spreading/"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; bearing NY-ESO-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the engineered stem cells are ready, patients undergo high-dose chemotherapy in order to clear their bone marrow. The modified stem cells are then infused back into the bloodstream and migrate to the bone marrow, where they become integrated. Later on, these stem cells begin to produce T cells that have been engineered with the tumor-homing receptor—providing a constant internal supply of cancer-destroying cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;UCLA's Dr. Ribas, director of the tumor immunology program, described how it works: "This is accomplished by putting the cancer-specific receptors into the stem cells through the means of gene therapy, and then subjecting a bone marrow transplant to insert the gene modified stem cells, which then produce the genetically-redirected anti-cancer combat immune cells inside the patient's body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-994w21" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Retroviral and lentiviral-transduced cell engraftment kinetics in patient NYSCT-01.

But the early results were encouraging. One patient showed measurable tumor shrinkage and had continuing detectable levels of engineered T cells for months. Imaging also confirmed that the stem cells had engrafted well and were producing the target &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/car-t-cells-can-be-reprogrammed-to-slow-down-and-reverse-aging-study-finds/"&gt;T cells&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We really taught the body how to produce its own armory of cancer-fighting T cells," said Dr. Nowicki. "That's never been done in humans before.".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The designed T cells provided no sign of anergy (a form of immune paralysis) or exhaustion, two factors that have otherwise restricted the potential of earlier T cell therapies. This suggests that the approach could provide more durable cancer control than standard T cell infusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-4y4phf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_challenge_ahead"&gt;The Challenge Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with promise, the therapy is now experimental and challenging. The procedure is complex, involving stem cell procurement, gene manipulation, and bone marrow conditioning. It requires skilled teams, advanced laboratory facilities, and strong patient health before treatment is started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nowicki compared it to bone marrow transplants in their early days. "Right now, it's definitely complex, but so were &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-bone-marrow-treatment-can-cure-sickle-cell-disease/"&gt;bone marrow&lt;/a&gt; transplants in their infancy," he said. Since this was a phase I trial, there weren't large numbers of patients, and long-term results are not known. The trials will have to be larger in size to confirm if this approach can reliably extend survival or stop cancer from coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-1v3ia8v" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uses go well beyond cancer. The same principle—engineered stem cells to construct an ongoing immune barrier—could be used for chronic infections like HIV or even autoimmune diseases, where reeducating the immune system could balance it out.

Sehgal’s breakfast is similar: a veggie omelet made with spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms and, sometimes, a little cheese. “I usually pair it with a side of avocado or some smoked salmon if I’m feeling fancy,” he added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both of the experts say an egg/veggie breakfast is loaded with nutrients scientifically connected to longevity. “This kind of breakfast is great because it’s loaded with protein, which is great for your musculoskeletal health. The veggies add a bunch of vitamins and antioxidants, as well as fiber, which are great for gut health.

While vegetables are often regulated to lunch and dinner, incorporating them into your breakfast along with an unprocessed protein source is a science-backed way to increase your lifespan. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Starting your morning by adding years to your life? Not too shabby of a way to start the day. Use it to set the tone and keep the longevity-supporting habits coming.

By day, I was a successful businessman, but at night I felt like a rag — powerless in bed, hopeless, ashamed. The surgery restored my confidence, my masculinity, and my joy for life. I exercise again, my mood has improved, I travel, work, and live — and I have a fulfilling sex life with my wife.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91hf6" data-offset-key="4bh1q-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4bh1q-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4bh1q-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Amir, the owner of a construction and project management firm in Haifa, now shares his story to encourage men who silently suffer from impotence to consider penile implants without shame. His path was not simple: it was paved with love, devastating loss, life-threatening illnesses, and ultimately, a fight to reclaim intimacy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="91hf6" data-offset-key="aj53u-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91hf6" data-offset-key="elbn9-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="elbn9-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="elbn9-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Amir and his childhood sweetheart, Sima, grew up together in Tiberias. “By 14, we were in love. At 20, still soldiers, we married,” he says. They built a family — two daughters and a son — and later moved to Haifa. Sima managed a radiology clinic, while Amir ran projects. “We had a fairy-tale life. We only needed each other.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91hf6" data-offset-key="ddb8j-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ddb8j-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ddb8j-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;But 12 years ago, during a trip to Madrid, Sima suddenly fell ill. Back in Israel, tests revealed pancreatic cancer. Despite conventional and experimental treatments, her condition deteriorated rapidly. Just three months later, she died in Rambam Hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="91hf6" data-offset-key="6vn7t-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.rJefa3g2jgl" id="image_ArticleImageData.rJefa3g2jgl"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.rJefa3g2jgl" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/09/08/BktT9fn9gg/BktT9fn9gg_1_38_1000_563_0_x-large.jpg" alt="ייעוץ לפני ניתוח להשתלת תותב פין" title="Pre-surgery consultation for a penile implant  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.rJefa3g2jgl" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/09/08/BktT9fn9gg/BktT9fn9gg_1_38_1000_563_0_x-large.jpg" alt="ייעוץ לפני ניתוח להשתלת תותב פין" title="Pre-surgery consultation for a penile implant  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Pre-surgery consultation for a penile implant &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91hf6" data-offset-key="fhkf8-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="fhkf8-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="fhkf8-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The couple’s daughter, Rotem, rushed to marry her fiancé before her mother’s decline. “Sima was too weak to attend. I was there for Rotem, and later returned to whisper to Sima, ‘Our daughter is married.’ She asked me for a kiss — and as I pressed my lips to her cheek, I felt her hand go limp. Her beautiful blue eyes turned gray. She was gone.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91hf6" data-offset-key="7s6tj-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7s6tj-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7s6tj-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The grief left Amir hollow. “I couldn’t bear the silence of the house. I searched for her in every room.” Four months later, determined not to drown in despair, he began a new relationship. Soon after, his kidneys failed. His new partner took charge, found a hospital abroad willing to perform a transplant, and supported him through it. “I got a second chance at life, and we married in 2015,” Amir says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="91hf6" data-offset-key="b6m9f-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.H1xRbTx3oex" id="image_ArticleImageData.H1xRbTx3oex"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.H1xRbTx3oex" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/09/08/rJMtp9M35xl/rJMtp9M35xl_1_0_1000_563_0_x-large.jpg" alt="תותבי פין שונים" title="Different penile implants  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.H1xRbTx3oex" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/09/08/rJMtp9M35xl/rJMtp9M35xl_1_0_1000_563_0_x-large.jpg" alt="תותבי פין שונים" title="Different penile implants  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Different penile implants &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91hf6" data-offset-key="ctkt0-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ctkt0-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ctkt0-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Happiness didn’t last. Not long after, Amir was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Surgeons warned that removing the prostate would likely destroy his ability to have erections. “It was a choice between life without sex, or sex without life. In other words — to live, or to enjoy.” He chose surgery, followed by 60 rounds of radiation. All the while, he hid the illness, maintaining his image as “the big boss.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91hf6" data-offset-key="8iajd-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="8iajd-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="8iajd-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Amir was not ready to give up on sexuality. “I told myself, after losing Sima, surviving a kidney transplant and cancer — I deserve to live fully. If I solve the erection problem, I’ll get myself back.” Pills and injections failed him. Then, in 2019, he underwent surgery with Dr. Ohad Shoshani at Rabin Medical Center to implant a penile prosthesis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="91hf6" data-offset-key="6bfkp-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91hf6" data-offset-key="13muk-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="13muk-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="13muk-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“Three months later, I was back to sexual activity. Six months later, I barely remembered it was an implant. I press a tiny button, get an erection, and, most importantly, I can satisfy my wife. The intimacy makes our bond stronger. With one click, I can have an erection again and again — like I was 20.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91hf6" data-offset-key="than-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="than-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="than-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Now, Amir volunteers to mentor men considering the surgery. “I remember the despair — a powerful man by day, nothing at night. Impotent. Don’t lock yourself in the closet of shame. The solution is there. If I had known about penile implants earlier, I wouldn’t have delayed prostate surgery out of fear of impotence, which risked my life.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91hf6" data-offset-key="3747p-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3747p-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3747p-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dr. Shoshani, a senior urologist at Rabin Medical Center who trained in Chicago and Melbourne, explains that two main types of penile implants are used: semi-rigid silicone rods and inflatable three-part systems. “The inflatable implant most closely mimics natural function,” he says. “A small pump in the scrotum moves fluid into cylinders inside the penis, creating an erection. After sex, the fluid returns to a reservoir in the abdomen.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="91hf6" data-offset-key="9dohc-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.HJgkETe2sgx" id="image_ArticleImageData.HJgkETe2sgx"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.HJgkETe2sgx" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/09/08/rJZ011xh5ee/rJZ011xh5ee_0_16_1600_900_0_x-large.jpg" alt='ד"ר אוהד שושני, רופא בכיר במערך האורולוגיה בבילינסון מקבוצת כללית' title="Dr. Ohad Shoshani  (Photo: Raviv Stein) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.HJgkETe2sgx" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/09/08/rJZ011xh5ee/rJZ011xh5ee_0_16_1600_900_0_x-large.jpg" alt='ד"ר אוהד שושני, רופא בכיר במערך האורולוגיה בבילינסון מקבוצת כללית' title="Dr. Ohad Shoshani  (Photo: Raviv Stein) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Dr. Ohad Shoshani &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Raviv Stein&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91hf6" data-offset-key="fdd1q-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="fdd1q-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="fdd1q-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Both implants are covered by Israel’s national health basket, with partial patient co-payment, and are also reimbursed by some private insurers. The surgery, performed in public or private hospitals, does not lengthen or enlarge the penis, nor does it affect sensation or orgasm. Its purpose is to restore reliable erections when all other treatments fail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="91hf6" data-offset-key="1tplu-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="1tplu-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1tplu-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Amir insists his story is about more than sex. “It’s about dignity, confidence, and living fully.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pistachios take the crown as the healthiest nut, thanks to their high protein, fiber, and antioxidant content that supports blood sugar balance and gut health, and reduces inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One ounce delivers nearly 6 grams of protein, making pistachios one of the most protein-rich nuts and a steady energy-booster throughout the day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small servings go a long way, and adding a handful to meals (like yogurt, stir-fry, or snacks) boosts flavor, crunch, and nutrition without breaking the bank.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you get a hankering for something quick and filling, snacks are the answer. But with a plethora of options on the market, satiating doesn’t always mean healthy. That’s why nuts are a dietitian-approved middle ground: “&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-nuts-to-eat-11686130" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nuts are a powerhouse&lt;/a&gt; food group because they’re rich in healthy fats and essential nutrients, and they’re an easy win for plant-based eaters or those just trying to get more protein throughout the day,” says certified nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.carrielupoli.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Carrie Lupoli&lt;/a&gt;. “Plus, they add a satisfying crunch to any meal.” While all nuts are good for you, we asked a registered dietitian to pick the healthiest nut—and lucky for us, it's also delicious.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While all nuts serve a healthy purpose—like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-fiber-foods-11690551" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;boosting fiber&lt;/a&gt; and protein, and stabilizing blood sugar—pistachios are Lupoli’s standout choice for the healthiest nut. “Pistachios are one of the highest-protein nuts, with nearly 6 grams per ounce, which makes them a fantastic option for keeping blood sugar stable and energy levels consistent throughout the day,” she says. “They’re also rich in antioxidants and fiber to support gut health and reduce inflammation.” One cup of pistachios packs 25 grams of protein, providing at least a quarter of the daily recommended value. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I like to use a small handful of nuts as my fat source in meals or snacks, always paired with a protein and carb to help balance my blood sugar,” Lupoli says. “One of my favorite quick, no-brainer breakfasts: &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/easy-ways-to-add-greek-yogurt-to-your-diet-11810883" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Greek yogurt, fresh berries, and chopped pistachios&lt;/a&gt; sprinkled on top. It gives you that satisfying crunch without the added sugar of granola, and it keeps your energy steady all morning.” But if you’re just not a fan of pistachios, Lupoli has an alternate suggestion as well. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I also love tossing cashews into a stir-fry or pairing nut butter and apple slices with turkey roll-ups,” she says. Or, you can replace &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/pistachio-benefits-11779364" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pistachios&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health-benefits-of-cashews-7110031" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cashews&lt;/a&gt; with your nut of choice. Because as Lupoli emphasizes, “yes, nuts can be a little pricey, but you don’t need a lot—just a small amount used intentionally goes a long way in fueling your body well.”&lt;br&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The idea of living like our ancestors has become something of a wellness craze. Take the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/paleo-diet" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Paleo diet&lt;/a&gt;, barefoot running, and cold plunges — trends that encourage you to shed the comforts of modern living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But anthropologist Michael Gurven, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, says these fads miss the deeper meaning of how our ancestors survived and thrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gurven has spent decades living and working with remote tribal populations to learn how humans evolved to thrive in challenging environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has spent time with indigenous tribes like the Moseten and Tsimane in Bolivia, who follow traditional subsistence lifestyles and have extraordinarily good health, with strikingly low rates of chronic illnesses like &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cardiologist-how-fast-your-heart-is-aging-tips-to-prevent-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying their lifestyles not only taught Gurven how our own ancestors might have developed resilience but also how we may be able to implement that knowledge today, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cue his new book, "Seven Decades," which explains why humans evolved to live so long and shares some lessons for modern life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their habits don't look like any wellness influencer's routine. Here are four tenets they live by, from social bonds to steady exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="72fd3c9b-148a-4000-8aab-9b94b63971d5" data-toc-id="72fd3c9b-148a-4000-8aab-9b94b63971d5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans are built to be social&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major lesson of living with hunter-gatherer groups is that humans evolved to work together, according to Gurven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Middle-aged and older adults are part of the reason that we're actually fairly successful as a species," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple generations of the Tsimane share the burden of daily tasks like hunting, fishing, preparing food, and caring for children.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;On a recent trip to Bolivia, Gurven said he was struck by how tribe members were socializing almost constantly, and everyone was expected to join in across multiple age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an inspiration for rethinking the story of older people in our growing population," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gurven has taken that to heart. While modern society is more segmented, with people confined to their age groups, he finds ways to connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even as much as I work, it's rare that I turn down social invitations because in the end nurturing that kind of community and friendships is really what's important," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="42d291a7-42ba-4b07-a42a-38013f0d46a7" data-toc-id="42d291a7-42ba-4b07-a42a-38013f0d46a7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We thrive on learning new things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

It's part of what makes us human. Meanwhile, our close ancestors, chimpanzees, develop the life skills to be self-sufficient much faster and also age much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ability to live well into seven decades, that's just very human," Gurven said. "You only get really productive well into adulthood, and it wouldn't really make sense to adopt that strategy if you couldn't be guaranteed to live long enough to reap the gains of all that effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="9237da1f-c705-4583-b1bf-2ce422ac8baa" data-toc-id="9237da1f-c705-4583-b1bf-2ce422ac8baa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthy eating doesn't need to be complicated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="9237da1f-c705-4583-b1bf-2ce422ac8baa"&gt;According to Gurven's research, the Tsimane have some of the healthiest hearts in the world, in part because of what they eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="9237da1f-c705-4583-b1bf-2ce422ac8baa"&gt;They don't follow a low-carb, high-fat Paleo diet. Tsimane staples include rice, corn, starchy sweet potatoes, and plantains, along with fruit, nuts, fish, and wild game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="9237da1f-c705-4583-b1bf-2ce422ac8baa"&gt;Don't rush to eat just like that.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;"I think it's just absurd to think that there's any single optimal diet," Gurven said. Instead, focus on two main lessons from the hunter-gatherer menu: eating &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-eat-a-completely-unprocessed-food-diet-benefits-drawbacks-2021-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;fewer empty calories&lt;/a&gt; and more whole foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase Michael Pollan, who also wrote about this community,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the Tsimane eat real food and not too much, since there isn't a lot extra to go around beyond what they need to fuel daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for himself, rather than mimicking a hunter-gatherer diet exactly, Gurven said he's cut back on salt, eats more moderate portions without overthinking it, and never drinks soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a7142f8e-3e42-43cc-90ab-b0889f7db567" data-toc-id="a7142f8e-3e42-43cc-90ab-b0889f7db567"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow and steady exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a myth that the hunter-gatherers of our past were super fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We tend to have in our minds vigorous hunters chasing down game and doing triathlete-type activities all the time. And that's just not true," Gurven said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, modern society is&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;more sedentary by comparison, with the average American taking about &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/walking-10000-steps-for-health-not-science-based-in-marketing-2021-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;5,000 steps per day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the Tsimane tribe get an average of 17,000 steps per day while foraging for fruit and nuts, harvesting corn and plantains, and hunting and fishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a lot more than I'm getting," Gurven said. "But the big motivation is that it's a lot of light and moderate activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He opts for walking and hiking outdoors whenever possible, and making it a social activity so it sticks as a habit and doesn't feel like a chore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anything helps in the activity domain. I think in some ways it's encouraging to a lot of Americans who are intimidated by gyms," Gurven said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Take one study, which examined the rates of latent prostate cancer (prostate cancer only discovered after death) in men of Japanese descent in their home country and on the west coast of America, compared with men with Japanese heritage who had spread out further across the west.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In Japan and San Francisco, the rates of latent prostate cancer were similar,” says Professor Derek Rosario, consultant urological surgeon at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals. “In those men who had moved further across the world, the rates were higher, even after generations. We know that this must be attributable to lifestyle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extent of lifestyle influence on prostate cancer is still being teased out, experts say, but the evidence already points to some simple measures that you can take that could help cut your risk of developing prostate cancer in your lifetime. Here is what the science says about how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Eat a Mediterranean diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet is a huge risk factor when it comes to a man’s vulnerability to certain cancers. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/bowel-cancer/?msockid=01a2fffac90968131f1ce990c8326991"&gt;Bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is 20 per cent more likely to occur in someone who eats at least 76g of red meat or processed meat (about one large pork sausage) per day, compared with those who eat just 21g (roughly one chipolata sausage) per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between diet and prostate cancer is less well-established. “Red meat could possibly increase a man’s risk of prostate cancer, but diet is very hard to observe accurately. People often don’t eat quite as healthily as they believe they do,” says Professor Nick James, from the Institute for Cancer Research. “Meat eaters have a slightly higher risk overall, but it’s hard to work out exactly why that is. Vegetarians might be more likely to exercise or eat more healthily in general, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is known, however, is that “what’s good for the heart is good for the prostate,” as Prof Rosario puts it. Some studies indicate that eating a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/mediterranean-diet-meal-plan-healthy-recipes/?msockid=01a2fffac90968131f1ce990c8326991"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; can protect against the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer, with &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13685538.2018.1450854#d1e384"&gt;other research&lt;/a&gt; showing that adherence to this diet can reduce both incidence and mortality by 10 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, “eating lots of oily fish and unsaturated fats, and eating fewer carbs and highly processed foods, may reduce your risk, though we don’t yet have definitive evidence,” Prof Rosario says. Lycopene from raw tomatoes may be especially helpful, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Telegraph</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPUXFSY0xfeWFDYnBtZEhUVUNVUk4tYlhOTlRCS0hhWW1mVF96WU9nemw1NmNtaklUbUZuQ251Q0JuMXdiM0h5UmplZXZ6bkFoS1M4ckEzcXBTNldtWHFnSTg0QnhOOVdnTFA4WjdIaWRkR0VDbE1vUFZUalFrSmVLeG9ZWWRXSmY4Ymh2WW1tcUo2Z1M5RFBkS2w0QkZNSHdTWV9keEQ3bnJHZw</guid></item><item><title>几乎没有人使用这种令人惊讶的简单治疗高血压的方法- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250919085237.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Few people with high blood pressure were using salt substitutes, even though they are a simple and effective way to lower sodium intake and manage blood pressure, according to preliminary research presented at the American Heart Association's Hypertension Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting is the premier scientific exchange focused on recent advances in basic and clinical research on high blood pressure and its relationship to cardiac and kidney disease, stroke, obesity and genetics.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure occurs when the force of blood flowing through the blood vessels is consistently too high. High blood pressure can lead to other serious events such as heart attack and stroke. Using data from 2017 to 2020, 122.4 million (46.7%) adults in the U.S. had high blood pressure and it contributed to more than 130,000 deaths. Too much sodium and too little potassium in the diet are risk factors for high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Overall, less than 6% of all U.S. adults use salt substitutes, even though they are inexpensive and can be an effective strategy to help people control blood pressure, especially people with difficult-to-treat high blood pressure," said lead study author Yinying Wei, M.C.N., R.D.N., L.D., and Ph.D. candidate in the departments of applied clinical research and hypertension section, cardiology division, at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. "Health care professionals can raise awareness about the safe use of salt substitutes by having conversations with their patients who have persistent or hard-to-manage high blood pressure."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salt substitutes are products that replace some or all of the sodium with potassium. Potassium salt tastes similar to regular salt, except when heated it can have a bitter aftertaste. Many foods contain some sodium in their natural state, however, the largest amount of sodium comes from processed and packaged foods and meals prepared at restaurants. The American Heart Association recommends consuming no more than 2,300 mg of sodium a day, with an ideal limit of less than 1,500 mg per day for most adults, especially for those with high blood pressure. For most people, cutting back by 1,000 mg a day can improve blood pressure and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to examine long-term trends in salt substitute use among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2003 to 2020, researchers analyzed the use of products that replace salt with potassium-enriched or other alternative salts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation focused on people with high blood pressure, and an additional analysis was conducted among adults eligible to use salt substitutes, including people with normal kidney function and those not taking medications or supplements that affect blood potassium levels. Some salt substitutes contain potassium, and they can raise blood potassium to dangerous levels in people with kidney disease or those taking certain medications or potassium supplements. Excessive potassium can lead to irregular heart rhythms. People with high blood pressure who are thinking about switching from regular salt to a salt substitute should first consult with a health care professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Overall, salt substitute use among all U.S. adults remained low, peaking at 5.4% in 2013-2014 before falling to 2.5% by 2017-March 2020. Data collection for 2020 stopped before March because of the pandemic.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Among adults eligible to use salt substitutes, only 2.3% to 5.1% did so.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Usage was highest in people with high blood pressure whose BP was controlled with medications (3.6%-10.5%), followed by those with high blood pressure whose BP was not controlled despite medications (3.7%-7.4%).&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Salt substitute use remained consistently less than 5.6% among people with untreated high blood pressure and for people with normal blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Adults who ate at restaurants three or more times a week appeared less likely to use salt substitutes compared to those who ate out less often, but this difference was no longer statistically significant after accounting for age, race/ethnicity, education level and insurance status.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Salt substitute use remained uncommon over the last two decades including among people with high blood pressure," Wei said. "Even among individuals with treated and poorly managed or untreated high blood pressure, most continued to use regular salt."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study highlights an important and easy missed opportunity to improve blood pressure in the U.S. -- the use of salt substitutes," said Amit Khera, M.D., M.Sc., FAHA, an American Heart Association volunteer expert. "The fact that use of salt substitutes remains so low and has not improved in two decades is eye-opening and reminds patients and health care professionals to discuss the use of these substitutes, particularly in visits focused on high blood pressure." Khera, who was not involved in this study, is a professor of medicine, clinical chief of cardiology and director of preventive cardiology at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study has several limitations. First, information about salt substitute use was self-reported, so there may have been underreporting or misclassification. In addition, all types of salt substitutes were included in the analysis, therefore, the analysis could not specifically separate potassium-enriched salt from other types of salt substitutes. Finally, the survey data did not capture how much salt substitute the participants used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Future research should explore why salt substitute-use remains low by investigating potential barriers, such as taste acceptance, cost and limited awareness among both patients and clinicians," said Wei. "These insights may help guide more targeted interventions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study details, background and design:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The analysis included 37,080 adults, ages 18 and older (37.9% were aged 18-39, 36.9% were aged 40-59 years, and 25.2% were aged 60 and older). 50.6% of participants were women, 10.7% of participants self-reported their race as non-Hispanic Black, and 89.3% self-reported they were from other racial and ethnic groups.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Participants were categorized into four subgroups based on presence or absence of high blood pressure (≥130/80 mm Hg) and whether they were using blood pressure lowering medication: 1) high blood pressure that was treated and controlled; 2) high blood pressure that was treated and not controlled; 3) untreated high blood pressure; and 4) those with normal blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Salt types were classified as ordinary salt (iodized salt, sea salt, kosher salt), salt substitute (potassium-enriched or other salt substitute) and no salt use.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;An additional analysis was conducted on a subgroup of individuals eligible to use salt substitutes -- those with healthy kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60) and not taking medications or supplements that affect blood potassium levels.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The frequency of eating at restaurants to assess its influence on salt substitute use was also evaluated.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;All analyses incorporated NHANES sampling weights and complex survey design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Highlights:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Despite their effectiveness in lowering sodium intake and managing blood pressure, salt substitutes were rarely used by people with high blood pressure, according to a review of almost 20 years of U.S. health survey data.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Researchers recommend increasing awareness of salt substitutes as a strategy to help effectively treat blood pressure, especially for individuals with difficult-to-treat or treatment-resistant high blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The study is supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The study featured in this news release is a research abstract.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Abstracts presented at American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s scientific meetings are not peer-reviewed, and the findings are considered preliminary until published as a full manuscript in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
