In serious cases, patients develop haemorrhaging from the nose, gums and internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethiopian authorities first detected the virus on Wednesday in the Jinka area after receiving alerts about a suspected hemorrhagic illness. Officials tested 17 individuals, identifying at least nine infections before confirming the initial deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daba said that work is progressing to bring the outbreak under control quickly through a coordinated national response. The government has activated emergency response centres at multiple levels and deployed rapid response teams to affected areas, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ethiopian minister added that no active symptomatic cases are currently being treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethiopia has established its own laboratory testing capacity for Marburg at the national public health institute, allowing authorities to conduct diagnostics independently rather than relying solely on external support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minister urged anyone experiencing symptoms to seek immediate medical testing at health facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International health teams from the World Health Organization and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have arrived to support containment efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry has also launched a public awareness &lt;a href="https://x.com/FMoHealth/status/1990334086637068734" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt;, distributing infographics in Amharic detailing symptoms and prevention measures, and establishing a hotline for reporting suspected cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marburg spreads through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus kills roughly half of those infected on average, though mortality rates have climbed as high as 88 percent in previous outbreaks, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to WHO data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN health agency warns that health workers are especially vulnerable to being infected by the virus “through close contact with patients when infection control precautions are not strictly practised”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ethiopian outbreak extends a troubling pattern of haemorrhagic fever emergencies across East Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Marburg outbreak in Tanzania claimed 10 lives between January and March this year, while Rwanda ended its first recorded Marburg outbreak last December, with 15 people killed by the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rwanda tested an experimental vaccine during its outbreak response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Africa CDC Director-General Jean Kaseya expressed particular concern about potential spillover into South Sudan, citing the country’s weak healthcare infrastructure as a major vulnerability in containing cross-border transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 18:07:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>肥胖药物如何平息大脑中的“食物噪音” -自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03766-2</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03766-2/d41586-025-03766-2_51719060.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03766-2/d41586-025-03766-2_51719060.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A close up view of a man using the weight loss injection Mounjaro on his belly." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03766-2/d41586-025-03766-2_51719060.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro act on GLP-1 receptors in the brain to regulate appetite. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Oliver Berg/dpa via Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obesity drug tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro or Zepbound, can suppress patterns of brain activity associated with food cravings, a study suggests. Researchers measured the changing electrical signals in the brain of a person with severe obesity who had experienced persistent ‘food noise’ — intrusive, compulsive thoughts about eating — shortly after the individual began taking the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is the first to use electrodes to directly measure how &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04505-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04505-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;blockbuster obesity drugs that mimic the hormone GLP-1&lt;/a&gt; affect brain activity in people, and to hint at how they curb extreme food cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a great strategy to try and find a neural signature of food noise, and then try to understand how drugs can manipulate it,” says Amber Alhadeff, a neuroscientist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The findings were published today in &lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bonus finding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casey Halpern, a neurosurgeon-scientist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and his colleagues did not set out to investigate the effects of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02092-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02092-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;obesity drugs&lt;/a&gt; on the brain. The team’s goal was to test whether a type of deep brain stimulation — a therapy that involves delivering a weak electrical current directly into the brain — can help to reduce compulsive eating in people with obesity for whom treatments such as bariatric surgery haven’t worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01770-0" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03766-2/d41586-025-03766-2_51124480.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How to keep weight off after obesity drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists set up a study in which participants had an electrode implanted into their nucleus accumbens, a region of the brain that is involved in feelings of reward. It also expresses the GLP-1 receptor, notes Christian Hölscher, a neuroscientist at the Henan Academy of Innovations in Medical Science in Zhengzhou, China, “so we know that GLP-1 plays a role in modulating reward here”. This type of electrode, which can both record electrical activity and deliver an electrical current when needed, is already used in people to treat some forms of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study’s first two participants, the researchers found that episodes of intense food noise were accompanied by a surge in low-frequency brain activity. This pattern suggested that these changes could serve as a measurable sign of compulsive food cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third trial participant, a 60-year-old woman, had just started taking a high dose of tirzepatide — which had been prescribed by her physician to treat type 2 diabetes — when she had the electrode implanted. “We took advantage of this serendipitous opportunity because of the excitement around these drugs,” Halpern says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Food noise silenced&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Bird flu hasn’t gone anywhere, and it’s still sickening Americans. Health officials in Washington have confirmed that a resident contracted a nasty bout of H5N5 avian influenza—the first known case of its kind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Washington State Department of Health &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/newsroom/grays-harbor-county-resident-tests-preliminarily-positive-avian-influenza"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the case late last week. The victim is an older adult who was likely exposed to the virus through contact with their backyard chickens or wild birds. Though the variant may not have spread beyond this case, the resident remains hospitalized, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Public health disease experts have not identified any increased risk to the public,” the health department said in its latest statement &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/newsroom/h5n5-avian-influenza-confirmed-grays-harbor-county-resident"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;First of its kind&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials initially reported the case last Thursday, which involved a resident living in Grays Harbor County. The next day, they confirmed the variant as H5N5. Though H5N5 has been found in birds and other animals before, this is the first known report of human illness from the variant.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The person developed a high fever, confusion, and respiratory distress and was hospitalized sometime in early November. Aside from their older age, the person’s history of underlying health conditions may have contributed to the infection’s severity. The person owns a mixed backyard flock of domestic chickens that had previously come into contact with wild birds, which likely served as the source of exposure. But health and wildlife officials are still working to unravel the exact chain of transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The ongoing danger of bird flu&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While this might be the first time H5N5 has jumped into humans, bird flu in general has become a more pressing threat in recent years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In early 2024, health officials &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/bird-flu-h5n1-found-in-cow-milk-texas-and-kansas-1851366354"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the discovery of H5N1 cases in cows on several dairy farms in Texas and Kansas. Since then, H5N1 has repeatedly infected dairy cows, other mammals, and sometimes people. There have been at least 71 human cases of H5N1 in the U.S., along with one death. Just this past September, USDA officials &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/agency-announcements/usda-confirms-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-dairy-herd-nebraska"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; yet another outbreak of H5N1 at a dairy farm in Nebraska.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the risks posed by H5N1 or other bird flu strains like H5N5 are low to the general public for now, these outbreaks are still highly concerning. The longer these flu viruses are able to circulate in mammals like dairy cows, the greater the odds that a strain will evolve to efficiently spread between humans. If such a strain could transmit easily from human to human while causing serious illness, that would set the stage for the next big pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This latest human case of H5N5 may just be a dead end. But eventually, we might not be so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Popular drugs for diabetes and weight loss, like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro, can have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/not-just-weight-loss-8-conditions-drugs-like-wegovy-might-treat"&gt;profound impacts&lt;/a&gt; on the body, but what about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-type-drugs-may-trigger-brain-changes-linked-to-depression"&gt;the brain&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These medicines are thought to broadly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/staggering-results-of-new-weight-loss-drugs-may-be-revolutionary-expert-says"&gt;suppress appetite&lt;/a&gt; and enhance feelings of fullness, but the actual way they achieve that in the human brain is poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first in-human investigation of its kind has found that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirzepatide"&gt;tirzepatide&lt;/a&gt; (brand name: Mounjaro) may modulate a specific brain signal, possibly involved in dysregulated eating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drugs-like-ozempic-quieten-food-noise-in-our-brains-study-finds"&gt;Drugs Like Ozempic Quieten 'Food Noise,' in Our Brains, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study included three participants with severe obesity who had difficulty controlling their eating habits and hadn't responded to previous &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-2-crucial-things-to-track-for-lasting-weight-loss"&gt;weight loss treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When participants were dealing with intense thoughts of food or cravings, researchers found a part of their brains, called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens"&gt;nucleus accumbens,&lt;/a&gt; produced stronger delta-theta signals. These signals are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1712214114"&gt;involved&lt;/a&gt; in the reward system of the mammal brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All three patients had previously received &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/analysis-of-weight-loss-surgery-data-reveals-there-are-actually-4-types-of-obesity"&gt;bariatric surgery&lt;/a&gt;, yet they continued to experience distressing food preoccupation. Two of the participants began &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01941-w"&gt;deep-brain stimulation&lt;/a&gt; of the nucleus accumbens, while the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;third participant had been prescribed tirzepatide for their type 2 diabetes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;rain activity was measured in all three participants using electrodes that had been inserted into their nucleus accumbens. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, the third participant had their tirzepatide dose upped around the same time as their brain implant surgery. For the next four months, not counting the first, the patient experienced a "profoundly" low number of 'severe food preoccupation' episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this time, when she did have food cravings, the delta–theta activity in her nucleus accumbens was indistinguishable from times when 'food noise' wasn't experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was markedly different from the other participants. But the benefits sadly didn't last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181149" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181149" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TimelineTirzepatide-642x312.png" alt="Tirzepatide Timeline" class="size-medium wp-image-181149" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TimelineTirzepatide-642x312.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TimelineTirzepatide-1200x583.png 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TimelineTirzepatide-768x373.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TimelineTirzepatide-1536x747.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TimelineTirzepatide-600x292.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TimelineTirzepatide.png 2032w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181149" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The third participant started taking tirzepatide for their  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="181128" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; 4 months before they had a brain implant inserted.

What scientists can glean from the results without a control group is limited.

During the brighter seasons I feel fine, but when winter comes and the light begins to fade, I start drooping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I have struggled with seasonal affective disorder (Sad) since I was a teenager. The &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder-sad/overview/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;symptoms of Sad&lt;/a&gt; are similar to regular depression, with low moods and lethargy, and can be equally debilitating. Over the years I’ve experienced the full Sad spectrum, from moments of excessive tiredness and carb cravings (yes, those are official Sad symptoms), to a low point of breaking down crying on the kitchen floor after school because it was so cold, dark and bleak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I’ve always struggled to enjoy the cosiness of early winter when Sad feels like a curse waiting to pounce, like an inevitable winter bug that lasts all season. But maybe it didn’t have to be this way? Sick of losing months of my life to the gloom every winter, one year I decided to do a deep dive into the science of Sad and even spoke to a serious-faced Finnish scientist about it for a feature I was writing. His advice? Sit yourself down in front of a light box emitting 10,000 lux, for up to an hour, at least five times a week. Eight out of 10 people will have good results with this, the Finn explained, and you should start a couple of weeks before the symptoms usually kick in. And do it in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="af77d3c5-4620-4137-8d8d-85b41cf4b6b8" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;The stock advice for Sad is to ‘get light’.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: courtesy of Jessica Furseth&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At first it seemed too simple – the stock advice for Sad is to “get light”, but I’d tried Sad lamps and lunchtime walks before, with little success. But I didn’t realise the timing is so crucial: you have to get that light into your eyeballs soon after waking – before 10am – because the whole point is to help your circadian rhythm. The darkness sets people with Sad adrift because our bodies can’t keep track of the time, and the body clock affects so much, from hormones, hunger, digestion and immune function to alertness, memory and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I was desperate, so I decided to follow the instructions to the letter. I bought new bulbs for my 10-year-old Sad lamps and rigged them up on either side of myself in a window seat that gets the morning sun, or at least an overcast approximation. Last winter I sat myself down there first thing every morning to read a book in the blinding light, coffee in hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I was honestly shocked how well it worked. I still had the occasional gloomy day, but thanks to my new light routine, I mostly felt like myself. Instead of sinking into tiredness as the afternoons grew shorter, I was ready to take on the day. I could skip the occasional morning without any ill effects, but I soon felt myself drawn to the light because I knew it would brighten me up, especially on a rainy day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As winter progressed I realised the light went far beyond just giving me energy to get through the day – I also had the energy to have fun. Instead of preferring a blanket on the sofa most January nights, I found myself keen to go out for dinners and dancing on the weekends. Best of all, I was able to appreciate how beautiful winter can be, when you’re awake enough to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Now winter is almost here again, I’m back in front of the bright window, and I’m no longer afraid of the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7AFBVV95cUxNQ3NkU1VaaXJtS2JXeFA3eTcwRGtHbE5JQVVFbTRLeHZOMjQxZHFVejV1M2w2VVFMZGIzLVZCZDFSLUdiZGN5bW5TWWJvNG4tQzQzd3pQN2pSLTNzdVBleDl2VGpyVWlxekZqTk0wLV9zX1pBRkVaZjJlSnlRUUVjV2k5OUZjTjQ0SUttdHFJNVgyMHFmWUJIX3ZxV1FFODk2TGZUay1WN3IwZUJBdGNSTGRzUndabFZ0WDNmMDZEVjBIajRsUDVZU3lrTnZLaGJpR0FJc3NENWRPQ1ZhYmFnSUJTaFU5Mkkydm9WUA</guid></item><item><title>全脂乳制品更健康吗？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/well/eat/whole-milk-dairy-health-effects.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:35:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQZnByX0RqajdzOXRWaW9EOUk2QlMyaEszalVpTkNYVzR0ZVFRWlhrYWtxaTNaZTJYX3hJc3FCZzBSelAtcl9rLWU3aFVrY3poRFBoc1lTNEVHanhVTndwZ0pNSXdiVVhCUkl2NVlUNFY3a2U4WGpnTmxPR0RiMGxkd1Uzak1NX3M</guid></item><item><title>世界上第一个，以色列科学家使用基于RNA的基因疗法来阻止ALS恶化-以色列时报</title><link>https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-world-first-israeli-scientists-use-rna-based-gene-therapy-to-stop-als-deterioration/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="the-content"&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking study, researchers at Tel Aviv University, leading a large-scale international team of scientists, say they have identified – and neutralized – an RNA molecule that can stop the nerve cell damage that causes paralysis in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now they hope they can use the discovery to help patients with the fatal illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we added a specific RNA molecule to human cells and animal models for ALS, the nerve cells stopped degenerating and even regenerated,” said Prof. Eran Perlson from the Gray Faculty of Medical &amp;amp; Health Sciences and the Sagol School of Neuroscience at Tel Aviv University, speaking to The Times of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Their study, recently published in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02062-6"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, opens a new avenue for treating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to get to the root of the matter of what causes ALS to enable the development of effective drugs for this incurable disease,” Perlson said. The team used mice that had been genetically modified to serve as a “biological stand-in” for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="In world first, Israeli scientists use RNA-based gene therapy to stop ALS deterioration"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Dr. Ariel Ionescu, Dr. Lior Ankol, and lab manager Tal Pery Gradus in collaboration with Dr. Amir Dori, Senior Neurologist and Head of the Neuromuscular Disease Unit at Sheba Medical Center. Additional participants included researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, and research institutions in France, Turkey, and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;About ALS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALS, sometimes called Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a fatal neurodegenerative condition that affects motor neurons — the nerve cells that control muscle movement. Over time, the disease causes gradual paralysis of all muscles in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients typically lose their ability to walk, speak, swallow, and breathe, often becoming completely paralyzed while their cognitive skills remain intact.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;“Most patients die within three to five years of diagnosis, due to paralysis of the diaphragm muscles and respiratory failure,” said Perlson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently some 600 ALS patients in Israel, according to &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/circumventing-israeli-law-judge-okays-als-patients-right-to-die/"&gt;Efrat Carmi&lt;/a&gt;, CEO for IsrALS, the Israeli Research Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ALS, the neuromuscular junctions, where nerve fibers meet muscle cells and transmit electrical signals from the brain to the muscles, are disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perlson stated that the molecular mechanisms underlying this damage had remained unknown until now.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3690407" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/2.-Illustration.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3690407" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/2.-Illustration-640x400.jpeg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The microRNA that causes trouble in ALS patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study continues research from Perlson’s lab about microRNAs, the small molecules that regulate the translation of proteins and play an important role in many other cellular processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an earlier &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-scientists-say-step-taken-toward-finding-treatment-of-lou-gehrig-disease/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, Perlson and his team found that a protein called TDP-43 formed toxic clusters at the tip of the nerve, where it meets the muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;In healthy bodies, the TDP-43 helps regulate how proteins are made in cells. But in ALS, it becomes unstable. To find out why this happens, the researchers studied tissues from ALS patients, mice that mimic having the disease, and human stem cell cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their experiments revealed that muscle cells produce tiny RNA molecules called microRNA-126.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The muscle cells then send them in tiny bubbles, called vesicles, across the small gap between nerve and muscle cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These microRNAs act like messengers that tell the nerve cells when to stop making TDP-43. Without the microRNA, TDP-43 continues to build up and becomes toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We discovered that in ALS, the muscle produces a smaller amount of microRNA-126,” said Ionescu. The decrease in this microRNA leads to an increase in the dangerous TDP-43.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_1626732" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2017/05/Lou-Geh.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-1626732" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2017/05/Lou-Geh-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excessive TDP-43 then forms toxic clusters. These clumps attack the mitochondria, the essential molecules inside cells that turn food and oxygen into energy so the cell can work, move, and stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The damage is so great that it gradually destroys motor neurons, “leaving patients’ muscles paralyzed,” Ionescu said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when the researchers added extra microRNA-126 to tissues from ALS patients and to mice with the disease, the process reversed.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zevik Melamed, the principal investigator at the Laboratory of Molecular and Translational Neuroscience at Hebrew University of Jerusalem’s Faculty of Medicine, said the study “suggests that protecting communication between muscles and nerves might be just as important as targeting neurons directly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a real shift in how we think about preventing paralysis in ALS,” Melamed, who was not involved in the study, told The Times of Israel in a written comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study can be the basis for gene therapy for ALS, Perlson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The next step is taking it to clinical trials,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

A winter chill, a dusty room or a simple viral infection can trigger a cough that settles within a few days. But when that cough lingers long after the usual remedies, it may be signalling something more important than a passing cold. Doctors describe any cough lasting longer than eight weeks in adults as a “chronic cough”, and a peer-reviewed medical review published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430791/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;StatPearls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; highlights that persistent coughing is often linked to hidden issues such as asthma, reflux disease, heart problems, or chronic lung conditions. Ignoring it might delay a diagnosis your body is trying desperately to alert you to. A lingering cough always deserves attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why a lingering cough should never be ignored&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often expect a cough to disappear as quietly as it arrived. But if it stays for weeks or becomes a daily pattern, it is no longer behaving like an ordinary symptom of a cold. According to respiratory experts, a persistent cough can be the first visible sign of issues affecting your lungs, throat, sinuses or even your heart. The reason doctors take chronic cough seriously is simple: the body rarely keeps coughing without a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Understanding what is driving that reflex can prevent more serious complications later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Winter diseases you must be careful about as days get colder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Common medical causes behind a cough that won’t go away&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cough that refuses to calm down is usually connected to one of several underlying conditions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Post-nasal drip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinus congestion sends mucus down the back of the throat, irritating the airway and triggering constant throat clearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Asthma and cough variant asthma:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people experience coughing rather than wheezing, making asthma harder to recognise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GERD):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acid rising into the throat can irritate the vocal cords and cause a dry, nagging cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Chronic bronchitis or COPD:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often seen in smokers or former smokers, this involves long term inflammation of the airways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Lung infections and scarring:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after an infection resolves, leftover inflammation can continue to trigger coughing spells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Heart-related issues:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluid buildup in the lungs from heart failure can cause a persistent, breathless cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding which category your symptoms fall into helps guide proper treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The warning signs that a stubborn cough could be serious&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many chronic coughs are linked to treatable causes, certain symptoms should be taken seriously. Seek medical help if your cough is accompanied by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coughing up blood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain or chest tightness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath that keeps getting worse&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unexplained weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Night sweats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A hoarse voice lasting more than three weeks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swollen ankles or persistent fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These can be signs of conditions such as heart disease, tuberculosis, lung cancer or severe respiratory infections.

A typical evaluation includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A detailed medical and lifestyle history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Listening to the chest for wheezing or crackles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Checking the throat and sinuses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest X-ray or CT scan if needed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lung function tests for asthma or COPD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assessing for reflux disease if heartburn or throat irritation is present&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood tests if infection or inflammation is suspected&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, referral to a pulmonologist, ENT specialist or gastroenterologist may be needed.

Whether the cause is mild or serious, a persistent cough should always be treated as a message worth listening to. Early intervention can prevent long-term complications, improve breathing, and offer peace of mind. Instead of waiting for it to fade, act early and protect your health.

Certain foods can raise your &lt;a href="/topic/heart-rate"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt;, spike your &lt;a href="/topic/temperature"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt; or mess with the &lt;a href="/topic/hormones"&gt;hormones&lt;/a&gt; that regulate rest, while others can lull you into slumber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can’t fall asleep or struggle to stay asleep, &lt;a href="/topic/salt"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt; could be the root of the issue,” says Dr Katherine Hall, a sleep psychologist from Somnus Therapy. “Sodium-rich meals result in fluid retention and increased blood pressure, making it hard for the body to switch off completely after eating snacks like crisps or salted nuts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt doesn’t just make you thirsty. It actually changes the body’s ability to rest. “This then results in something called superficial sleep, where the sleep isn’t very deep and can often involve disturbances like going to the toilet more, as studies show this can be brought on more by too much salt in the &lt;a href="/topic/diet"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The culprit, Dr Hall explains, is your blood pressure and fluid balance. A high-sodium meal essentially keeps your body in alert mode. You might fall asleep quickly after that post-pub kebab, but your system won’t fully switch off – which is why you’ll likely wake up groggy, parched and wondering why you feel as though you’ve barely slept. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Deborah Lee, from Dr Fox Online Pharmacy, agrees that our digestive systems bear the brunt of late-night indulgence. “When we eat spicy, salty or acidic foods too close to bedtime, our digestive system has to work harder when it should be winding down,” she says. “Spicy foods can raise body temperature and stimulate the release of certain stress hormones, both of which can make it harder to fall asleep. Acidic meals and high salt intake can also trigger heartburn or acid reflux, especially when lying down, which disrupts the natural sleep cycle.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about what you eat, but when. “It’s a good idea to leave at least two to three hours between your last meal and going to bed,” adds Dr Lee. “This allows time for digestion and helps prevent reflux. However, it’s not just about the clock: your overall dietary pattern plays a big role too. A diet that’s high in processed, salty or spicy foods can increase inflammation and affect sleep quality over time, even if eaten earlier in the day.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bHmhpR"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/03/12/14/iStock-1344307329.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/03/12/14/iStock-1344307329.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/03/12/14/iStock-1344307329.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="That late-night curry might hit the spot – but it could be keeping you up" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-458468"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;That late-night curry might hit the spot – but it could be keeping you up&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to assume that eating light or “clean” before bed will help you sleep, but some of the worst offenders hide behind a halo of health. Tomatoes, soy sauce, aubergines, red wine and cheeses, for instance, are all rich in tyramine, an amino acid that can overstimulate the brain. “Tyramine is an amino acid that is normally a great addition to anyone’s diet as it stimulates natural brain activity,” says Dr Hall. “For those of us looking to get more sleep, however, it’s something to avoid completely if possible. Tyramine stimulates the production of norepinephrine, triggering the ‘fight-or-flight’ response and sending your body into a hyper-aroused state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If salt and acid rev up your blood pressure and digestion, spice messes with something even more primal: your temperature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For anyone struggling to sleep, avoid spicy foods altogether,” says Dr Hall. “Digesting various spices and chillies you have in your curries or other hot dishes can severely disrupt our body’s ability to thermoregulate, which essentially means managing our temperature. Capsaicin is the chemical in spicy &lt;a href="/topic/food"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; that causes our temperature to skyrocket, so combine this with the energy your body needs to digest the remainder of the meal, and you can really struggle getting some solid sleep.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body naturally cools as we approach sleep – it’s part of our circadian rhythm – so raising your core temperature with a fiery curry or hot sauce-laden dinner is like flicking the lights back on just as you’re nodding off. Dr Lee adds that spicy food can also stimulate the release of stress hormones, keeping the body alert when it should be winding down. Combine that with the reflux risk of lying down too soon after eating, and you’ve got a recipe for a restless night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1wzq3bw-0 sc-1wzq3bw-3 kqnNdl gGuqvP"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-i07cwn-0 dvtoxw"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" id="7b73b88eb27c89ab" viewbox="0 0 80 47"&gt;&lt;path fill="#eb1426" d="M21.18 46.99c9.4 0 17.18-7.73 17.18-17.13 0-9.46-7.72-17.12-17.12-17.12A17.2 17.2 0 0 0 3.99 29.86c0 3.74 1.29 7.47 3.48 10.5l-.13.12A23.6 23.6 0 0 1 1.29 24.4c0-12.75 10.36-23.3 23.1-23.3a24 24 0 0 1 11.53 2.89l.57-.96A26 26 0 0 0 24.33 0 24.3 24.3 0 0 0 0 24.4c0 14.09 9.72 22.59 21.18 22.59m41.47 0c9.4 0 17.18-7.73 17.18-17.13 0-9.46-7.72-17.12-17.12-17.12a17.2 17.2 0 0 0-17.25 17.12c0 3.74 1.29 7.47 3.48 10.5l-.13.12a23.6 23.6 0 0 1-6.05-16.08c0-12.75 10.36-23.3 23.1-23.3a24 24 0 0 1 11.53 2.89l.58-.96A26 26 0 0 0 65.8 0a24.33 24.33 0 0 0-24.33 24.4c0 14.09 9.72 22.59 21.18 22.59"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classic ‘sleepy’ foods like bananas, almonds, milk and chamomile tea all contain or promote compounds such as magnesium, calcium and tryptophan, which can help the body relax&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wzq3bw-4 gIguDj"&gt;Dr Deborah Lee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that while some foods sabotage sleep, others can actively support it. “Meals rich in complex carbohydrates, lean protein and healthy fats support the production of melatonin and serotonin: the hormones that regulate sleep and mood,” says Dr Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Classic ‘sleepy’ foods like bananas, almonds, milk and chamomile tea all contain or promote compounds such as magnesium, calcium and tryptophan, which can help the body relax.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the high-sodium, high-spice dinners that raise your heart rate and body temperature, these foods work in harmony with your circadian rhythm. Bananas and almonds are rich in magnesium and potassium – minerals that help relax muscles and calm the nervous system – while milk provides tryptophan, the amino acid used to produce serotonin and melatonin. Chamomile tea contains apigenin, a natural compound that binds to brain receptors to encourage drowsiness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Lee says magnesium, in particular, is one of the most important nutrients for rest. “It supports relaxation and helps regulate the body’s stress response,” she explains. “Tryptophan and vitamin B6 are also key players, as they’re needed to make serotonin and melatonin. Zinc and calcium play supportive roles too: they’re involved in neurotransmitter function and help the brain transition into deeper sleep stages.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been flirting with magnesium supplements or fancy teas, you could just start with your diet. Think leafy greens, nuts, seeds and whole grains. These foods don’t just set you up for better rest at night – they also help regulate energy and mood throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we often think of sleep as something that happens at night, Dr Lee emphasises that the groundwork is laid long before bedtime. “When blood sugar levels fluctuate too much throughout the day, it can make it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep,” she says. “Spikes and crashes can trigger cortisol, a stress hormone that keeps us alert. Balanced meals that combine protein, fibre and healthy fats help maintain steady energy levels, which sets the stage for more useful sleep later.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/03/12/40/iStock-696544568.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/03/12/40/iStock-696544568.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/03/12/40/iStock-696544568.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A humble banana before bed?

Science says it might just help you sleep&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut health plays a role, too. “The gut and brain are in constant communication through the vagus nerve, and a healthy gut microbiome supports the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin,” says Dr Lee. “Poor gut health, from stress, poor diet or lack of fibre, can interfere with this process and lead to disrupted sleep. A diet rich in prebiotic fibre, fermented foods and diverse plant foods supports both gut and sleep health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re genuinely hungry before bed, don’t panic – the goal isn’t to go to sleep starving. “A small, balanced snack can be helpful,” says Dr Lee. “Try something light like Greek yoghurt with berries, a banana with a spoon of nut butter or wholegrain toast with hummus. These options provide slow-release carbohydrates and a bit of protein to keep blood sugar steady without overloading digestion.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can still enjoy dinner out with friends or the occasional spicy meal, but moderation and timing are key. As Dr Lee puts it, “Sleep shouldn’t come at the expense of your social life: the key is balance. If you’re having a late meal or a glass of wine, try to drink plenty of water, eat slowly and finish eating at least two hours before bed. If it’s a particularly heavy or spicy meal, a short walk afterwards can help digestion and reduce reflux risk.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no single superfood or quick fix that guarantees a perfect night’s rest, but there is a pattern: balance. Heavy, salty or spicy foods overstimulate the body, while those rich in fibre, magnesium and tryptophan soothe it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So before you reach for another glass of red or raid the crisp cupboard, remember: your best night’s sleep might not begin in the bedroom, but in the kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 12:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxPaTEzMUtLX05JTDNiZDZmWG5YU3Z5ZExlcEE5ZlE0dFRwR29haW1JX1c0cjlJR2JITWFmRUhUOW9Qd1N2RVhkTjhuRWE2SktwQkVzYmdTWlRVdDNDQWFoTFY4My0yQ2dKZEh6US15Sm9SSXJBTzQ3d1RmZ2dienlzdUUtdk5vNWhGTlNRc2RxSVVIdUNhQkZaRHAwWFRaY0ZkMlJNVVg2cmhvaTAtZVpTdDN4eDFUdw</guid></item><item><title>一种常见的糖尿病药物与女性的“卓越长寿”有关- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-diabetes-drug-is-linked-to-exceptional-longevity-in-women</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Not only can the drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt; help to effectively manage type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="181787" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, but it may also give older women a better chance of living to the grand old age of 90, according to recent research – thanks, it seems, to a variety of anti-aging effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists in the US and Germany used data from a long-term US study of postmenopausal women. Records on a total of 438 people were picked out – half of whom took metformin to treat diabetes, and half who took a different &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-confirms-experimental-drug-breaks-record-for-weight-loss-in-clinical-trials"&gt;diabetes drug&lt;/a&gt;, called sulfonylurea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are some caveats and asterisks to the study, those in the metformin group were calculated to have a 30 percent lower risk of dying before the age of 90 than those in the sulfonylurea group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/after-60-years-diabetes-drug-found-to-unexpectedly-impact-the-brain"&gt;After 60 Years, Diabetes Drug Found to Unexpectedly Impact The Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Metformin has been shown to target multiple pathways of aging and therefore has been postulated as a drug that may extend human longevity," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaf095"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that metformin initiation increased exceptional longevity compared with sulfonylurea initiation among women with type 2 diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metformin has been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-diabetes-drug-will-be-trialled-as-an-anti-ageing-elixir-from-next-year"&gt;around for decades&lt;/a&gt; and is considered a gerotherapeutic: a drug able to slow down various aging processes in the body.

However, scientists aren't yet sure that the drug extends lifespan, especially in humans – which is part of the reason for this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research can't prove cause and effect like a randomized controlled trial (RCT) might be able to, because the participants weren't randomly assigned to one treatment or the other – rather, they were following professional advice. What's more, there wasn't a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;placebo group&lt;/a&gt;, given no treatment. The overall sample size wasn't particularly large, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also has its strengths – for example, the average follow-up period was 14 to 15 years, extending far beyond the length a standard RCT would be able to. That's important to understand how any intervention impacts lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A key advantage of our analysis was the long follow-up period after treatment initiation enabled by examination of a cohort with extensive follow-up from midlife to ages 90 and older, which is not feasible in typical randomized controlled trials," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaf095"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-five-simple-habits-are-key-to-slowing-aging-experts-reveal"&gt;These Five Simple Habits Are Key to Slowing Aging, Experts Reveal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RCTs could follow further down the line to dig deeper into these results, the researchers suggest.

    &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Many women use exercise, diet changes and supplements for menopause symptoms, but a new study suggests self-pleasure may belong in that toolkit too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Researchers at the Kinsey Institute surveyed peri- and postmenopausal women and found that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/GME.0000000000002675" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;masturbation was among the highest-rated symptom-management methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Self-pleasure matters in menopause care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Surveys show that almost 90% of medical trainees &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378512222001803" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;feel unprepared to support patients through menopause&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;, and many women say they receive little information from their healthcare providers. Although menopause has had a rise in media coverage, research and clinical training still lag behind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;









&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Graham and the team set out to learn how often women use masturbation to manage symptoms, how effective they believe it is compared with other approaches and how willing they might be to try it if a clinician suggested it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Masturbation and menopause symptoms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;The researchers ran an online survey designed to reflect the demographics of women aged 40–65 years across the US. Participants completed questions about menopause symptoms, self-pleasure, sexual history and other symptom-management strategies. Only women who were peri- or postmenopausal were included in the final analysis, resulting in a sample of 1,178 people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;The survey asked about 15 symptom-management strategies, including masturbation, and participants rated how helpful each approach was on a 5-point scale. They also reported which of 19 symptoms improved after masturbation. A set of questions explored doctor–patient conversations about menopause and sexual health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;The team found that masturbation is not widely used as a symptom-management tool. Around 13.5% of perimenopausal women and 9.7% of postmenopausal women said they used it for symptom relief; however, 19.5% of the overall sample had never masturbated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Yet the women who did use it rated it highly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Perimenopausal participants gave self-pleasure an average score of 4.35 out of 5, which was similar to partnered sex, sex toy use and hormone therapy, and higher than many lifestyle changes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;“Nearly one in five perimenopausal and postmenopausal women had noticed that self-pleasure provided symptom relief,” explained the authors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;When asked about specific symptoms, almost half of the perimenopausal women and one-third of postmenopausal women reported improvements in at least one symptom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Perimenopausal women most often cited improvements in mood swings, falling asleep and irritability, and postmenopausal women pointed to sleep problems and mood shifts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Smaller groups reported benefits for lubrication, pain, desire and headaches, and only 2.7% reported worsening symptoms, often linked to poor health or difficulty reaching orgasm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Despite only 7% of perimenopausal and 4% of postmenopausal women having ever discussed masturbation with a clinician, many said they would try it if they knew it could help – and more than half would do so if a clinician recommended it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;How self-pleasure could fit into future menopause treatment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Self-pleasure is accessible, low-cost, and, based on the findings, may support mood and sleep in menopausal women.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;“Our findings suggest masturbation may play a meaningful role in symptom management,” said Graham.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;It could work alongside hormone therapy, lubricants, moisturizers or behavioral approaches, adding another option for women tailoring their own care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Menopause still receives limited attention in medical training, and sexual well-being is often missing from appointments. This study highlights a need for clearer communication around self-pleasure. Bringing sexual health into routine menopause care may help clinicians offer a broader set of options.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;However, all data were self-reported, and therefore, the links between self-pleasure and symptom changes cannot be considered causal. There were no physiological measures to track sleep quality, hormone changes or body temperature, and menopause status was based on participant reports, which can be inaccurate without clinical assessment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Future work would benefit from controlled studies that test cause and effect, including trials that track sleep latency or hot flash frequency. Physiological monitoring would add clarity, as would long-term studies following women through the menopause transition. Research in different cultural settings is also needed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;“While managing menopause is something that necessitates a custom solution to each woman based on her unique health and needs, doctors and other health care providers should be cognizant of the valuable role that masturbation may play in symptom relief,” the authors concluded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Many women use exercise, diet changes and supplements for menopause symptoms, but a new study suggests self-pleasure may belong in that toolkit too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Researchers at the Kinsey Institute surveyed peri- and postmenopausal women and found that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/GME.0000000000002675" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;masturbation was among the highest-rated symptom-management methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Self-pleasure matters in menopause care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Surveys show that almost 90% of medical trainees &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378512222001803" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;feel unprepared to support patients through menopause&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;, and many women say they receive little information from their healthcare providers. Although menopause has had a rise in media coverage, research and clinical training still lag behind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;









&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;“Menopause is important to research for many reasons, one of which is that most women going through perimenopause experience several symptoms that have been described by women as ‘highly disruptive and intolerable,’” said the authors of the latest study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;These symptoms range from sleep problems and mood changes to vaginal dryness and pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Smaller groups reported benefits for lubrication, pain, desire and headaches, and only 2.7% reported worsening symptoms, often linked to poor health or difficulty reaching orgasm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Despite only 7% of perimenopausal and 4% of postmenopausal women having ever discussed masturbation with a clinician, many said they would try it if they knew it could help – and more than half would do so if a clinician recommended it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;How self-pleasure could fit into future menopause treatment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Self-pleasure is accessible, low-cost, and, based on the findings, may support mood and sleep in menopausal women.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;“Our findings suggest masturbation may play a meaningful role in symptom management,” said Graham.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;It could work alongside hormone therapy, lubricants, moisturizers or behavioral approaches, adding another option for women tailoring their own care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Menopause still receives limited attention in medical training, and sexual well-being is often missing from appointments. This study highlights a need for clearer communication around self-pleasure. Bringing sexual health into routine menopause care may help clinicians offer a broader set of options.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;However, all data were self-reported, and therefore, the links between self-pleasure and symptom changes cannot be considered causal. There were no physiological measures to track sleep quality, hormone changes or body temperature, and menopause status was based on participant reports, which can be inaccurate without clinical assessment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Future work would benefit from controlled studies that test cause and effect, including trials that track sleep latency or hot flash frequency. Physiological monitoring would add clarity, as would long-term studies following women through the menopause transition. Research in different cultural settings is also needed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;“While managing menopause is something that necessitates a custom solution to each woman based on her unique health and needs, doctors and other health care providers should be cognizant of the valuable role that masturbation may play in symptom relief,” the authors concluded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A street lamp outside your window, the orange charging light on a plug adapter next to your nightstand, a flash of your phone late at night indicating you’ve received an email—these artificial light sources would never occur in nature, and recent studies suggest they harm your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher levels of artificial light at night were linked to increased stress-related activity in the brain, inflamed arteries, and a higher risk of heart disease, according to a preliminary study presented at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial light at night, or nighttime light pollution, is a nearly universal feature of modern cities, according to the study. This first-of-its-kind study reviewed brain scans and satellite images to show a biological pathway linking nighttime light exposure to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that environmental factors, such as air and noise pollution, can lead to heart disease by affecting our nerves and blood vessels through stress. Light pollution is very common; however, we don’t know much about how it affects the heart,” &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/exposure-to-more-artificial-light-at-night-may-raise-heart-disease-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; study senior author Shady Abohashem, head of cardiac PET/CT imaging trials at Massachusetts General Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;450 adult patients underwent identical PET/CT scans, and all of whom were without heart disease and no active cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a routine imaging test at my hospital,” Abohashem said. “The CT portion provides detailed anatomy, while the PET portion reveals metabolic activity in tissues. Using both imaging techniques together allows for the measurement of brain stress activity and arterial inflammation in a single scan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis found that people exposed to higher levels of artificial light at night had higher brain stress activity, blood vessel inflammation and a higher risk of major heart events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This information was collected from medical records and evaluated by two cardiologists who were blinded, meaning they were unaware of any information that could influence their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greater the artificial night light exposure, the higher the risk of heart disease development. Every standard deviation increase in light exposure was associated with about 35% and 22% increased risk of heart disease over five- and 10-year follow-up periods, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These associations remained after accounting for traditional risk factors and other socio-environmental exposures like noise pollution and socioeconomic status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, these heart risks were higher among participants who lived in areas with additional social or environmental stress, such as high traffic noise or lower neighborhood income. Over a 10-year follow-up period, 17% of participants had major heart conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIOHACKING STOIRES: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Device from MIT Startup Helps People Fall Asleep–Putting Your Mind on ‘Do Not Disturb’" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/device-from-mit-startup-helps-people-fall-asleep-putting-your-brain-on-do-not-disturb/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Device from MIT Startup Helps People Fall Asleep–Putting Your Mind on ‘Do Not Disturb’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We found a nearly linear relationship between nighttime light and heart disease: the more night-light exposure, the higher the risk. Even modest increases in night-time light were linked with higher brain and artery stress,” Abohashem said. “When the brain perceives stress, it activates signals that can trigger an immune response and inflame the blood vessels. Over time, this process can contribute to hardening of the arteries and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to counter the effects of artificial light at night, he suggested that cities could reduce unnecessary outdoor lighting, shield streetlamps or use motion-sensitive lights. On a personal level, “people can limit indoor nighttime light, keeping bedrooms dark and avoiding screens such as TVs and personal electronic devices before bed,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RETURN TO NATURE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="A Daycare Rewilded its Yard and the Children Became Healthier: Now the Whole Nation Is Doing it" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/a-daycare-rewilded-its-yard-and-the-children-became-healthier-now-the-whole-nation-is-doing-it/" rel="bookmark"&gt;A Daycare Rewilded its Yard and the Children Became Healthier: Now the Whole Nation Is Doing it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings are novel and add to the evidence suggesting that reducing exposure to excessive artificial light at night is a public health concern,” said Julio Fernandez-Mendoza, director of behavioral sleep medicine at Pennsylvania State University, Hershey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study had several strengths, including using state-of-the-art PET/CT imaging to measure brain stress and artery inflammation, combined with satellite light data and long-term follow-up for heart events. The CT/PET scans allowed them to see the inflammation coalesce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the study also has several limitations. Importantly, it is an observational study, an analysis of previously collected information; therefore, it cannot prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship between any of the variables reviewed. Second, the study included participants who received health care at only one hospital system, which means the participant group may not represent a diverse group of people, and the findings cannot be generalized to represent a larger population group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know too much exposure to artificial light at night can harm your health, particularly increasing the risk of heart disease. However, we did not know how this harm happened,” Fernandez-Mendoza said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in her 60s, Ford had been diagnosed with lupus years earlier. It’s a mysterious autoimmune disease that drives inflammation as the body’s own immune system fights tissue and organs instead of foreign intruders like viruses and bacteria. Symptoms are a rollercoaster, from hair loss to joint pain that afflicted Ford so badly that she had to quit the job she loved. Strange rashes also broke out on her legs — then quickly disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 1.5 million Americans have lupus and almost all — 90% — are women  There is no cure. Treatments may relieve symptoms, but the troubling side effects can include osteoporosis and eye damage. More rarely, lupus can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a fun disease&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; at all,” said Ford, now 77, who lives in the northern Solano County city of Dixon. “You never know when it’s going to exacerbate. And for no reason.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-94amudz6" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_94amudz6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cause of lupus has eluded medical researchers for decades. But this week a team of Stanford Medicine researchers claim they’ve cracked the code, a development some independent lupus experts described as a “major breakthrough” that could lay the groundwork for a potential cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/07/24/stanford-ucsf-launch-cancer-research-and-care-collaboration/"&gt;Stanford, UCSF launch cancer research and care collaboration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ady0210"&gt;In a paper&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal Science Translational Medicine, the Stanford researchers said they have connected the dots between lupus and the Epstein-Barr virus, a virus 95% of Americans carry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study, that common virus infects certain white blood cells that are part of the immune system until, ultimately, more and more cells are recruited into a battle against the command centers of cells in one’s own body.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Betty Tsao, a prolific autoimmune disease researcher and professor of medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina, said other biological factors may complicate the race to cure lupus. But she described the Stanford research team’s paper as “a major breakthrough” and said the study is “convincing” in illustrating the biology behind lupus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an exciting time,” Tsao said. “And we hope we will have much better therapy options for patients in a very short horizon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Robinson, professor of immunology and rheumatology at the Stanford medical school, who is the study’s senior author, said the “breakthrough” reveals “the key missing link for how EBV causes lupus,” using the acronym for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery may reveal new possibilities for effective prevention and treatment. Currently, doctors offer lupus patients a wide range of medications with limited results and a slew of possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;By identifying the biological process that leads to lupus, Robinson said he and his colleagues can pursue treatment to interrupt the immune system’s misguided — and dangerous — attack against the body it is designed to protect. In particular, the co-authors plan to use a targeted sequencing technology to identify and remove the white blood cells infected with the Epstein-Barr virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would “effectively cure lupus,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s now the mission of EBVio Inc., a privately-held biotech company co-founded by Robinson and two of his Stanford colleagues. On Wednesday, Robinson said they did not have immediate plans to take the company public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to make a good drug,” Robinson said. “We’re still pretty early-stage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study landed as other scientists advance early research into &lt;a href="https://www.lupus.org/resources/car-t-cell-therapy-for-lupus"&gt;the application of a cancer treatment to lupus patients.&lt;/a&gt; In that approach, CAR T-cell therapy, white blood cells called B cells are removed en masse from the body. That could put lupus into remission, but at the cost of a weakened immune system, according to the Lupus Foundation of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bay Area and Northern California, the new research was greeted with gratitude and praise in the community of people living with lupus, or those supporting a family member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By tying lupus to the Epstein-Barr virus, the Stanford paper “represents a transformative moment for millions of people living with this devastating disease,” said Thomas Bakewell, executive director of the Lupus Foundation of Northern California. “This finding brings us closer than ever to understanding the ‘why’ behind lupus and, importantly, opens the door to new pathways for prevention and cure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility of a cure for lupus would “truly be amazing,” said Shauntay Davis-Patterson, 48. The Sacramento parent of two adopted boys knows all too well the journey of living with lupus, over the course of 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis-Patterson has contended with joint paint so severe that she couldn’t walk, hair loss, hospitalizations and bouts with chemotherapy. Lupus has attacked her kidneys so viciously that she’s waiting for a transplant. On top of that, she’s endured the “toxic” side effects of medication intended to help her. Prednisone, a steroid, improved her symptoms, but at the cost of osteoporosis, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We all kind of suffer in silence a lot because people don’t understand what we go through,” said Davis-Patterson, who runs a support group for lupus patients as part of the lupus foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford also developed osteoporosis, a brittleness and weakness in bones, because of Prednisone. And Plaquenil, which eases pain and swelling, can cause eye damage in patients who are older or have taken the drug for many years. Every six months, Ford has a doctor examine the health of her retinas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, big picture, both women consider themselves blessed. Davis-Patterson said she is grateful she can run after her boys, and that she was diagnosed quickly all those years ago. Some have to navigate the health system for years to nail down a diagnosis, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Ford is grateful that she’s as healthy as she is — even after two hip replacements. On Thursday, she laughed and brushed off talk of her symptoms and the pile of pills she has to take every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m really not that bad,” she said. “I think I’m one of the lucky ones, actually.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late 1990s, scientists and physicians increasingly reported a little-known health threat: peanut allergies. Estimates from the time suggest that only 0.4% of children had a peanut allergy. But the tide, it seemed, was changing — and changing fast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1988, Canadian doctors published what is likely the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/more-people-are-experiencing-severe-food-allergies-than-ever-before-108124"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1268069/"&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt; on the topic, recounting how a 24-year-old woman with a known nut allergy died moments after biting into a piece of cake topped with hazelnut icing. Hundreds more studies followed, documenting not only a rise in peanut allergies but an increasing number of people with allergies so severe that they resulted in death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans took notice. Newspapers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3700803/#R13"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; alarming stories: “Peanut Allergies Have Put Sufferers on Constant Alert,” read one 1995 Wall Street Journal headline; “Nut Allergy Girl’s Terror; Girl Almost Dies from Peanut Allergy,” reported the Daily Mirror.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that by 1997, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db121.htm"&gt;3.4%&lt;/a&gt; of children were allergic to at least one food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to these rising allergy rates, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has published &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/106/2/346/62820/Hypoallergenic-Infant-Formulas?token=2a7afc11-81ed-4ac4-9e02-bd0adfa7e1b8"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommending that parents avoid exposing infants to common food allergens until at least one year of age, and that nursing mothers also avoid consuming those foods. The guidelines’ authors acknowledged a lack of scientific evidence underlying their recommendations, including the push to delay introducing nuts until children were 3 years old. But the guidelines, they wrote, seemed “reasonable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, this guidance was “gospel” among pediatricians and parents, according to medical experts who spoke with Straight Arrow News. However, skeptical scientists later disproved these recommendations, prompting the AAP to retract its guidelines in 2008 and reverse them in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By then, an untold number of parents had withheld peanuts and other allergenic foods from their kids, increasing the risk of food allergies. Outside of its policy reversal, however, the AAP offered little public acknowledgment of how its earlier recommendations may have contributed to the rise in peanut allergies. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/opinion/medicine-allergies-research.html"&gt;debacle&lt;/a&gt; went down in the record as another misstep, fueling the public’s waning trust in science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-toll-of-food-allergies"&gt;The toll of food allergies&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) estimates that today&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/food-allergy#:~:text=NIAID%20is%20the%20lead%20institute,severe%20and%20life%2Dthreatening%20response."&gt;8%&lt;/a&gt; of children and 11% of adults — some &lt;a href="https://www.foodallergy.org/resources/facts-and-statistics"&gt;33 million&lt;/a&gt; Americans — have at least one food allergy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For some, a food allergy is a minor inconvenience; for others, it is a life-threatening condition. &lt;a href="https://www.jenniferprotudjer.ca/our-team.html"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Protudjer&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at the University of Manitoba, has spent years studying the effects of food allergies on individuals and communities. She and her team estimated that individuals with allergies and their families spend up to $1,700 more on allergy-friendly foods per year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recent study estimated that food allergies cost &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/13696998.2025.2563462?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed#d1e347"&gt;$22,234&lt;/a&gt; per patient per year, totaling $370 billion annually, when considering direct medical costs, household out-of-pocket expenses for specialty foods and broader societal costs such as lost work or reduced household productivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another study found that the odds of being food insecure were 39% greater among families whose kids have food allergies, compared to those without them, Protudjer told Straight Arrow News.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with food allergies and their caregivers even have a poorer quality of life, studies have found, and may suffer from food allergy anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We think that burden stems from the persistent threat of exposure to a food to which children might be allergic, but it also stems from the fact that the management of food allergy typically requires avoidance of the food in most or all forms,” Protudjer said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-guideline-reversal-nbsp"&gt;Guideline reversal &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the AAP released its guidelines, the number of children with a peanut allergy continued to rise; rates more than &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2010/rate-of-childhood-peanut-allergies-more-than-tripled-between-1997-and-2008"&gt;tripled&lt;/a&gt; from 1997 to 2008. In January of that year, the AAP &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/121/1/183/71045?autologincheck=redirected&amp;amp;utm_source=TrendMD&amp;amp;utm_medium=TrendMD&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Pediatrics_TrendMD_0"&gt;revised&lt;/a&gt; its position, noting that current evidence did not support withholding allergenic foods from infants or nursing moms. But the new guidance stopped short of instructing parents to feed their infants these foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-02.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-520101" srcset="https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-02.jpg 1920w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-02.jpg?resize=300,106 300w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-02.jpg?resize=768,272 768w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-02.jpg?resize=1024,363 1024w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-02.jpg?resize=1536,544 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later in 2008, British researchers published a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19000582/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that found the prevalence of peanut allergies among Israeli children — who commonly ate products containing peanuts from a young age — was 0.17% while the rate among U.K. children was 1.85%. The study led by &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/gideon-lack"&gt;Gideon Lack&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at King’s College London, presented landmark evidence debunking the guidance to avoid peanuts and other allergens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Lack led another critical study in which researchers randomly assigned 640 infants to either avoid or consume peanuts for the first five years of life. Researchers selected infants who either had egg allergy, severe eczema or both — conditions that predisposed the babies to develop a peanut allergy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the end of the study, 13.7% of the children who avoided peanuts developed a peanut allergy, compared with 1.9% of children who ate peanuts. Researchers concluded that introducing infants to peanuts and other allergenic foods prevented allergies, contradicting the AAP’s earliest guidance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2017, NIAID formally published new &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5226648/"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; instructing parents to introduce peanut-containing foods around six months of age. For higher-risk infants, such as those with eczema or egg allergy, parents were instructed to introduce foods containing peanuts even earlier, starting at four months. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The number of children who developed food allergies dropped sharply, from 1.46% of children studied before the new guidelines to 0.93% after, a recent &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/156/5/e2024070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found. That translates to almost 60,000 fewer children developing a food allergy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-520100" srcset="https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg 1920w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?resize=1024,576 1024w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?resize=128,72 128w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?resize=288,162 288w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?resize=480,270 480w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rate of kids developing a peanut allergy, specifically, fell by 46%. The shift was so significant that eggs overtook peanuts as the most common allergen among children. The study contributed to a growing body of evidence suggesting that withholding certain foods from infants may spur, rather than prevent, food allergies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lack-of-accountability-and-erosion-of-public-trust"&gt;Lack of accountability and erosion of public trust&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trust in science is waning. Fewer than 60% of Americans believe science has a mostly positive effect on society, and only 73% are confident that scientists act in the public’s best interests, according to a Pew Research Center &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/11/14/americans-trust-in-scientists-positive-views-of-science-continue-to-decline/"&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12478942/#:~:text=Overall%20change%20in%20trust%20in,(Cohen's%20d%20=%200.02)."&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic as a major inflection point. However, the reversal of earlier guidance on peanut allergies has also highlighted how shifting advice and a lack of accountability can erode public trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some have criticized the AAP for releasing guidelines based on “consensus statements and groupthink rather than evidence‐based medicine,” as one medical ethics researcher &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11976139/#apa70022-bib-0001"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hindsight is always 20-20, and I agree a lot of times we make guidelines based on very little data. And that’s what happened in 2000,” Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=17229"&gt;Ruchi Gupta&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pediatrics and the director of the Center for Food Allergy &amp;amp; Asthma Research at Northwestern University, told Straight Arrow News. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think there was just a lot of fear, because we started getting these headlines in the news of people dying from peanut exposure. And so, you know, I hate to blame anyone, but we really just didn’t know,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gupta stressed that the guidelines were developed at a time of uncertainty and had no malicious intent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Everybody’s doing their best. I don’t think anyone’s trying to put something out there that, you know, may not be correct or may do harm,” she said. “And that’s our first thing: Do no harm. So, like with the peanut thing, once we saw a rise, I think the instinct of every pediatrician is do no harm, protect our babies, you know. And so that was an easy way to potentially do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine major allergens — milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soybeans and sesame — &lt;mark class="has-inline-color"&gt;account for 90% of food allergies&lt;/mark&gt; in the U.S., according to the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Fact-Card-Food-Allergies.png" alt="" class="wp-image-520020" srcset="https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Fact-Card-Food-Allergies.png 720w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Fact-Card-Food-Allergies.png?resize=300,231 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2025/11/03/peanut-allergy-public-health-study"&gt;Others&lt;/a&gt;, including a representative from the AAP who spoke with Straight Arrow News, noted that those original guidelines were more of a sidenote embedded in a report about hypoallergenic infant formulas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There wasn’t really a huge focus on peanuts, but there was a comment in the report that, based on some hypothesis-generating types of data from what was available at the time, that for kids with high-risk developing food allergy, that they might benefit from delayed introduction,” Dr. Drew Bird, chair of the AAP’s’ Section on Allergy and Immunology, told Straight Arrow News.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know that I necessarily call that a huge endorsement by the AAP to change the way kids are fed. But regardless, that is how it evolved. It seems that that became a bit of the gospel that was communicated to pediatricians or that was interpreted. And over time, it became kind of widespread that parents should delay introduction of allergenic solids, including peanuts, until they were older,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors of the original guidelines do head off their recommendations with the following statement: “Conclusive studies are not yet available to permit definitive recommendations. However, the following recommendations seem reasonable at this time…” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Anthony Fauci, who served as the director of NIAID from 1984 to 2022, characterized the AAP’s guidelines as a “wrong call.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t make the recommendation,” Fauci &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DQChRMVjkwQ/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; CBS in 2019. “I wouldn’t say it was an error. I think what it was, it was a judgment call, that in the retrospect was the wrong call.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gupta pointed out that the AAP still maintains current recommendations around infant feeding that are not supported by scientific evidence. She pointed to &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/patiented/article-abstract/doi/10.1542/ppe_schmitt_222/82460/Solid-Foods-for-Infants-Baby-Foods?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; that instructs parents to introduce infants to foods &lt;a href="https://www.luriechildrens.org/en/news-stories/experts-question-need-to-wait-days-between-introducing-new-solid-foods-to-infants/"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; at a time every three to five days.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;“Why are we saying that when there’s still no data around that?” she asked. “You’re reducing the diversity in their diet at that really critical age, that early age where their immune systems are developing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gupta and her colleagues are working to change these guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think a lot of our guidelines make no sense, you know, and don’t have any data behind it,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-do-we-know-now-about-the-causes-of-food-allergies"&gt;What do we know now about the causes of food allergies?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists still do not fully understand food allergies or their risk factors. Some studies have linked the higher risks of food allergies to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36733768/"&gt;C-section&lt;/a&gt; deliveries and increased &lt;a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(19)31037-1/fulltext"&gt;antibiotic use&lt;/a&gt; during early childhood. Other scientists have found that breastfeeding may lower infants’ risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many aspects of modern life likely factor in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s the sun exposure we are not getting, it’s the foods we are not eating and the foods we are eating, it’s the chemicals we are exposed to, it’s the pollutants in our air, it’s the stress in our lives,” said &lt;a href="https://www.luriechildrens.org/en/doctors/waheeda-samady-3250/"&gt;Waheeda Samady&lt;/a&gt;, a physician, professor and the codirector of clinical research at Northwestern University’s Center for Food Allergy and Asthma Research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is all of it combined that is probably causing our bodies to be dysregulated and cause these allergic processes,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while introducing infants to allergenic foods as soon as they are able to eat solids has been shown to reduce overall rates of food allergy, it does not guarantee prevention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists are starting to gain some clarity around how food allergies develop. One leading theory centers around how infants are first exposed to a potential allergen. Infants who are first exposed through their skin — for instance, a mother eats peanuts before touching her infant and some peanut oil residue transfers onto the baby’s skin — are more likely to develop an allergy than those who are exposed through ingesting peanut butter, Samady said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When an infant is first introduced to an allergen through their gut, they build tolerance rather than develop an allergy, Samady explained. This may be why feeding infants foods as early as possible is key: It allows exposure through their gut rather than their skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-should-parents-handle-allergens"&gt;How should parents handle allergens?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the average child, Samady instructs parents to start feeding their infant as soon as they are ready to eat, meaning they can sit up, hold their head up, and show an interest in food. Once an infant is ready to eat, parents should offer them a variety of foods as long as they are safe and do not present a choking hazard.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you’re concerned about food allergies, then all the more reason to give them and to give them often. Don’t avoid any food, certainly not peanut butter, egg and milk. There’s now evidence that all three of those foods, if given early, you can avoid food allergies,” she told Straight Arrow News.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists also recommend giving allergenic foods more often.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You want to avoid what I call the ‘one and done,’ which is like, ‘We gave him peanut butter at 5-and-a-half months. He really liked it. It was good, and then we never gave it again,’” Samady said. “That is not enough to prevent food allergies.”&lt;/p&gt;

Yet the potato itself, before it is drowned in oil or salt, is far more nutritious than many realise. Researchers have been taking a closer look at what this simple root actually offers, and the findings are surprisingly positive. A peer-reviewed study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38763265/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; followed thousands of adults over time and found that people who ate more potatoes had a slightly lower risk of cardiovascular disease and early death. It suggests that the humble potato, when cooked sensibly, might play a small but helpful role in long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;keyword id="24704376" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="health-benefits-of-potatoes" source="keywords"&gt;health benefits of potatoes&lt;/keyword&gt; for long-term heart protection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people associate heart-healthy foods with obvious choices like leafy greens, berries and oats. Potatoes rarely appear on that list, yet they contain nutrients that directly support cardiovascular function. They are naturally high in potassium, a mineral that helps regulate blood pressure by counteracting the effects of sodium. Their fibre content also contributes to smoother digestion and better cholesterol control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Researchers who examined dietary data noticed that people who regularly ate potatoes in cooked, non-fried forms often had slightly healthier heart profiles. This does not make potatoes a miracle cure, but it shows that they can fit comfortably into a heart-healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;What Your Cholesterol Report Is Hiding — The Truth That Could Save Your Heart | Dr Vinayak Agarwal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the health benefits of potatoes come from their nutrient-rich profile&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potatoes contain &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/vitamin-c" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, vitamin B6, magnesium, antioxidants and resistant starch. Each of these plays a different part in keeping the body functioning smoothly. Vitamin C helps protect cells from oxidative stress. B6 contributes to nervous system health and supports metabolism. Resistant starch, which forms when potatoes cool down after cooking, behaves like a prebiotic. It feeds beneficial gut bacteria and improves overall gut balance, which researchers increasingly connect to immune strength, reduced inflammation and chronic disease prevention. When you stop viewing potatoes as empty carbs and start seeing their full nutritional picture, they become far more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What research says about the health benefits of potatoes for cancer prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some early studies suggest that potato compounds, particularly antioxidants like chlorogenic acid and certain plant chemicals found in coloured potato varieties, may help reduce cellular damage linked with cancer. However, most of these findings come from laboratory research rather than large human studies. Scientists are cautious about drawing strong conclusions, but they agree that including antioxidant-rich foods in the diet supports long-term cell protection. Potatoes can contribute to that mix, especially when eaten alongside vegetables, legumes and whole grains. The important message is balance. Potatoes can play a supportive role, but they should not be seen as a standalone defence against disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why preparation affects the health benefits of potatoes more than people realise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the negative assumptions about potatoes come from how they are prepared rather than the potato itself. Frying them in oil, covering them in cheese or pairing them with heavy, salty toppings alters their nutritional value dramatically. Steaming, baking, boiling or roasting with minimal oil keeps their natural nutrients intact. Leaving the skin on boosts fibre and mineral content. Even something as simple as letting cooked potatoes cool before eating increases resistant starch levels. The cooking method determines whether potatoes support health or work against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the health benefits of potatoes support blood sugar balance and weight control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often worry that potatoes raise blood sugar too quickly, but the body’s response depends heavily on how they are cooked, the portion size and what they are eaten with. When paired with protein, vegetables or healthy fats, the rise in blood sugar is steadier and more controlled. Fibre and resistant starch slow digestion and improve fullness, which can support healthier eating patterns and weight balance. These effects contribute indirectly to better heart and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Simple ways to maximise the health benefits of potatoes in everyday meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small changes can make potatoes a healthier part of daily meals. Choose baked, roasted or boiled potatoes instead of fried ones. Enjoy them with herbs, olive oil, lemon or yoghurt instead of heavy cream or butter. Pair them with vegetables and lean proteins for balanced meals. Cold potato salads made with light dressings provide extra resistant starch. Eating the skin, when washed properly, ensures you get more fibre, potassium and antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potatoes will never replace leafy greens or pulses, but they do not need to. Their strength lies in being accessible, versatile and surprisingly nutrient-dense. Current research shows encouraging links between potato consumption and heart health, and early evidence suggests there may also be benefits for cancer prevention. Prepared sensibly, potatoes can be a valuable part of a balanced diet. The next time you add potatoes to your plate, remember they are far more than just a side dish. They can actively support your long-term wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

		&lt;p&gt;A strain of the influenza virus that’s not a precise match for the vaccine has been spreading in the U.K., Canada and Japan, among other countries, and could sicken many in the U.S. this flu season.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The flu is on our doorstep, and &lt;a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2025/02/19/weekly-influenza-cases-nearly-double-in-maine-in-last-three-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;soon it will be knocking on our door,&lt;/a&gt;” said Dr. Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer for MaineHealth. “It may be a more severe season than normal.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mills said H3N2 tends to be a more potent strain, especially in older adults, which can result in more hospitalizations and illness in long-term care facilities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maine reported 17,793 flu cases during the 2024-25 flu season, which runs from October through May, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. So far this year, Maine has recorded 90 cases of influenza.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists each February predict what the predominant circulating strains will be for the following influenza season. Because it takes time to manufacture and distribute the vaccines, sometimes the predictions are not exact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Every once in a while we see a shift in the virus that makes the vaccine not a great match,” said Anna Krueger, a Maine CDC epidemiologist. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the message from public health officials hasn’t varied: Get your flu shot, if you haven’t already.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dominant circulating strain in the Northern Hemisphere is Influenza A H3N2, according to the World Health Organization. Small variations in the H3N2 strain – called subclades – took scientists by surprise when they &lt;a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2025/01/08/flu-surging-in-maine-covid-19-prevalence-also-very-high/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;emerged at the end of the flu season&lt;/a&gt; in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean the flu vaccine doesn’t work at all. It will still offer protection, especially from severe illness, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, Krueger said, other strains of the flu virus, such as Influenza A, H1N1 or Influenza B, may become the predominant strain at any time during flu season.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “It’s too early to tell if any one strain will dominate,” Krueger said. “There’s no typical flu season, but many times we will see Influenza A in the early season, and Influenza B later.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flu cases caused by H3N2 have tripled in the U.K., according to news reports.&lt;/p&gt;


	
	


&lt;p&gt;“Since it’s emerged, (H3N2) is rapidly spreading and predominating in some countries so far in the northern hemisphere,” Dr. Wenqing Zhang, head of the World Health Organization’s Global Respiratory Threats Unit, said Wednesday during a media briefing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Krueger said people can get the flu shot and the updated &lt;a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2025/09/25/fall-covid-19-shots-available-in-maine-for-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt; during the same appointment. Both vaccines are widely available at doctor’s offices and pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to getting vaccinated, to avoid flu, “stay home when sick and practice good hand hygiene.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccinations are available to protect against RSV, another seasonal respiratory illness. RSV vaccines are available for those 50 and older, and those who are between 32 to 36 weeks pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;

                Cognitive function tends to get worse as we age. But both mental and physical exercise can help fight that decline.

   &lt;p&gt;Scientists have found the first compelling evidence that cognitive training can boost levels of a brain chemical that typically declines as people age. The results of this 10-week study back earlier animal research showing that environments that stimulate the brain can increase levels of certain neurotransmitters. And other studies of people have suggested that cognitive training can improve thinking and memory. So how does it all work? And by &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; does it all work? Here to break everything down and help you understand how to keep your brain sharp is NPR science correspondent &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/people/2100615/jon-hamilton" target="_blank"&gt;Jon Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, that’s right. Getting a good night’s sleep is about more than just a comfortable mattress and the right temperature. Everything that leads up to the last few hours before bed really matters, especially what you consume. In a video shared on Instagram, Dr Manan Vora, a leading orthopaedic surgeon and sports doctor, talks about some foods and beverages that one should avoid before going to bed. What are they? Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Desserts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saving some room for dessert during dinner is not a good idea. That post-dinner ice cream or chocolate treat may give you a momentary dopamine hit, but it will be followed by dark circles and brain fog the next day. Though eating desserts, especially ice cream after dinner, is quite normalised, it is not good for sleep. “As tempting as it may be, the sugar and fat content in ice cream can delay digestion and disturb your sleep cycle,” Dr Vora said. The high sugar content will cause blood sugar spikes, and the fat content will significantly slow down digestion. It’s a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Caffeinated drinks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sipping some coffee or tea in the evening may feel relaxing, but it is going to kill your sleep. “Caffeinated drinks like tea and coffee contain caffeine, a stimulant that can keep you awake by increasing brain activity and interfering with your ability to fall asleep,” the doctor said. The caffeine will interfere with your plan to wind down. A recent study by the University of Texas found that nighttime caffeine consumption can &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)01458-0" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;increase impulsive behaviour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, potentially leading to reckless actions. This could absolutely explain your urge to buy all the items in your online shopping cart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who struggle with sleep, it is best to avoid caffeine at least four to six hours before bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fried food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep-fried food, in general, is not your health’s ally. If at all you are giving in to your cravings, try to avoid eating fried food in the hours leading up to your bedtime. Why? “Fried foods are high in fat and can be difficult to digest, leading to discomfort and potentially disrupting your sleep. Additionally, fried foods may cause heartburn or indigestion, making it challenging to sleep peacefully,” Dr Vora said. So, it may be better to save your broasted chicken or crispy fried dreams for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Excessive water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may come as a surprise, but sometimes even water may work against your sweet dreams. Wait, what? You aren’t supposed to drink water at night? Well, you can consume water, but not in excess. “Surprisingly, consuming large amounts of water before bed can disrupt sleep with multiple trips to the toilet. Try limiting your fluid intake a few hours before bedtime,” the doctor said. Drinking too much &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/nutrition/drinking-water-before-bed" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;water before bed contributes to nocturia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a condition of waking up several times a night to urinate, according to the Sleep Foundation. This will be especially prominent for people with certain conditions, such as kidney disease or diabetes, or those who are taking diuretic medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Alcohol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people believe a nightcap helps them sleep better. But guess what? It’s a misconception. Alcohol does not benefit your body in any way, let alone provide you with restful sleep. “Alcoholic beverages act as diuretics, increasing urine production and leading to frequent trips to the bathroom throughout the night, which can disrupt your sleep,” Dr Vora said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the next time you are planning your dinner, keep these in mind. Because sometimes even the things we assume harmless, in this case, excessive water can really keep you awake all night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

Better yet, it costs pennies and doesn't require a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm both an &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K5st0T8AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;adjunct assistant professor of medicine&lt;/a&gt; and a practicing physician. As a family doctor, I see the common cold every day. My patients are usually skeptical when I first recommend nasal saline irrigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they frequently return to tell me that this practice has changed their life. Not only does it help with upper respiratory  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="181652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;, but it also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2500/ajra.2012.26.3787"&gt;helps manage allergies&lt;/a&gt;, chronic congestion, postnasal drip, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.21053/ceo.2021.00654"&gt;recurrent sinus infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is nasal saline irrigation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasal saline irrigation is a process by which the nasal cavity is bathed in a saltwater solution. In some studies, this is accomplished using a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00140-1"&gt;pump-action spray bottle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In others, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.14.05044"&gt;participants used&lt;/a&gt; a traditional &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/multimedia/neti-pot/img-20008137"&gt;neti pot&lt;/a&gt;, which is a vessel resembling a teapot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181747" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181747" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/covid_virus_neti_pot_642.jpg" alt="neti pot" class="size-full wp-image-181747" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/covid_virus_neti_pot_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/covid_virus_neti_pot_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181747" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ceramic neti pot.

It garnered mainstream interest in the US in 2012 after Dr. Oz &lt;a href="https://www.oprah.com/health/your-questions-answered/5"&gt;demonstrated it on the "Oprah Winfrey Show&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's not the only device that has historically been employed for such purposes. Ancient Greek and Roman physicians &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S002221512100030X"&gt;had their own nasal lavage devices&lt;/a&gt;. Such practices were even &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(01)83808-3"&gt;discussed in medical journals&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; over a century ago, in 1902.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does nasal saline irrigation work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasal saline has a few key benefits. First, it physically flushes debris out of the nasal passage. This not only includes mucus and crust, but also the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="181652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; itself, along with allergens and other environmental contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, salt water is slightly lower on the &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/ph-scale-0"&gt;pH scale&lt;/a&gt; compared with fresh water. Its acidity creates an environment that is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2640010/"&gt;inhospitable for viruses&lt;/a&gt; and makes it harder for them to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, nasal saline helps restore the actions of part of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2500/ajra.2012.26.3787"&gt;our natural defense system&lt;/a&gt;, which is composed of microscopic, hairlike projections called &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/cilium"&gt;cilia&lt;/a&gt; that line the surface of the nasal passage. These cilia beat in a coordinated fashion to act like an escalator, propelling viruses and other foreign particles out of the body. Nasal saline irrigation helps keep this system running effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the research shows&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of more than 11,000 people published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; in 2024 demonstrated that nasal saline irrigation, initiated at the first sign of symptoms and performed up to six times per day, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00140-1"&gt;reduced the duration of symptomatic illness&lt;/a&gt; by approximately two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, smaller studies have reported that the reduced duration of illness could be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-024-08518-y"&gt;as high as four days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has also demonstrated that nasal saline irrigation can help prevent the spread of illness. A study in hospitalized patients showed that after detection of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="181652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; via nasal swab, nasal saline irrigation performed every four hours over a 16-hour period &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-024-08518-y"&gt;decreased COVID-19 viral load by 8.9%&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the viral load in the control group continued to increase during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181710" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181710" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/covid_virus_nasal_irrigation_642.jpg" alt="covid virus" class="size-full wp-image-181710" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/covid_virus_nasal_irrigation_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/covid_virus_nasal_irrigation_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181710" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nasal saline irrigation can decrease COVID-19 viral load. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAD6DPSwa6k/"&gt;mapo/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of nasal saline also extend beyond acute infectious illnesses. When performed regularly by patients with &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever"&gt;allergic rhinitis&lt;/a&gt;, also known as hay fever, a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="181652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 10 randomized controlled trials showed that nasal saline irrigation can enable a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2500/ajra.2012.26.3787"&gt;62% reduction in the use of allergy medications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also effective for chronic congestion, postnasal drip, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.21053/ceo.2021.00654"&gt;recurrent sinus infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides helping patients feel better faster, one of the most valuable benefits of nasal saline irrigation is that its use can help &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00140-1"&gt;decrease unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions&lt;/a&gt;, which are a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cis509"&gt;major contributor to antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is well established that antibiotics &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-024-08758-y"&gt;do not shorten the duration or reduce the severity&lt;/a&gt; of respiratory tract infections. Despite this, studies have shown that patients are happier when they leave their doctor's office &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1553-2712.2009.00522.x"&gt;with an antibiotic prescription in hand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be why &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2011-1337"&gt;10 million inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions&lt;/a&gt; are given each year for viral respiratory tract infections. In one study of more than 49,000 patient encounters for respiratory infections, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofac302"&gt;antibiotics were unnecessarily prescribed&lt;/a&gt; to 42.4% of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason patients with upper respiratory viral infections tend to initially feel better with antibiotics is because of their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2801304/"&gt;off-target, anti-inflammatory properties&lt;/a&gt;. However, this benefit &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/prp2.925"&gt;can be better achieved with anti-inflammatory medications&lt;/a&gt; such as ibuprofen or naproxen, which can be taken in conjunction with nasal saline irrigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, nasal saline irrigation is a cheap, effective, evidence-based alternative that will not only shorten the duration of illness but also prevent its spread, minimize the need for unnecessary antibiotics, and keep people out of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who want to try it, you don't need anything fancy. Even a neti pot is not necessary. Many pharmacies sell salt water in a container with a nozzle and even spray bottles that can be refilled with a homemade saltwater solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll mix approximately half a teaspoon of non-iodized salt with 1 cup of water. It's important for your safety that the water be either distilled water or boiled for at least five minutes and then cooled to destroy any harmful bacteria. You can also add a pinch of baking soda to reduce any potential sting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that saltier solutions are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.14.05044"&gt;not more effective&lt;/a&gt;. However, some studies have suggested that natural seawater, due to its additional minerals such as magnesium, potassium, and calcium, could &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anorl.2015.08.001"&gt;offer even greater benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saltwater solutions can also be purchased commercially, which might be worth a try for those with an insufficient response to saline alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use nasal saline irrigation after any potential exposure to an infectious illness. For best results, you'll want to start irrigating the nasal passage at the first sign of an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can repeat rinses throughout the day as often as needed for the duration of the illness. At a minimum, you'll want to irrigate the nasal passages every morning and evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also consider gargling salt water as an adjunctive therapy.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266659/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

The World Health Organization (WHO) requested these reviews to help shape upcoming recommendations on using these medications for obesity treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analyses evaluated three GLP-1 receptor agonists used for weight management and found that each one produced clinically important weight loss when compared with placebo. Even so, there is still limited or uncertain evidence about their long-term safety, possible side effects, and how financial ties might influence study results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists were first introduced in the mid-2000s to help people with type 2 diabetes. In that setting, particularly among those with underlying heart or kidney disease, the drugs helped improve blood sugar levels, lowered the risk of related complications, aided weight reduction, and reduced the likelihood of early death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, researchers have been testing GLP-1 receptor agonists in people with obesity. These medications work by imitating a natural hormone that slows digestion and helps individuals feel full for longer. In the United Kingdom, they are approved for weight management when combined with a reduced calorie diet and physical activity for people with obesity or for those who are overweight with related health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GLP-1 drugs show promise for weight management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the reviewed studies, tirzepatide, semaglutide, and liraglutide consistently led to significant weight loss over one to two years compared with placebo, and the benefits appeared to continue during ongoing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Tirzepatide (administered once weekly) produced about a 16% reduction in body weight after 12 to 18 months. Results from 8 randomized controlled trials (6 361 participants) indicated that these effects might last up to 3.5 years, although long-term safety data remain limited.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Semaglutide (also injected weekly) was associated with an average weight loss of around 11% after 24 to 68 weeks, with evidence suggesting the effect can persist for up to two years, based on 18 randomized controlled trials (27 949 participants). More people achieved at least a 5% weight reduction, but the drug caused higher rates of mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal issues.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Liraglutide (a daily injection) resulted in an average 4-5% weight loss in 24 trials (9 937 participants), still outperforming placebo. Evidence on benefits beyond two years was more limited.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reviews found little to no difference between the drugs and placebo when looking at major cardiovascular events, mortality, or quality of life. However, nausea and digestive discomfort appeared more often among people taking GLP-1 drugs, and some participants discontinued treatment because of these side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These drugs have the potential to bring about substantial weight loss, particularly in the first year," says Juan Franco, co-lead researcher from Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Germany. "It's an exciting moment after decades of unsuccessful attempts to find effective treatments for people living with obesity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent research and equitable access are key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the studies included in the reviews were funded by the companies that manufacture the drugs and were shaped by those companies in terms of design, analysis, and reporting. This has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest and highlights the importance of independent research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors also stressed that the use of these medications should be viewed in a broader health context, including issues such as access, affordability, and insurance coverage, so that existing health inequities are not made worse. Costs remain a major barrier, particularly for semaglutide and tirzepatide, while liraglutide has become more affordable since its patent expired. Semaglutide's patent is set to expire in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the trials were conducted in middle- and high-income countries, with little or no representation from regions such as Africa, Central America, and Southeast Asia. Because body composition, eating patterns, and health behaviors differ around the world, the authors emphasized the need to understand how these drugs work in more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We need more data on the long-term effects and other outcomes related to cardiovascular health, particularly in lower-risk individuals," says Eva Madrid, co-lead researcher from the Universidad de Valparaíso, Chile. "Weight regain after stopping treatment may affect the long-term sustainability of the observed benefits. More independent studies from a public health perspective are needed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reviews highlight the need for long-term, independent investigations to guide clinical and policy decisions and to better define the role of GLP-1 receptor agonists in lasting weight management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commissioned by the World Health Organization, the reviews will contribute to upcoming WHO guidelines on the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists for treating obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Some common, everyday habits gradually cause silent damage to your kidneys and increase your chances of developing chronic kidney disease. Nephrologist Dr. Arjun Sabharwal points out three daily mistakes people make that can lead to a gradual decrease in kidney function and affect their overall health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Taking painkillers every day&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people turn to over-the-counter painkillers to manage chronic aches and pains. Dr. Sabharwal says frequent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also referred to as NSAIDs, can decrease blood flow to the kidneys and cause long-term damage. So this kind of injury, analgesic nephropathy, develops silently. Most people do not notice symptoms until the damage has reached an advanced stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Don’t Ignore Silent Kidney Damage: How to Detect Issues Before It’s Too Late | Dr Sanjeev Bagai&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain relievers are usually safe if taken infrequently; however, overusing them without medical supervision is dangerous. Other treatment options include physical therapy or stretching exercises, or medications that have a lesser effect on the kidneys. People who may use painkillers often must be tested for kidney function frequently in order to catch early signs of stress or damage to the organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Use of unregulated herbal supplements&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people assume herbal remedies are safe, but Dr. Sabharwal says that some supplements contain heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, or arsenic. The kidneys can, over time, accumulate these toxins and suffer serious damage. In fact, studies reported in PubMed indicate that contaminated herbal products have been associated with acute and chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For renal protective purposes, herbal supplements should be selected from some proper and well-regulated sources. One can indicate all types of supplements to a healthcare provider. Avoid untested or unlicensed products and are wary of claims promising quick or miraculous results. Even natural products can have unintended consequences if they contain toxic substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ignoring high blood sugar&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic high blood sugar is a leading cause of kidney diseases. Continuous stress to the filtering units in the kidneys by elevated HbA1c levels can cause impairment in their blood and fluid balancing act. According to Dr. Sabharwal, prolonged, uncontrolled blood sugar greatly increases the risk for diabetic kidney disease. This risk is compounded by frequent use of painkillers or exposure to contaminated supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good blood sugar control is important for protecting the kidneys from damage. A healthy diet, regular physical activity, and following medications can help to keep blood sugar levels in control. Regular urine and blood tests are very important for early detection of kidney damage before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to protect your kidneys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kidney damage often occurs silently, with symptoms such as fatigue, swelling, bone pain, or changes in urination not appearing until significant damage is done. According to Dr. Sabharwal, it is advisable to protect kidney function proactively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key strategies include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting the long-term use of painkillers and finding safer alternatives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding unregulated herbal supplements that may carry heavy metals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management and control of blood sugar levels through lifestyle modifications and medication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection of developing renal impairment through regular monitoring of renal function. Being conscious of these habits would make it possible to minimize the danger of kidney disease and assist in long-term health.

If this is the case, it offers a hopeful target for future treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study shows a robust association between biomarkers indicative of thromboinflammatory activity and long COVID," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.70613"&gt;the team writes in a paper&lt;/a&gt; led by geneticist Alain Thierry of Montpellier University in France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The discovery of these biomarker linkages not only presents a possible novel diagnostic methodology but also novel therapeutic targets, offering prospects for future markedly improved clinical management."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-just-got-more-evidence-that-long-covid-is-a-brain-injury"&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Just Got More Evidence That Long COVID Is a Brain Injury&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason why some people experience symptoms for months to years after a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="181528" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;SARS-CoV-2&lt;/a&gt; infection is still &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-true-extent-of-long-covid-is-still-emerging-but-heres-what-we-know"&gt;something of a medical mystery&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/what-causes-long-covid-three-leading-theories"&gt;multiple mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; may be at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possibility first raised by physiologist Resia Pretorius of Stellenbosch University in South Africa &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12933-021-01359-7"&gt;in 2021 is microclots&lt;/a&gt;. These are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1042/BCJ20220016"&gt;tiny&lt;/a&gt;, abnormally persistent blood clots that are smaller than those seen in conditions such as stroke or thrombosis, yet large enough to hinder blood flow through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"&gt;capillaries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in 2022, Thierry and his colleagues showed that patients with long COVID have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.28209"&gt;elevated levels&lt;/a&gt; of neutrophil extracellular traps, or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_extracellular_traps"&gt;NETs&lt;/a&gt;. These are sticky webs of DNA and enzymes released by white blood cells to capture and contain pathogens invading the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, NETs do their job and then quickly break down, but when they are released in large numbers or persist longer than needed, they can contribute to blood flow problems &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/ATVBAHA.119.312463"&gt;such as thrombosis and atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research – a collaboration between Pretorius and Thierry – suggests that these two separate markers, NETs and microclots, may interact in the blood of long COVID patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181535" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/clot.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-181535" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/clot.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/clot-600x363.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181535" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A long COVID patient's microclot. The green areas are abnormal sticky proteins, while the red and blue parts are cellular material. (&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/1100665"&gt;Dr Chantelle Venter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used &lt;a href="https://eng.unimelb.edu.au/nanomaterials/capabilities/cytometry-and-particle-characterisation/imaging-flow-cytometry"&gt;imaging flow cytometry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_microscope"&gt;fluorescence microscopy&lt;/a&gt; to study blood samples from 50 patients with long COVID and 38 healthy volunteers, focusing specifically on any differences in microclots and NETs. The healthy individuals had been recruited in two separate cohorts, in France and South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with long COVID, the analysis revealed, had a dramatically higher number of microclots than the healthy controls – a 19.7-fold increase on the median. These clots were also larger than the microclots seen in healthy blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase in NETs also correlated with the rise in microclots in long COVID patients. But then the researchers found something new: The NETs appeared to be physically embedded within the microclots, an association that had never before been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interestingly, t&lt;/span&gt;his association was observed in all the samples, both from the long COVID patients and control groups, which makes sense because the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-81268-7"&gt;NETs' sticky mesh facilitates clotting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the effect was much more pronounced in the long COVID group. This interaction could make the microclots more resistant to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"&gt;fibrinolysis process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the body uses to break up accumulations of blood material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This finding suggests the existence of underlying physiological interactions between microclots and NETs that, when dysregulated, may become pathogenic," &lt;a href="https://www.su.ac.za/en/faculties/science/news/scientists-reveal-another-piece-long-covid-puzzle"&gt;Thierry explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So dramatic was the difference that, when the samples were anonymized, an AI agent was able to identify the long COVID patients with 91 percent accuracy. This suggests that microclots and NETs may be a biomarker that doctors could use to diagnose long COVID, a condition that has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/long-covid-is-likely-going-to-be-with-us-for-a-while-here-s-the-latest-theories"&gt;proven slippery&lt;/a&gt; to pin down &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/25111-long-covid"&gt;using standard tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is still early research; more work needs to be done to establish a causal relationship between microclots, NETs, and long COVID. But if researchers can figure out how these blood components affect long COVID, it may be a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-pain-treatment-may-offer-hope-for-long-covid-sufferers"&gt;step towards relief&lt;/a&gt; for those living with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.70613"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of Medical Virology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Mosquito-borne illnesses such as dengue fever are good examples, because they only proliferate in areas where the temperature and rainfall are beneficial for the mosquito population to grow, as well as for the disease itself to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, as the Earth heats up due to air pollution, more and more of the world fits those conditions — and dengue fever is already becoming a more widespread problem, as a new study covered by the Stanford Report &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/09/dengue-fever-rates-climate-change-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:revealed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study was conducted by researchers at Stanford, Harvard, Arizona State University, and the National Bureau of Economic Research. It was published in September in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers examined how much the Earth's rising temperature will increase cases of dengue fever in the future — and how much it already has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The effects of temperature were much larger than I expected," said lead author Marissa Childs, an assistant professor of environmental health at the University of Washington, per the &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/09/dengue-fever-rates-climate-change-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stanford Report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Stanford Report&lt;/a&gt;. "Even small shifts in temperature can have a big impact for dengue transmission, and we're already seeing the fingerprint of climate warming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So exactly how large was that fingerprint? After examining 1.4 million cases of the disease across 21 countries, researchers determined that climate change is responsible for an additional 4.6 million infections each year, representing an 18% increase in the disease's incidence. By 2050, the rate could climb another 49% to 76%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this result important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dengue fever, also called "breakbone fever," is a painful and potentially serious illness. In severe cases, it can cause debilitating pain and can lead to death. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, those who contract it more than once are at greater risk of experiencing a severe case. And as the world heats up, more and more people who have never been exposed to this illness before are now at risk — a fact which has already had a death toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This is not just hypothetical future change but a large amount of human suffering that has already happened because of warming-driven dengue transmission," &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/09/dengue-fever-rates-climate-change-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; senior author Erin Mordecai, a professor of biology from the Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences, per the Stanford Report. "Climate change is not just affecting the weather — it has cascading consequences for human health, including fueling disease transmission by mosquitoes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about dengue fever transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Recent research into vaccinations has yielded results that promise to reduce the spread of dengue fever worldwide. Some local governments are also working on directly controlling the mosquito population to thereby stop the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, the only long-term solution for the broader problem of diseases that spread more rapidly in warmer temperatures is to reduce the Earth's temperature by reducing air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/future-newsletter/?rec9bh39sND8fgERx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;good news&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;useful tips&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQUndCb3VRRFRaSl9UTW5OTWtwTndjRHN6RWVEbFpwbnlPcUF0ZGNiTjJLbnhLcTNGdnlJOVpCMy1CVGlKZzdGVFBmT201d3RLaTNkODNLaGpTcF9BSEY2NUJaSEU5ZmhvcnY2UjdJRGxrRzA4clhwWGUzQnA4d2FCM0k2QjFzNG5IdUJHeWJDZDdXdw</guid></item><item><title>我播出的“脑雾”时刻如何引发了一场大辩论- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpkenx9dzo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;How my on-air 'brain fog' moment sparked a big debate&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-0 fYJjWP"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-11 ljQVMv"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-5 xGeVU"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="sc-7bfdb3c2-7 djOqvY"&gt;Zoe Kleinman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-8 gvcwmG"&gt;Technology editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gtLOOD"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC BBC technology editor Zoe Kleinman holding notes as she speaks on the BBC News at Ten" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Due to "brain fog" BBC technology editor Zoe Kleinman had to hold notes during a recent live TV report&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;When I rather nervously shared a personal post about dealing with brain fog at work on the social network LinkedIn last week, I had no idea that it would have such an enormous impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It's been &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7393223331946332160/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;viewed&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of thousands of times.

But of course it can also hit mid-conversation, in a more intimate but no less frustrating way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;My post was about my decision to hold a page of notes on the BBC News at Ten. A story had broken late in the afternoon, following an already busy day, and by the time we reached 10pm, I knew I was getting tired and I could feel the brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;I was going to talk about an outage that was affecting dozens of websites and apps, and I planned to use the technical jargon for it, as given by the company affected, and then explain what it actually meant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But I just couldn't get the phrase to stick in my head and I knew that without it, I wouldn't manage the rest of what I needed to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;I was reporting live from Glasgow. Like many of my professional peers, I do not have, and I've never had, autocue. And so, for the first time, I decided at the last minute to hold a page of notes with the offending phrase on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It felt to me at the time like an admission of failure. I have been trained never to use notes – unless there's a specific legal reason why the wording of a statement, for example, has to be precise, or there are a lot of figures to remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Even then, I have prided myself on having a good enough short-term memory to get me through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Using notes is discouraged in the world of public speaking. They are not permitted to anyone giving a 12-minute TED talk. The speaker is expected to memorise their speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Looking down the barrel of the camera and clutching that paper, live on TV, felt tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But around 10% of women report &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/menopauseandtheworkplace" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;leaving their jobs&lt;/a&gt; due to menopause symptoms, according to the Fawcett Society. And research by insurance firm Royal London found that half of women going through it have &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.royallondon.com/about-us/media/Media-Centre/press-releases/press-releases-2023/october/Menopause-talent-drain-half-of-women-going-through-menopause-are-considering-leaving-work/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;considered giving up work.&lt;/a&gt; I don't want to do that – and so I stuck with my solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To my intense relief, some people said they thought my paper looked authoritative, that they just assumed it was a breaking story and the page contained fresh information. Others asked why I hadn't used a device instead – I suppose I thought the potential of having to fumble with a screen would feel even worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Let's start a movement: Hold your notes," wrote Elisheva Marcus, vice president of communications at the venture capitalist firm Earlybird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And so, the hashtag holdthenotes was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Have you ever checked your testosterone levels?" menopause expert Dr Louise Newson asked me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She says testosterone – despite its reputation for being a male hormone, and its association with sex drive and libido, is actually an essential brain chemical for both men and women, and levels fall in both genders. One of the results is brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It's like you've been drugged," she says. "It's really scary, a lot of people worry they've got dementia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I remember when I had my levels done 10 years ago, and I was like 'Thank God, at least I know why I'm feeling so awful'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She adds that there are studies dating back to the 1940s indicating that testosterone can improve brain function and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2499701-testosterone-helps-libido-in-menopause-can-it-treat-other-symptoms/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;wellbeing in women&lt;/a&gt; as well as men, but the randomised control studies, where participants are given either a placebo or the product itself in order to see whether it really works, have only focused on improvements to libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;NHS-prescribed &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Hormone Replacement Therapy,&lt;/a&gt; or HRT, is traditionally a combination of oestrogen and progesterone.

Dr. Love points out that alcohol alters how the brain communicates, altering learning, memory, and decision-making. Chronic heavy drinking can even shrink the brain tissue itself and distort neurotransmitter balance, impeding neurons from communicating as they should.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alcohol also disrupts sleep quality, even though it may get you to sleep quicker, and disrupted sleep amplifies the toxic effect on the brain. Chronic alcohol consumption raises the risk of neurodegenerative diseases and, in severe cases, can result in permanent cognitive impairment. According to Dr. Love, if you can cut down or practice mindful drinking, you can spare your brain from further damage. For people who struggle with alcohol addiction, professional intervention can be life-changing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-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</guid></item><item><title>好莱坞的“美丽”死亡让我恶心-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15234677/George-Clooney-movie-Alzheimers-suicide.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-18afc350-b40a-11f0-8257-97c609e9cb2c"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; dementia specialist has issued a stark warning that &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/george_clooney/index.html" id="mol-188557f0-b40a-11f0-8257-97c609e9cb2c"&gt;George Clooney&lt;/a&gt;'s new film could romanticize assisted suicide and send a dangerous message to millions of vulnerable people living with &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-7c4b55f0-b40a-11f0-8257-97c609e9cb2c"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patty Mouton, a veteran gerontologist and palliative care expert from Orange County, told the Daily Mail that Clooney's forthcoming movie In Love risks 'glamorizing' death and distorting the painful realities of illness, care, and family duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have a very, very serious responsibility not to glamorize the notion of going out standing tall instead of on my knees,' Mouton said. 'That's not life. Life is cyclic — it includes vulnerability. To avoid that is to limit our human experience.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clooney, 64, will star in In Love, based on Amy Bloom's bestselling 2022 memoir In Love: A Memoir of Love and Loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The story follows Bloom and her husband, architect Brian Ameche, who was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's and &lt;a target="_self" href="/home/books/article-10834741/A-week-architect-told-dementia-decided-end-life.html"&gt;chose to end his life at the Swiss assisted dying clinic Dignitas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the film, Clooney plays Ameche, with Annette Bening as Bloom. Filming begins in New England in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To many, it's a tender love story about autonomy and dignity. Bloom herself called the memoir a reflection on 'truth-telling and the right to face death without shame.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Director Paul Weitz has called the story a 'contemporary fable of love, wit, and existential stakes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-448725" data-gramm="false"&gt;Actors George Clooney and Annette Bening will star as the husband and wife couple grappling with an Alzheimer's diagnose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-146353" data-gramm="false"&gt;California gerontologist Patty Mouton says Clooney's forthcoming movie In Love risks 'glamorizing' death &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Mouton isn't convinced. She fears the film's Hollywood gloss and star power will mask the grim emotional and moral costs of assisted suicide — and make it seem like a graceful, noble exit rather than a desperate decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My hope is that the production team will be very, very careful not to emotionally incentivize people to think about assisted suicide in a more positive way,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not this convenient way to wrap up a life. It has far, far-reaching ramifications.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The longtime dementia care specialist worries that Clooney's portrayal could make those struggling with Alzheimer's — and their exhausted loved ones — believe that choosing death is an act of courage or love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What does it say about people who are not 100 percent strong — physically, emotionally, or cognitively?' she asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Is it telling them that their lives are no longer worthwhile, and that it's better to just end it before you become inconvenient or expensive?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drawing from decades at the bedsides of dying patients, Mouton said decisions like these are never made in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They're shaped by fear, exhaustion, family tension, and medical bills that average around $70,000 per year for dementia sufferers, straining even premier health insurance plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've had families say, 'Can't we end this sooner? It's so expensive,'' she revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sometimes the evidence suggests they don't want their inheritance to be diminished by a long, drawn-out caregiving experience.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that society must 'reaffirm its duty' to care for the sick with compassion, not convenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have a duty to help people understand they're going to be taken care of with love, respect, and dignity,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We must disabuse people of the notion that the only way to live is with complete strength and cognitive ability.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-482900" data-gramm="false"&gt;Clooney, pictured here with wife Amal, is one of Hollywood's most recognizable stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-540444" data-gramm="false"&gt;The movie depicts the real-life story of Amy Bloom and her husband Brian Ameche   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-839163" data-gramm="false"&gt;They travelled to Switzerland's notorious end of life clinic Dignitas, where Brian ended his life &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her comments come as Alzheimer's cases rise across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 7.2 million Americans currently live with the disease — a figure &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-5527593/5-7-million-people-Alzheimers-costing-277-BILLION-year.html"&gt;expected to double by 2050&lt;/a&gt; as the baby boomer generation ages, according to the Alzheimer's Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The degenerative brain disorder robs people of memory, reasoning, and independence. It remains incurable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while 12 US states and Washington, DC allow physician-assisted dying, it is reserved for terminally ill, mentally competent adults expected to die within six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;None permit it for dementia patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Connecticut — where Bloom and her husband lived — bans it altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's why the couple traveled to Switzerland, where Dignitas offers assisted death to foreigners who are &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12881125/More-530-desperate-Brits-ended-life-Dignitas-Swiss-clinic-opened-1990s-interactive-globe-reveals-nations-assisted-suicide-service-popular.html"&gt;acting voluntarily and have decision-making capacity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dementia is problematic, as sufferers have to make end-of-life decisions before their capacity to consent to an assisted suicide is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mouton said the growing normalization of procedures, from Europe to Hollywood, risks warping the public's moral compass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If we are going to be a civilized society,' she said, 'aren't we judged by the way we treat those who are most vulnerable?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mouton said she has never known anyone personally who went to Dignitas, but she has counseled countless families wracked with fear and guilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many, she said, underestimate the emotional toll — or the potential for healing — in caring for loved ones through decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-645778" data-gramm="false"&gt;Celebrated American writer Amy Bloom co-wrote the screenplay for the upcoming movie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-963192" data-gramm="false"&gt;Her 2022 book describes how Brian, in his own words, wanted to die 'standing tall, not on his knees' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also warned that those who choose to die early may miss out on medical breakthroughs or moments of grace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What if I'm the person who gets into a clinical trial and gets the magic bullet?' she asked. 'What if the next discovery comes six months later, and I've ended my life too soon?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When somebody has a diagnosis like dementia, we might miss the opportunity to help the medical community learn more — or even get to a cure,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Mouton, end-of-life care isn't just about dying — it's about living meaningfully, right to the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've seen siblings come together after not speaking for years,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've seen divorced couples reunite, so one can care for the other because it's the right thing to do. These are extraordinary expressions of love and healing — and we miss them if we just end it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She's witnessed patients who, even in their final days, still show small signs of wanting to live — accepting water, or a small bite of food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Death is inconvenient,' she said. 'We have to accept that.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mouton doesn't mince words about her opposition to assisted dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Suicide has detrimental effects on people,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can call it empowering, considerate, or intellectually superior. It's still suicide — and it still has really strong, difficult, often negative impacts on the loved ones of the person who's taken their life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She believes In Love — with its A-list cast and emotive storytelling — could unintentionally sell suicide as a moral act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mouton said she misses the days when films celebrated courage and endurance rather than convenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-666036" data-gramm="false"&gt;The nondescript room on the outskirts of Zurich, Switzerland, where Dignitas visitors end their lives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-401127" data-gramm="false"&gt;Doctor-assisted deaths are widely available in Canada, though heavily restricted in the US  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think it was better when we had more movies about courage — doing the right thing under terrible circumstances,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's life after a diagnosis of dementia. Sometimes people live 12 or 15 years, and they're not debilitated until the very end.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The danger,' she added, 'is that people won't understand that life isn't over just because you have a serious diagnosis. There's still love. There's still learning. There's still life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her warnings echo those of disability rights advocates, who have also sounded alarms about Hollywood's growing fascination with 'beautiful' deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ian McIntosh, executive director of the advocacy group Not Dead Yet, called In Love 'a disability snuff film by any other name.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Hollywood keeps depicting the everyday experiences of disabled people as a fate worse than death,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Million Dollar Baby and Me Before You were panned for glorifying suicide as rational, even noble. In Love will be no different.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, end-of-life choice advocates, such as Compassion &amp;amp; Choices, argue that controlled assisted dying offers autonomy and peace, not pressure, and that laws can include strict safeguards to prevent abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Advocates say films like In Love help open long-overdue conversations about dignity, autonomy, and patient rights at the end of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-214180" data-gramm="false"&gt;In Love is being made by Smokehouse Pictures, the production company co-founded by longtime friends Grant Heslov (left) and George Clooney (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Whether to allow assisted dying stirs strong feelings, including in the UK (pictured), where a law change is being debated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mouton said she doesn't question Clooney's intentions — only the potential consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She hopes he and his team remember that behind every Alzheimer's story is not just pain, but resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's easy to make a movie about despair,' she said. 'It's harder — and braver — to make one about endurance.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My message to anyone with dementia is simple,' she concluded. 'You are not a burden. You are loved. You still matter.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 22:38:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNQk5zWHp5SG1iRFFWOGwyM1k1ZDBvZFNUS1RYTjc3Ukt4SnY1OF9SekZiQlFodEJmMVFLYmhlUHBLQlBkWGkxMEJJWW80TjE5QWxRT05UWWFRRVRVcFJuRDFLYjZlOEhjZWxuYmJHSTZ3QXpRRUduLXR6Nm9pd0hfcWpWTVNsYmplMkNtMEVGZFNGcDFHWHo0UERn</guid></item><item><title>癌症，马铃薯能让心脏病远离吗？查看健康益处-《经济时报》</title><link>https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/us/cancer-heart-disease-can-be-kept-away-by-potato-check-health-benefits/articleshow/125373117.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-brcount="41" class="artText"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potatoes are a solid source of vitamin C.

But when they're prepared in a healthy way, potatoes are an "amazing, nutrient-dense" food, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potatoes are high in carbohydrates (a medium-size peeled russet potato has about 35 grams), but that doesn't make them "inherently bad," explained Tara Schmidt, a dietitian and instructor of nutrition at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota -- it just means they may not be considered an "unlimited" food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potatoes are complex carbs that take longer for the body to break down and digest than simple carbs, so they provide a steadier source of energy, which helps you feel fueled and fuller for longer, Kleiner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But certain varieties do have a high glycemic index, meaning they can rapidly spike blood sugar, Kleiner said. Diets rich in foods with a high GI have been linked to an increased risk of diabetes and heart disease. Waxy potatoes, like fingerlings and red potatoes, tend to have a lower GI than russet or Idaho potatoes, she explained, and boiled and roasted potatoes have a lower GI than fried or mashed ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help manage blood sugar spikes and slow digestion, Schmidt suggested "meal balancing" by pairing potatoes with lean protein, healthy fats and nonstarchy vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAQs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1.

                &lt;p&gt;In 1958, during the height of the Cold War, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed what was known as the National Aeronautics and Space Act into law. The goal of the legislation was to create an agency dedicated to civilian space exploration and aeronautics research, and from it NASA was formed. The agency been making &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/1984386/nasa-voyager-1-discovery-wall-of-fire/" target="_blank"&gt;stunning solar system discoveries&lt;/a&gt; for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its logo evokes imagery of rockets lifting toward space and astronauts spacewalking against starry backdrops. But NASA's research and development efforts have also produced technology we use on a daily basis. The demands of space exploration have tasked NASA with finding solutions to problems that don't necessarily exist anywhere else. Equipment must be lightweight but durable, compact but powerful, and capable of functioning reliably in extreme conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet when solving these problems, NASA engineers create technologies with applications right here on Earth. Devices that help us keep the house clean, tools that ensure the safety of our loved ones, and even our beloved selfie cameras all have NASA's fingerprints on them. NASA classics like freeze-dried ice cream may not currently grace your pantry shelves, but the American space program's influence can be found in plenty of devices elsewhere around the house. Let's explore some of the NASA inventions we use on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In order to collect lunar samples from the moon's surface, NASA realized during the Apollo missions of the 1960s and early 1970s that it would need to develop portable, battery-powered tools. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center partnered with Black &amp;amp; Decker to develop a specialized drill that could operate in zero gravity while maintaining the proper amount of power during an extended runtime. The company's engineers created a computer program capable of optimizing the motor's design, ensuring maximum power output with minimal drain on the drill's power source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drill that was developed would go on to lay the foundation for Black &amp;amp; Decker's consumer product lineup. In January of 1979 the company introduced the Dustbuster, the popular handheld vacuum that worked cordlessly to clean stairs, sofas, and hard-to-reach places. The success of the Dustbuster was due in large part to the convenience it provided while keeping the house clean, and over the years that concept has been taken to greater heights. Companies like Dyson and Shark are known for their more sophisticated, full-size cordless vacuums, and the influence of those NASA Apollo missions can even be seen in devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/tech/are-roomba-robot-vacuums-still-worth-it/" target="_blank"&gt;Roomba and other robot vacuum options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;While the smoke detector dates all the way back to 1890, it's a good example of a piece of technology NASA improved upon greatly for its own use. In the 1970s NASA partnered with Honeywell Corporation to develop an adjustable smoke detection system for Skylab, the first American space station. With astronauts unable to evacuate to safety in the event of a fire, NASA needed a device reliable enough to warn crews of smoke and toxic gases, yet sophisticated enough not to be triggered by the routine activities going on at Skylab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting NASA invention was an ionization smoke detector with adjustable sensitivity, which influenced the evolution of home detectors over the years that followed. Honeywell would go on to release a battery backup smoke detector with a self-recharging battery, which became one of the most sophisticated alarm systems available for residential use. To this day, many home smoke detectors use ionization technology similar to what NASA developed.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;When you're exploring the unknown, bringing back pictures is imperative, like &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/nasa-just-snapped-the-closest-photos-of-the-sun-ever-taken/" target="_blank"&gt;NASA's recent close-up photos of the sun&lt;/a&gt;. Early space cameras were large, power-hungry devices that took up a lot of room aboard NASA spacecraft. Photographic equipment would need to be implemented into satellites as well, and by the 1990s, NASA was set on improving image sensors for a new generation of space exploration. The culmination of that research was CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) technology developed by a NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key innovation within CMOS technology was the active-pixel sensor. It was capable of boosting image quality while requiring 100 times less power than the then-standard CCD sensor. While the CMOS sensor was immediately beneficial for NASA, it has become transformational for the rest of us, with far more than a billion cameras utilizing CMOS technology manufactured since. CMOS sensors can be found in everything from professional video cameras to vehicle backup cameras, and from the main camera of popular smartphones to the front-facing selfie camera that allows you to video chat with friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;While working on a water purification system for spacecraft at the Ames Research Center, NASA's Dr. Ted Wydeven inadvertently discovered the foundation for scratch-resistant plastic lenses. NASA expanded on the discovery to develop an abrasion-resistant coating for astronaut helmets and the plastic surfaces of other space equipment. Meanwhile, eyeglass manufacturers were making a switch to plastic lenses, and in 1983 a company called Foster-Grant obtained a license from NASA to combine its decade of scratch-resistance research with NASA's scratch-resistant coating technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting lenses lasted 10 times longer than standard plastic lenses and even surpassed glass in terms of durability. Today, scratch-resistance technology can be found in everything from ski goggles to sunglasses, and if tech like &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/1992030/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-repairability-ifixit-teardown/" target="_blank"&gt;Meta's expensive smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; ever become popular among the masses, it's likely we'll see scratch-resistance incorporated into them as well. What began as a NASA invention to protect astronauts and their equipment from the harshness of space now provides us with protection on our smartphone screens, camera lenses, and other optical equipment in addition to eyewear.&lt;/p&gt;

				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In order for astronauts to control spacecraft and equipment while wearing bulky spacesuits, NASA engineers developed joystick technology. Apollo spacecraft used a special joystick with buttons on the hilt. Known as the "picklestick," the joystick sent electrical signals to the Apollo Guidance Computer to give astronauts control of the spacecraft's trajectory. The technology evolved through NASA's programs, and the United States military uses the picklestick and a digital fly-by-wire system in many of its fighter aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to everyday use around the house, joysticks are probably most recognized in the gaming world. They were popularized in the early 1980s on home console controllers, and today joysticks are standard in video game controllers across platforms. Dual joystick controllers allow for the control of characters as well as in-game cameras, and devices like drones utilize joysticks for control as well. The joystick has even evolved into a digital existence, with many mobile games and apps using touch-based controls designed to emulate a joystick.&lt;/p&gt;
