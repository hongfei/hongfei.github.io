Symptoms include loud snoring and making gasping or choking noises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Thirty people living with the disorder and aged between 19 and 65 were involved in the trial, led by researchers at the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute in Jaipur, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/india" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;About half of the group were taught how to use the shell, while the others carried out deep breathing exercises. Both groups were encouraged to practise their techniques for at least 15 minutes, five days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Six months later, the trial found that those who had practiced shankh blowing were 34% less sleepy during the day. They also had higher blood oxygen levels during the night, and four to five fewer OSA episodes an hour on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Shankh blowing is a simple low-cost breathing technique that could help improve sleep and reduce symptoms without the need for machines or medication,” said Dr Krishna K Sharma, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The way the shankh is blown is quite distinctive. This action creates strong vibrations and airflow resistance, which likely strengthens the muscles of the upper airway, including the throat and soft palate, areas that often collapse during sleep in people with OSA.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The most common form of treatment for sleep apnoea is a continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap) machine, which involves patients wearing a mask that blows pressurised air into the nose and throat while asleep. Previous research has also found that playing a woodwind instrument could help with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Although the machines are effective, they can be uncomfortable, leading the researchers to suggest that shankh blowing could be a promising alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A larger trial involving several hospitals is being planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The findings of this trial are encouraging, but the small scale of the trial means it’s too soon to say for certain that conch blowing can help people manage their obstructive sleep apnoea,” said Dr Erika Kennington, the head of research and innovation at Asthma + Lung UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s also not clear from this research why blowing through a conch shell regularly might improve someone’s symptoms. It would be good to see the conch blowing approach tested on a larger scale and compared with other proven strategies, such as limiting alcohol, staying active and maintaining good bedtime habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“OSA is a long-term condition, but with the right treatments and lifestyle changes, people can make a real difference to their symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxOZER1T0txSEJvZXV2cWU3TWJ1SDdOMVNXMlNsTXN3TUlRalVaUy05SkJUYmxNS0VhZWJOMzFUQkM4YkJjWkVzR0RINUgwZkhqNnpqS2tJZXByWUEzQ1M1aDFGd0xYUjRMZ2RXVmhaY2xFMnpGMmhsUEtLQjhFUTg2Q3NzS19ncGVTUmNxOExHbnYxajBucXRVZFpvWGlqWHJ0MXZxLXBKOTJxTjU5anhUWHVhaw</guid></item><item><title>活到100岁的人与疾病有着独特的关系- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNRW1Ial9YcXJaSVF4SzFLaHE4QXI1eUJvbi1GNWRFUkstWjhMejNub1lBOEluUVEtQmstSUl6X1ZsOXZhQ2loR1l2NVVGRk1ncE5ZZm9jN3RET2VjRURTY2NxVmQyNGJ1U2c0MFBBVEUxaXZISjZqVDN4dTNYbjN5MVJzd1ZidWF6WEktY2JxT2E2RklNWlE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Humans may be &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy"&gt;living longer on average&lt;/a&gt; these days, but, even so, only a fraction of us will live to see our 100th birthday. Yet the reasons why only a select few will become centenarians still remains a mystery to scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the latest work published by myself and my colleagues has just uncovered one factor that may be key to the long lives that centenarians experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My research team has found that people that live to 100 seem to possess the superhuman ability to avoid disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-live-past-100-experts-recommend-these-four-habits"&gt;Want to Live Past 100? Experts Recommend These Four Habits.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centenarians are of such great interest to scientists because they may hold the key to understanding how we can live longer – and live longer in better health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some questions researchers have long pondered is whether one of the keys to a centenarian's resilience mainly lies in their ability to postpone major diseases, or whether they're simply better at surviving them. Or, could it be that they avoid certain diseases altogether?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the answer to these questions would bring us at least one step closer to figuring out what specific factors contribute to longevity. So my colleagues and I set out to see if we could find the answers. In two recent studies, we analysed and compared long and shorter-lived people born in the same year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results from the two studies showed that centenarians not only suffer from fewer diseases overall throughout their lives, they also develop them more slowly. They're also less likely to experience deadly conditions, such as major cardiovascular disease, compared to their shorter-lived peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-024-01330-w"&gt;The first study&lt;/a&gt; included 170,787 people born in Stockholm County, Sweden between 1912 and 1922. Using historical health data, residents were followed for 40 years – either from age 60 until their death, or up to age 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We calculated each participant's risks of stroke, heart attack, hip fracture and various cancers, and compared those who survived to the age of 100 with their shorter-lived counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that centenarians not only had lower rates of disease in late-midlife, but they continued to have lower rates of disease throughout their life overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, at the age of 85, only 4% of those who lived to be centenarians had experienced a stroke. In comparison, around 10% of those who almost became centenarians – living to ages 90–99 – had experienced a stroke by age 85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, despite living longer, their lifetime risk for most diseases never reached those of their shorter-lived peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the age of 100, 12.5% of centenarians had experienced a heart attack, compared to just over 24% among people who lived between the ages of 80 and 89. This suggests that centenarians delay – and in many cases even avoid – major age-related diseases, rather than simply surviving them more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One limitation of this study is that it only focused on analysing more serious diagnoses of major diseases. But what if the real key to longevity isn't that centenarians avoid disease entirely – rather, it's that they're able to avoid developing serious diseases?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, we conducted a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(25)00328-1/fulltext"&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt; that included 40 different medical conditions. These conditions ranged from mild to severe – such as hypertension, heart failure,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="170821" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We looked at 274,108 participants who were born between 1920 and 1922 and who lived in Sweden. We followed participants for around 30 years – either from the age of 70 until their death or until they turned 100. A total of 4,330 people became centenarians – just 1.5% of the participants we looked at for the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170828" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170828" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/heart_check_doctor_642.jpg" alt="doctor listening to man's heart" class="wp-image-170828 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/heart_check_doctor_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/heart_check_doctor_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/heart_check_doctor_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170828" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Centenarians were less likely to be diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGNJtG7NLs/"&gt;Gabriella Csapo/corelens/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after including a wider range of diseases and allowing participants to have more than one health condition in the analysis, our team came to the same conclusions as we did in the first study: centenarians developed fewer diseases – and their rate of disease accumulation was slower across their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found that centenarians were more likely to have conditions limited to a single organ system. This is a sign of this group's health and resilience, since diseases that affect one organ system are much easier to treat and manage in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, while cardiovascular conditions were the most common diagnoses across all age groups, centenarians were less likely overall to be diagnosed compared to their short-lived companions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the age of 80, around 8% of centenarians were diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. In comparison, more than 15% of people who died at the age of 85 had been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease by 80 years of age. The lower rates of cardiovascular disease appear to be central to the centenarians' extended survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centenarians also demonstrated greater resilience to neuropsychiatric conditions – such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="170821" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and dementia – throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170829" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170829" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/centenarian_flowers_642.jpg" alt="Centenarian with flowers" class="wp-image-170829 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/centenarian_flowers_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/centenarian_flowers_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/centenarian_flowers_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170829" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Resilience to neuropsychiatric conditions could be a secret to a longer life. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGNJtG7NLs/"&gt;EyeJoy/Getty Signature Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although most centenarians eventually developed multiple health conditions, they did so much later in life than non-centenarians – usually around the age of 89. This was thanks to having fewer diseases and a slower rate of disease accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, non-centenarians typically experienced a sharp increase in the number of health conditions they suffered with in the final years of their lives. But centenarians did not experience this same sharp decline in health – even from their 90s onward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The secret to a long life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding that centenarians manage to delay, and in some cases avoid, disease despite living longer is both intriguing and encouraging. It shows it's possible to age more slowly than is typical – and challenges the common belief that a longer life inevitably comes with more disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that exceptional longevity isn't just about postponing illness but reflects a distinct pattern of ageing. But whether this is mainly due to genetics, lifestyle, environment or a combination of these factors remains unknown. The next step in our research will be to explore what factors predict living to 100 – and how such predictors operate during a person's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the mechanisms behind healthy ageing in centenarians may offer valuable insights for promoting longer, healthier lives for all.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262645/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The findings represent a dramatic breakthrough in treatment options for OSA, with Dr Krishna K Sharma, of the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute in Jaipur, India, stating they serve as a 'promising alternative'. The team are now planning a larger trial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;US researchers, who &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14773399/Sleep-problem-10million-deadliest-cancer-lung-study-asco.html"&gt;assessed the health records of more than 2.4million adults&lt;/a&gt;, said they cannot be sure exactly why the common sleep disorder raises this risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they believe it may be due to the lack of oxygen people get during the night - or lifestyle factors including smoking and even obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Presenting the findings at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago, scientists urged policymakers to consider screening those with the condition for the disease and tackle sleep apnea early, soon after a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers at Marshall University in West Virginia, tracked lung cancer diagnoses separating those diagnosed with OSA and those without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After accounting for factors that could skew the results, such as age and other diagnosed health conditions, they found OSA patients were 1.21 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared to those without OSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sleep deprivation can lead to obesity, memory loss, diabetes, heart disease, heightened and unstable emotions, impaired ability to learn and a reduced immune response, leaving you vulnerable to disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jowan Al-Nusair, study co-author and physician at Marshall University told the Daily Mail it was 'one of the first statistically significant studies' to prove a link between the condition and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While further studies are definitely now needed to investigate just how the significant the link truly is, this suggests OSA may be a preventable risk factor for lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We should be more closely monitoring patients with OSA. Patients would definitely benefit from screening and early intervention to combat OSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Additional studies are essential to understand exactly why OSA may increase this risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 00:41:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOaHlJRFZ3VjZWNTJYZGpJNERQZmpzcWc2eExxN3Q2dzI3V253N0FGVlZtU05ZZ0gzS2hROU1NeVVOQW1nNmdJcldUNXgtTHJqeTA1M3VoSnpob2pRYWJVeWIwT0szR0VCZUpOaWRqeW5QeDVxQWJlUzMzQjFlTmpXb3Q2b1lKbWpZOVkwTEpndlVUd2FfdjJ3TEFqVl83SkFrY1hkOVZoSjLSAa4BQVVfeXFMT3VQX1JidDJrOFFnOUZ1NE1WanBsZWZQa2ZYM0xqSWtTck83TDJ1VUNpYnFsc1B6WDdwYTMtY2J5amNGdFpiamNoMkRvMFd3NzRwbHFSeEc4WUFyaFItakJTMklqZzRNcF9ZUV9NVVRuWElYOGJXZGpFYnpkLThnOGp6bEU3c2ZjT1JCN2xMS2JUblBPR0J5TXczMW40X2ZUSk1DTDZoOVdhUlhETFFn</guid></item><item><title>花生灵丹妙药：每天只吃少量零食可以减缓衰老-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNWmVwaFVEM3hHTHV1QngtaHY3LVZreWM2Q2l6LWMzUG90cTNuSHp2LXh3ejc2dHhPNXhFN01MVmRyWl9XUEEyRFJXVmNkZWJsWXhqT3BXZG5sc0hlVkw5SUx4Z3V0SXR4MDhCME8zR2FtajV5RmZpdG9UcjhleXFnUjlwakxMbGtuNklzSm4zdDFxVndZZFA2cWl5TDlQbkHSAaQBQVVfeXFMUGEtUUJwRk5BMWloRm51WFdjOWhzNmNsaFlEMnRrV21JTXhEaGgxczdMbHJLMElJb3BvQTlwTGZ6OXNybjlHckd5ZWp6SWxPeTVZVkVWV0tKNnctSWZ4cUZrVE9iX3FzUHNuejd1SEE1eS1RclBZbDViXy03V2k5NWp3S0x1QjFJSVdTNUJIQTY0VHBEOTFVN3BOdUw2RG5iaE5GelU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A study published in 2022 found a tenuous but plausible link between picking your nose and an increased risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cases where picking at your nose causes internal tissue damage, critical species of bacteria have a clearer path to the brain, which responds to their presence in ways that resemble signs of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170795" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are numerous caveats here, not the least of which is that the supporting research so far is in mice rather than humans, but the findings are definitely worth further investigation – and could improve our understanding of how Alzheimer's disease starts, which remains something of a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-breakthrough-lithium-reverses-memory-loss-in-mice"&gt;Alzheimer's Breakthrough: Lithium Reverses Memory Loss in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers led by scientists from Griffith University in Australia ran tests with a bacterium called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydia_pneumoniae"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chlamydia pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which can infect humans and cause  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pneumonia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73057" data-postid="170795" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria has &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004300050071"&gt;also been discovered&lt;/a&gt; in the majority of human brains affected by late-onset dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was demonstrated that in mice, the bacteria could travel up the olfactory nerve (joining the nasal cavity and the brain). What's more, when there was damage to the nasal epithelium (the thin tissue along the roof of the nasal cavity), nerve infections got worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led to the mouse brains depositing more of the amyloid-beta protein – a protein which is released in response to infections. Plaques (or clumps) of this protein are also found in significant concentrations in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-how-alzheimer-s-causes-cells-to-overheat-and-fry-like-eggs"&gt;people with Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_148468" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-148468" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/amyloid_plaques_642.jpg" alt="Mouse Study Suggests Surprising Link Between Alzheimer's And Nose-Picking" class="wp-image-148468 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/amyloid_plaques_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/amyloid_plaques_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-148468" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of amyloid-beta protein plaques, in orange.

It's thought that bacteria and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="170795" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; see the nose as a quick route to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's not certain that the effects will be the same in humans, or even that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-have-a-new-theory-about-what-causes-alzheimers-and-its-not-plaque"&gt;amyloid-beta plaques are a cause of Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, it's nevertheless important to follow up promising leads in the fight to understand this common neurodegenerative condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to do this study in humans and confirm whether the same pathway operates in the same way," &lt;a href="https://news.griffith.edu.au/2022/10/28/new-research-suggests-nose-picking-could-increase-risk-for-alzheimers-and-dementia/"&gt;said St John&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's research that has been proposed by many people, but not yet completed. What we do know is that these same bacteria are present in humans, but we haven't worked out how they get there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nose picking isn't exactly a rare thing. In fact, it's possible &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/nose-picking"&gt;as many as 9 out of 10 people&lt;/a&gt; do it… not to mention a bunch of other species (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weve-caught-aye-aye-using-its-wacky-long-finger-for-something-pretty-gnarly"&gt;some a little more adept&lt;/a&gt; than others). While the benefits aren't clear, studies like this one should give us pause before picking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_148469" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-148469" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/child_picking_nose_642.jpg" alt="child picking their nose" class="wp-image-148469 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/child_picking_nose_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/child_picking_nose_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-148469" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Nose picking: not just a habit for small children.

More muscle guaranteed, side order of grunting certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I’m not new to resistance training in my kitchen. Last year I shared with readers a &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/30-minute-kitchen-workout-advice-antonia-hoyle-9twg2j9ls" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;workout I had devised&lt;/a&gt;, finding it more practical than driving to a mansplaining gym. Drawing&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; inspiration from exercise classes I’d attended and personal trainers I’d interviewed as a health journalist, my routine focused on lots of repetitions of lighter weights, which improved my muscle endurance and cardiovascular fitness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This workout helped me to feel fitter at 45 than I have felt in my life. But I was also beginning to plateau. There were only so many times I could tweak my existing exercises or increase my reps to challenge myself. Like many women I know who have exercised for a long time, I needed a new approach. I needed to join the heavy weights gang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The benefits of heavier weight training go far beyond stopping the loss of muscle that accelerates in midlife, which most of us are now aware of. It can also help to regulate blood sugar levels and increase bone mineral density, which typically declines with oestrogen levels in menopause. Lifting heavier weights is likely to be better for fat loss than lifting light weights because it helps you to build more muscle — and because muscle tissue burns more energy than fat, even at rest, the more we have, the less susceptible we are to midlife spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It has also been found to be particularly good for the brain. Research in 2023 found that lifting weights at 80 per cent of participants’ 1RM (one rep max — the maximum weight you can lift) increased levels of the protein brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) whereas lifting weights at 60 per cent did not. BDNF aids neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to adapt and change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/strength-training-midlife-weight-workout-exercises-zd6vmqx09" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to start weight training in midlife&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The Los Angeles writer Casey Johnston’s new book, &lt;i&gt;A Physical Education&lt;/i&gt;, charts how powerlifting helped her to overcome years of unhealthy dieting and exercising. Although Johnson, 38, appeared to be super-fit — she ran half-marathons and did cardio several times a week — she argues that instead of focusing on getting a stronger body, her fitness routines were all based on burning calories “to help reveal her muscles underneath”. She was always exhausted and preoccupied with what her body looked like, trying to tone rather than get strong. “I was running more and more and eating less and less,” she has said — and was unaware that she was actually losing muscle in the process. Changing her workout to focus on lifting heavy weights transformed that. It was not about getting “smaller” but about “how you feel. It’s about protecting yourself,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;On Instagram the personal trainer Elizabeth Davies, 41, aka &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/thiswomanlifts/" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;@thiswomanlifts&lt;/a&gt;, describes “toning” as “a made-up term arguably designed to prey on women who have been conditioned for decades to fear getting bigger”. She adds: “We cannot tone a muscle. We cannot sculpt a muscle. We cannot blast fat around a muscle by exercising that muscle.” Muscle either increases in size, remains the same size or shrinks, she explains, and muscle is crucial for health, not aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I’ve become inspired by the American influencer Alicia Erickson, the Midlife Maven, who is a lifelong fitness fanatic like me but until recently of entirely average build. By 45 her regular running and CrossFit regime had started to feel taxing on her body. At 49 she started weight training instead and now boasts biceps of steel and abs you could crack a walnut on, with the emphasis very much on heavy weights. “Booties” are not built with light dumbbells, she recently said, her confidence exuding from every pore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.9"&gt;&lt;div id="c7df2301-3df3-404a-a477-72f4de4d5495"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;“I have more energy but most importantly I feel stronger, more resilient”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;ANDREW FOX FOR THE TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The fitness trainer Jack Hanrahan has noticed a rise in women swapping multiple sets of lighter dumbbells for heavy weightlifting. “Once you’ve mastered your form with lighter weights, going heavier is the sensible thing to do,” he says. “You’re not going to become stronger if you’re not challenging your muscles.” And, he adds, “heavy lifting changes the way my clients carry themselves. When you feel really strong, you feel more capable. It gives you more courage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Before I switched up my routine I wanted to know if it was safe to lift heavier weights in my kitchen, still not having the time or inclination to queue for complicated equipment in a weights room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/how-to-be-healthy-strong-fit-happy-at-50-c5gqkkn53" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meet your new midlife fitness guru: how to have a better body over 50&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Absolutely,” says the personal trainer Kate Rowe-Ham, who teaches midlife women to do just that via online classes on her app, Owning Your Menopause. “For some women it’s less intimidating lifting heavy weights at home than a gym because there’s no one to see you pull a funny face.” On Rowe-Ham’s recommendation I bought heavier dumbbells — 10kg (£56), 12.5kg (£68) and 15kg (£80) — from Factory Weights. An investment, obviously, but still cheaper than a gym membership. I also use a 6kg medicine ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;According to Hanrahan, some people worry that going heavier means a mandatory gym membership to avoid injury. But he says that if you are lifting slowly and carefully, you should be OK to do a heavy home workout. “You can handle heavier weights if you’re doing fewer reps because you’re under tension for less time,” he says. “If you can do the number of reps without failing, you’re strong enough. There’s no risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;What is important is correct form, he stresses. Swaying or swinging during a movement increases the risk of injury, as does pushing to the point of failure “because your form degrades and that means you’re probably transferring some force into the joints”, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Breathing correctly is also key. When muscles are “being lengthened and loaded and you need stability” — straightening your arm for a biceps curl or lowering for a squat, for example — breathe in through your nose because “it has a better connection to the diaphragm”, Hanrahan explains. “You’re more likely to breathe deeper, which activates the core muscles and stabilises the spine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There are 20 exercises in my new workout — 13 with heavier weights, along with seven conditioning exercises: jump squats, stomach crunches, oblique taps, lower abdominal raises, press-ups, triceps dips and a plank and side-plank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/strength-exercises-middle-age-midlife-2xc0g6mpf" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;5 easy exercises to keep you strong in midlife&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I can still do it in my small kitchen. Lifting heavier I do fewer repetitions of most exercises. For example, I do three sets of ten shoulder presses rather than 50 in one go. I still do “pulses” — smaller movements while in, say, a squat — to increase the time my muscles spend under tension. I allow five slow breaths, or about 30 seconds, between each set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I’ve also added deadlifts to place more emphasis on my glutes, hamstrings and lower back, as well as weighted hip thrusts, which also work these muscle groups. “We spend so long sitting down with these muscles inactive that it’s important to train our posterior chain,” Rowe-Ham says. I have added bent-over lateral rows to build my upper back muscles, triceps kickbacks for the backs of my arms and weighted core exercises. For my squats I have added 3.5kg weights I found in the garage to my 20kg barbell, meaning I’m squatting 23.5kg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Significantly I have sacrificed a spinning session to lift weights every other day (I used to do it every three days), setting my alarm for 5.30am. That’s painful but by the end of my session my heart pounds and I’m elated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;What I have really noticed is how I seem to burn through food now. I mostly eat healthily but I eat a lot, and a chocolate or chips blowout doesn’t seem to have an impact on the scales. I now weigh 6lb less than last summer and look a lot more muscly (according to my 14-year-old daughter). I have more energy but most importantly I feel stronger, more resilient. Cramming my weights back under the shoe rack at the end of a workout I feel as if I can take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;The heavy weight exercises that have transformed my fitness &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Barbell squats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three sets of 40 reps with a 23.5kg weight&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Use weights that allow you to lift the barbell comfortably over your head and rest it on the fleshiest part of your trapezius (upper back muscles). Hold the bar with both hands so your elbows are in line with your torso. With your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointing out, buttocks pushed back and back straight, lower as far as you can while keeping your back straight. Push up. I do 20 of these, then 20 pulses in each set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Rows&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two sets of 15 with a 12.5kg dumbbell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keeping your left arm straight, place your left palm and left knee on a chair or coffee table. Holding a heavy weight in your right hand, keep your right arm straight, perpendicular to the floor, and your right leg straight with your right foot on the floor. Bend forward. Keeping your back straight and your elbow close to your body, pull the weight towards your torso, squeezing your shoulder blade. Lower. Repeat on the opposite side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Biceps curls&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three sets of 12 reps with two 12.5kg dumbbells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stand with feet hip-width apart, back straight and shoulders down. Have a heavy weight in each hand with your arms by the side of your body, palms facing forward. Bend both elbows at the same time to curl your weights up to your shoulders, and lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Weighted lunges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;b&gt;50 reps with two 12.5kg dumbbells, leading on right foot, then 50 leading on left&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stand with feet pointing forward, hip-width apart, with arms by your sides and a heavy weight in each hand. Step forward with your right foot so both legs are bent at a 90-degree angle and your front thigh is parallel to the floor. Squeeze your buttocks as you return to the starting position. I repeat this 30 times, then do 20 pulses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/how-to-strengthen-and-tone-your-legs-exercise-routine-at-home-bzcdjvx9v" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to strengthen and tone your legs for summer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Weighted calf raises&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;b&gt;35 reps with two 12.5kg dumbbells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, arms by your sides, holding heavy weights.

Keeping your shoulders down and back straight, raise your arms to the sides until they’re parallel to the floor. The straighter your arms, the harder the exercise. Rest between each set (I use 10kg weights, up from 8kg, when I did 25 continuous reps).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Deadlifts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three sets of 15, 12 and 12 reps using two 15kg dumbbells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Standing feet hip-width apart, push your hips back and bend your knees slightly to grasp a barbell or two dumbbells at your feet, palms over the bar. Don’t let your knees extend over your toes.

The paper was published in &lt;a href="http://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.1536"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a broad term for a group of symptoms affecting memory, thinking, and social abilities severely enough to interfere with daily life. It is most commonly caused by Alzheimer’s disease, but other types include vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Dementia is progressive, meaning symptoms worsen over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early signs can include forgetfulness, difficulty finding words, and trouble with problem-solving or planning. As the condition advances, individuals may struggle to recognize familiar people, perform routine tasks, or regulate emotions. Although aging is the greatest risk factor, dementia is not a normal part of aging. Genetics, cardiovascular health, head injuries, and lifestyle factors also contribute to risk. Research suggests that maintaining physical activity, cognitive engagement, and a healthy diet may help reduce the likelihood of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Christina S. Dintica and colleagues sought to investigate whether dementia incidence varies across U.S. regions. They focused on older veterans enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis included 1,268,599 veterans aged 65 years or older who received care at VHA medical centers between October 1999 and September 2021. This group represented a randomly selected sample of about 5% of older veterans who used VHA services during those years. The average age was 73.9 years, and 2% were women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be included, participants had to have known zip code information so that researchers could determine their geographic location. Those without a zip code were excluded. Dementia diagnoses were identified using medical records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their zip codes, participants were classified into one of 10 U.S. regions, each composed of 4 to 7 states: Southeast (Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi); Southwest (Arizona, California, Hawai‘i, and Nevada); South Atlantic (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida); South (Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas); Rocky Mountains (Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming); Northwest (Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington); Northeast (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and New York); Midwest (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska); Mid-Atlantic (Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and New Jersey); and Great Lakes (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lowest dementia incidence was observed in the Mid-Atlantic (11.2 per 1,000 person-years) and the highest in the Southeast (14.0 per 1,000 person-years). Compared with the Mid-Atlantic, dementia risk was 25% higher in the Southeast, 23% higher in both the Northwest and Rocky Mountains, 18% higher in the South, and 12% higher in the Midwest and South Atlantic. In the remaining regions, rates were less than 10% higher than in the Mid-Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Among older adults in the VHA, dementia incidence varied significantly across US regions, independent of key covariates. These findings highlight the need for targeted health care planning, public health interventions, and policy development,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the regional variation in dementia incidence rates. However, it should be noted that the design of the study does not allow any causal inferences to be derived from the results. While the study reported differences between geographical regions, the specific factors underlying these regional variations remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="http://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.1536"&gt;Regional Differences in Dementia Incidence Among US Veterans,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Christina S.

ADHD-screened participants reported more frequent music use during both less demanding tasks and while studying, with a stronger preference for stimulating tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurotypical individuals tended toward relaxing, familiar music during cognitively heavy activities. Despite different preferences, both groups perceived similar boosts to concentration and mood from background music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Use in ADHD:&lt;/strong&gt; ADHD-screened participants used background music more often while studying and during sports than neurotypical peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulating Music Preference:&lt;/strong&gt; ADHD-screened listeners favored upbeat, stimulating music across both cognitive and non-cognitive tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Both groups reported similar perceived improvements in focus and emotional well-being from music.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Highlights how music can be a low-cost, customizable tool for supporting focus and mood in both neurotypical and ADHD individuals, offering potential as an accessible cognitive aid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How This Aligns with Previous Research:&lt;/strong&gt; Supports theories like the Moderate Brain Arousal model and Mood Arousal Theory, reinforcing evidence that stimulation needs differ between ADHD and neurotypical populations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Could inform the creation of personalized “cognitive playlists” and targeted music-based interventions to enhance learning, work performance, and emotional regulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Music&lt;/a&gt; is more than just a soundtrack to our lives—it’s a cognitive companion, an emotional regulator, and, for many, a daily necessity. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study comparing young adults with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) offers a deeper look into how background music is used during daily tasks, and why preferences may differ between these groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings reveal that while both neurotypical and &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=adhd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;-screened individuals value music’s role in focus and mood, the situations in which they use it—and the kind of music they choose—can diverge in intriguing ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers surveyed 434 adults aged 17 to 30, dividing them into two groups: those who screened positive for ADHD and those without attentional symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants reported on their weekly listening time, the types of activities they paired with background music, and their preferences for music style and characteristics. They also rated music’s perceived effects on their concentration and emotional state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activities were split into “more cognitive” (such as studying, reading, problem-solving) and “less cognitive” (like cleaning, cooking, or exercising).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that ADHD-screened participants reported more frequent background music use during certain situations—especially while studying and exercising—and in less cognitively demanding activities overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also had a stronger preference for stimulating music, regardless of the activity type. In contrast, neurotypical participants leaned more toward relaxing and familiar music during tasks requiring high concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, despite these differences in usage patterns, both groups rated music’s benefits to concentration and mood similarly, suggesting a shared appreciation for its cognitive and emotional lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These listening patterns fit neatly with two established psychological frameworks. The Cognitive Capacity Hypothesis proposes that our attentional resources are finite; complex tasks demand more of this “mental bandwidth,” leaving less capacity to process music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For individuals with ADHD, whose attentional control may already be more limited, music could serve as either a helpful arousal booster or a distracting extra load, depending on the context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Moderate Brain Arousal model offers another layer: people with ADHD may seek higher stimulation to reach optimal alertness, especially during repetitive or monotonous activities. Stimulating music, then, could be a deliberate strategy to keep focus steady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the role of emotional regulation. According to the Mood Arousal Theory, music can modulate both emotional valence (pleasantness) and arousal level, influencing performance in a task-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurotypical participants’ preference for relaxing, familiar tracks during challenging activities may reflect a strategy to maintain calm focus, while ADHD-screened listeners’ attraction to stimulating, sometimes less familiar tracks could help counteract low arousal and wandering attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings add valuable nuance to our understanding of music and attention, they also come with caveats. This was a self-report study rather than a controlled experiment, and ADHD status was determined via a screening questionnaire, not a clinical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, by capturing real-world listening habits rather than laboratory simulations, the research paints a realistic picture of how young adults integrate music into their daily cognitive routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is not a universal prescription—there’s no one “right” playlist for focus—but rather an invitation to think strategically about music use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with ADHD, stimulating, upbeat tracks might aid in sustaining attention for certain tasks, while neurotypical listeners may benefit from calming, instrumental choices during demanding work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies using brain imaging and controlled experiments could help clarify exactly how these choices affect neural activity, and whether personalized “cognitive playlists” could become a practical tool for enhancing focus and emotional well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the study makes one thing clear, it’s this: music isn’t just background noise—it’s an active ingredient in how we manage our minds. And the way we use it may say as much about our brains as it does about our tastes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this ADHD, music, and attention research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1508181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Listening habits and subjective effects of background music in young adults with and without ADHD&lt;/a&gt;” by Nathalie Gosselin et al. &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listening habits and subjective effects of background music in young adults with and without ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults listen to an average of 20.7 hours of music per week, according to a study conducted across 26 countries. Numerous studies indicate that listening to music can have beneficial effects on cognitive performance and emotional well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music listening habits may vary depending on individual needs and listening contexts. However, a limited number of studies have specifically examined the patterns of background music usage during various more or less cognitive activities, especially among individuals with attentional difficulties related to ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study primarily aimed to compare music listening habits during daily activities that are more and less cognitive (e.g., studying, problem-solving versus cleaning, engaging in sports) between neurotypical young adults and those screened for ADHD (respondents who were identified as likely having ADHD based on the number of self-reported symptoms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, 434 young adults aged 17 to 30 responded to an online survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicate that certain listening habits differ significantly between the neurotypical and ADHD-screened groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ADHD-screened group reports significantly more background music listening during less cognitive activities and while studying, compared to the neurotypical group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also reveal a difference in the proportion of individuals preferring stimulating music between the groups: ADHD-screened individuals report significantly more frequent listening to stimulating music, regardless of the activity type (more or less cognitive). Other aspects of music listening are common to both groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the group, more respondents reported preferring to listen to relaxing, instrumental, familiar and self-chosen music during more cognitive activities, whereas for less cognitive activities, more individuals mentioned preferring to listen to music that is stimulating, with lyrics, familiar and self-chosen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results confirm that most young adults listen to music during their daily activities and perceive positive effects from this listening.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 18:13:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFA0RERWLUxNTWkxbjNZSGxRcTVNamQyUktGUFU0TzRZMlFoSFRmSExZc1pVQ2Fpajd0YXdiejdXeDVpc2JiYWdlNXI4OHc2RVFoVjFnVnRaZ3V5eUtNZEJiYy1iTHpiNnQxVUVFSm1yNA</guid></item><item><title>传染病更新2025年8月10日-每日科斯</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQS0QydXpEa2s1MTdpUnAzR25ocTZ4MWZvNXhWQmU4TDhjQlByUHN6cS1pU29LdUc3WThtSlVkQ2tvekhvVVAyS2dFUW9rbU5nUTI3eWpLc1h3U1o0MWEyR3BhVldkZE00dnVzM1pmUXVlc2luTDNxdmd2cVhCU1V2WTRfMUlhbFk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;

Authorities say the outbreak, traced to broccoli in oil used in sandwiches, has raised urgent food safety concerns and triggered seizures of contaminated products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local media report that the victim, 52-year-old artist and musician Luigi Di Sarno, was on holiday with his family in Calabria when he purchased a broccoli and sausage sandwich from a vendor on the Diamante seafront in Cosenza province. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after eating, Di Sarno fell severely ill while driving home and died before reaching the hospital on Thursday. His family, two women in their 40s and two 17-year-olds, also became sick and required emergency treatment at Annunziata Hospital in Cosenza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical staff told reporters the patients showed signs consistent with botulism, a rare but potentially deadly illness caused by toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of Di Sarno’s relatives were in serious condition upon arrival at the intensive care unit, according to hospital sources. The Paola Public Prosecutor’s Office has ordered the seizure of broccoli jars in oil and impounded the food truck linked to the outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An autopsy is being finalized to determine the exact cause of death, but local outlets report botulism is strongly suspected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Second suspected &lt;keyword id="28239682" type="General" weightage="100" keywordseo="botulism-outbreak-in-Italy" source="keywords"&gt;botulism outbreak in Italy&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tragedy comes just days after a separate botulism scare in Sardinia, where eight people were hospitalized after consuming guacamole from a Mexican food stand at Fiesta Latina, held in Monserrato between July 22 and 25. Local authorities believe the dip may have been contaminated with the same toxin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To respond to both incidents, health officials have flown in vials of antitoxin serum to treat patients. They said, "No region or hospital in the country is authorised to store the antivenom in their own facilities. This serum, however, is exclusively available to the Ministry of Health, which holds it in designated secure locations and distributes it only through the Lombardy Poison Control Centre."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities continue to investigate both outbreaks while urging consumers to avoid eating recalled broccoli products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is botulism?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Botulism is a rare yet dangerous illness caused by a toxin that targets the body’s nerves and can lead to life-threatening complications. The toxin is produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. It can develop from contaminated food, infected wounds, or, in infants, when bacterial spores grow in the intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, botulism can occur when excessive amounts of botulinum toxin are injected for cosmetic or medical purposes. This uncommon type is known as iatrogenic botulism, with “iatrogenic” referring to a condition caused by medical treatment or examination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of foodborne botulism include Trouble swallowing or speaking, dry mouth, facial weakness on both sides of the face, blurred or double vision, drooping eyelids, trouble breathing, nausea, vomiting, and paralysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 16:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>蜱虫茁壮成长的温暖潮湿世界正在增加莱姆病和其他疾病的传播- KSL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxNc01uaWZ2bW1ZS2FUX010VnBjdXNoVnNZWEpfdlFoV0NIT055UWNVbjN4bk82R3NkWE94QzJBR1lXeEdCSFEtLVdIOUpiZmFFRDNLalh6MTNzTUhiSFNMeTlXRFpEMzh4NVhrTHdpN2NUdG1ZOUJ2X3dTSlhma0h1ZTgxOXRneU1iRVRXUmFWQjFLeHI4akIwS2szRUlhQktLU3RxdjBlVzJqQk9LZlJDV2xzU1dwaDY4dTMtNHptTXo2dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK — This year, people are seeking emergency care for tick bites at the highest level since 2017, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51354300" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;reported cases&lt;/a&gt; of Lyme disease have continued to rise through the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the increases are driven by warmer temperatures due to climate change and the expanding presence of ticks in more areas in the U.S. and Canada — including places where people are less familiar with the risks and how to prevent disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we first started doing this (in the mid-1980s), there were very few cases of Lyme disease reported in Canada. Lyme disease is pretty well established in Canada at this point," said Thomas Daniels, the director of the Louis Calder Center, Fordham University's biological field station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease-carrying deer ticks are mostly active when temperatures are above 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and they thrive in areas with at least 85% humidity, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It likes to be in humid areas, not wet areas, but humid areas," said Daniels. "If you sample on a lawn that gets baked in the sun all day, you're not going to find ticks. You go 20 feet into the woods where it's shady and the temperature's generally lower and there's more ground cover, you will find ticks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threat from ticks and mosquitoes, which drive transmission of diseases such as West Nile, dengue and malaria, is already increasing, including &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51354964" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;in Utah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of increases in temperature that we've already seen, because of human impacts on the climate, the temperature is already getting more suitable for transmission of disease here in the United States and North America," Erin Mordecai, an associate professor of biology at Stanford University, said at a news briefing on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Related:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while climate change is contributing to the expansion of tick habitats, it's not the sole driver. Human changes to landscapes also shape where ticks are found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's never just one factor, right?" Jean Tsao, a professor at Michigan State University who studies disease ecology, said at a news briefing. "In the continental U.S., most of the changes in the range is probably due to land use change affecting wildlife communities. Also, management of wildlife populations, such as the white-tailed deer. That plays a major role for many of these ticks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Lyme disease?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deer ticks, also known as black-legged ticks, are the prima&lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;y ticks that carry Lyme disease. During the nymph stage, when they are most active, the ticks are about the size of a poppy seed and are easy to miss. As they feed on blood, they can transmit pathogens, including the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. This transmission occurs through the tick's saliva, which enters the host's bloodstream during feeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Fallon, director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University, told CNN on Friday that infection can cause a range of multisystem symptoms. Once in the bloodstream, the bacteria can go to various parts of the body, including the heart, central nervous system, the brain or peripheral nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;Because of human impacts on the climate, the temperature is already getting more suitable for transmission of disease here in the United States and North America.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Erin Mordecai, associate professor of biology at Stanford University&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The onset of Lyme disease may also present in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most people think of the Lyme rash as a bull's-eye target rash. In fact, that's not the most common presentation," said Fallon. "The most common presentation is more of a pinkish, reddish rash. But the main thing is that it expands in size from a small rash to 5 centimeters or larger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fallon notes that some people may also see more than one rash on different parts of their body. As the disease develops without treatment, more serious symptoms may emerge. Symptoms may last for months or even years, said Fallon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's recognized mainly by the rash early on, if you're lucky enough to see it, and then later, by symptoms such as the neurologic symptoms that may manifest as a facial palsy or a meningitis causing severe headaches with stiff neck or shooting pains or severe stabbing pains," Fallon said. There may be cardiac symptoms such as palpitations or slow rhythms, muscle pain and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It can be profoundly debilitating," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Protective measures are 'not foolproof'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniels says that although there are measures that can be taken to decrease the likelihood of a tick bite, prevention methods are not foolproof. The most important protection against Lyme disease is tick removal as soon as possible, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key is to get the tick off you as quickly as possible. None of these (tick-borne) pathogens are transmitted very quickly, except for Powassan virus, which can be transmitted in as little as 15 minutes. But the infection rate for (humans) is very, very low," said Daniels. "For Lyme disease, you've got a 24- to 48-hour window of opportunity there to get the tick off, because it takes some time for the tick to gear up through its feeding to actually transmit the bacteria."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniels advises people to wear more clothes in the summertime. "The longer we can keep the tick on the outside of our bodies and not on our skin, the less likely it is to find a place to attach." Clothes can also be treated with permethrin, an insecticide that repels ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;(Lyme disease) can be profoundly debilitating.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Brian Fallon, director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When hiking, Fallon advises people to stay on the trail, as ticks roam in leafy areas and wood piles. Daniels advises people to conduct a "tick check" for themselves and each other if they're in an area with ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's helpful because the ticks may go behind your knee, or they may go and bite you in the back, and you can't see your back or reach your back. Take a shower at the end of the day, because that may help to wash off some ticks that haven't fully attached yet," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a tick is attached for a prolonged period of time, Fallon says that it would gradually "blow up as big as a raisin" from continuously sucking blood. If you do find a tick, experts advise people to use tweezers to remove the tick from underneath its body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't try to burn it off with a cigarette. Don't try to put anything toxic on it. Remove it with a tweezer," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams — who served during the first Trump administration — argued Sunday that "people are going to die" if the U.S. backs away from mRNA vaccine development, after Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. halted around $500 million in research funding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-halts-500-million-for-mrna-vaccine-research/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; last week that the administration was canceling 22 mRNA vaccine development projects, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1952851097019633766" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; the vaccines "fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu." The projects were funded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA. Kennedy said the funds would be shifted toward "safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams, who appeared Sunday on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan," said Kennedy's assertions about the efficacy of mRNA vaccines are "simply not true" — citing their effectiveness in the COVID-19 pandemic, during which hundreds of millions of people took Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that by the most conservative estimates, upward of 2 million lives have been saved because of mRNA technology," Adams said. "It helped us develop COVID-19 vaccines in record time. And it's, quite frankly, President Trump's greatest achievement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mRNA technology was central to Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership aimed at quickly developing COVID-19 vaccines at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic near the end of Mr. Trump's first term. If the U.S. had relied on older vaccine technology, it could have taken an extra 18 to 24 months to develop COVID-19 shots, Adams said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about Kennedy's move by CBS News earlier this week, Mr. Trump said, "Operation Warp Speed was, whether you're Republican or a Democrat, considered one of the most incredible things ever done in this country," while noting that he had upcoming meetings on the topic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams, who was involved in the Operation Warp Speed effort, said it's "fascinating" to him that, as Mr. Trump and his allies discuss whether he deserves a Nobel Prize, "the thing that he should be considered for the Nobel Prize for, his health secretary is trying to undermine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former surgeon general explained that mRNA is a type of natural molecule that's present in the body and operates like a "recipe card that tells your body how to make a protein." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond COVID-19, Adams said the technology "helps us develop vaccines and new treatments" in other areas — from cancers and HIV to the flu and the Zika virus. The funding cuts could halt progress in one of the "most promising areas of modern medicine," the former surgeon general said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These are advances that are not going to happen now," Adams said. "People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;After Atlanta CDC shooting, Adams said "Secretary Kennedy has failed in his first major test"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams also criticized Kennedy for his response to a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-atlanta-shooting-cdc-emory-university-what-we-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;shooting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; outside Centers for Disease Control and Prevention buildings in Atlanta on Friday. Investigators have been looking into possible motives, including the possibility that the suspect believed he was sick as a result of the COVID vaccine, multiple sources told &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-atlanta-shooting-cdc-emory-university-what-we-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How you respond to a crisis defines a leader. Quite frankly, Secretary Kennedy has failed in his first major test in this regard," Adams said, accusing Kennedy of issuing "tepid response" to the  shooting, while adding, "and that's not even considering how his inflammatory rhetoric in the past have actually contributed to a lot of what's been going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1954197860754350238" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Friday, Kennedy said, "No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others." But Adams argued Kennedy has not "unequivocally condemned the violence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's an out there," Adams said. "If you don't believe that people are working to protect the public, then that means it's okay to commit violence, at least in some people's eyes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former surgeon general said people at the CDC were calling him after the shooting asking him to make a public statement "because they felt under attack." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They didn't know if this was going to continue," Adams said. "They were scared, and they wanted someone, someone who they felt had a public voice, to go out there and say, 'This is wrong. Violence is wrong.'"&lt;/p&gt;

In November 2023, she then underwent a "stem cell transplant from a donor to help her create healthy new blood cells and reduce the risk of the cancer returning," according to the news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I felt really good after the stem cell transplant,” Smith said. “I’ve always been on the go, really active and busy, and I felt like my usual self again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was still coming for regular check-ups at Clatterbridge and, in September 2024, my routine bone marrow biopsy showed I had relapsed and the cancer was back. I just wasn’t expecting it so, as you can imagine, I was completely shocked," she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was a Tuesday and I went home thinking this was the end for me, then on the Friday I got a lovely phone call from the consultant, Dr. Saif, to say he’d been working behind the scenes to try and find another treatment for me and I’d been accepted for CAR-T therapy," she added, referencing the chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, which is a highly innovative form of immunotherapy, per the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Byrne/PA Images via Getty&lt;/p&gt; A photo of the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre in Liverpool, U.K.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/treatment-types/immunotherapy/car-t-cell.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;, CAR-T therapy "is a way to get immune cells called T cells (a type of white blood cell) to fight cancer by changing them in the lab so they can find and destroy cancer cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This type of treatment can be very helpful in treating some types of cancer, even when other treatments are no longer working," according to the society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking about being accepted for the treatment, Smith said, “I went from literally the worst time in life to feeling like I’d just won the lottery because there was a little bit of hope there," per the news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to CAR-T therapy not being available in Liverpool until the end of 2024, Smith was referred to The Christie in Manchester for her to receive treatment as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the approximately 34-mile journey to Manchester was "exhausting," adding, "We were over and back about 20 times in all for consultations, cell collection, chemotherapy, infusion and follow-up appointments afterwards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust&lt;/p&gt; Sharon Smith&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith also had to stay in the city for three and a half weeks "during the most intensive stage of treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having gone to Manchester to have T cells taken from her blood, Smith's cells were then taken to a specialist pharmaceutical laboratory to be transformed into a "unique" CAR-T treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She then had to undergo chemotherapy in Manchester to prepare her body before the treatment began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite some side effects, the treatment was successful and Smith "recovered quickly," according to the hospital's news release.

&lt;p&gt;We at &lt;a href="https://www.traveloffpath.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Travel Off Path&lt;/a&gt; are not here to fearmonger — we're just here to report the facts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nor is this article sponsored by Pfizer…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The truth is, we all relate to you and hope that any news coming from the CDC remains in the rear-view mirror because who could possibly want to relive what we all went through in 2020?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While ever-changing variants of COVID are here to stay, the CDC is honing in on another harmful disease that was thought to be put to bed in the 1950s when yet another controversial vaccine hit the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For travelers ready to make use of their passport and &lt;a href="https://www.traveloffpath.com/american-airlines-launching-5-new-routes-to-popular-international-destinations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;jet off to Europe&lt;/a&gt;, beyond entry requirements and travel advisories, there's now another checklist to review before planning you dream vacation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC is reporting &lt;strong&gt;Polio&lt;/strong&gt; is circulating across some of Europe's most popular countries, therefore it's important to double check your medical records to ensure you're not at risk catching a virus that was stopped in its tracks decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In total, 39 countries have been listed as potential Polio hotspots, but you're unlikely to travel to Gaza or Djibouti, so we've narrowed it down to the 5 European countries at risk for the spread of Polio.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel Tip: Before jetting off to Europe, it's not only medical records you'll want to seek out. Make sure to dot your I's and cross your T's for a smooth trip abroad by utilizing Travel Off Path's new &lt;a href="https://www.traveloffpath.com/with-dozens-of-new-travel-rules-this-1-minute-check-is-now-essential-for-every-traveler/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;1-Minute Trip Check&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polio? That Still Exists?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen, let's not get into a deep discussion of vaccinations. We'll save that for other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;None of us could say “mama” or “dada” to even give our consent to receive the first dose of the Polio shot, which you likely received around 2 months old, followed by another round or two before your first birthday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Polio vaccine is required to attend public school, so parents are hamstrung deciding between injecting their babies or committing to homeschooling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reason the shot is required is that Polio can be a crippling illness, ultimately fatal at times, or at the very least highly debilitating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus affected hundreds of thousands worldwide in the first half of the 20th century — there's no denying that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though, there's an argument to be made that it wasn't solely the Polio vaccine driving down case numbers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The point is that there's a noticeable uptick in the disease for the CDC to trigger an official &lt;em&gt;Level 2 – Practice Enhanced Precautions&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/global-polio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;health alert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Polio, short for” poliomyelitis”, is indeed back, and not the comeback worthy of an LL Cool J song. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is no cure for Polio. That's why the CDC encourages all travelers traveling internationally to one of the 39 countries listed to double-check they're &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/polio/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fpolio%2Fpublic%2Findex.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;up to date&lt;/a&gt; on vaccinations as it's stated by &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/children/what-is-polio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt; that “You're at risk of getting polio if you're unvaccinated. If you have been vaccinated, it is extremely rare for you to get it”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most Adults Are Currently Protected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are fully in tandem with the CDC on this — it's highly important to wash your hands. You see, every country has different sanitary standards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you see India's street food enter your TikTok algorithm, you'll understand…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As gross as it sounds, Polio is spread through fecal matter. As such, we're always simply trusting that our food handlers are following a hygienic protocol by thoroughly washing their hands, but that's not always the case, hence endless food poisoning horror stories when traveling abroad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is most adults are protected against Polio since it was a required vaccination, but &lt;strong&gt;adult boosters may be an option&lt;/strong&gt; if vaccinated as a child and have not received a booster before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the CDC is reminding parents that children should be vaccinated 4 times at this schedule, especially if you're traveling internationally in the near future:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st does – 2months old&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;2nd dose – 4 months old&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;3rd dose – 6 – 18 months old&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;4th dose – 4 – 6 years old&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full List Of 39 Destinations With Circulating Poliovirus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chances are a majority of the following list won't be on your travel radar any time soon unless you're the rare type of traveler that views some of Africa's most dangerous countries as a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, what's most surprising from the CDC's health alert is that some of Europe's most popular nations are affected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, if you're planning a trip to Oktoberfest festivities next month in &lt;a href="https://www.traveloffpath.com/these-4-secret-destinations-in-germany-offer-medieval-charm-authentic-culture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, you might want to request a copy of your medical records.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Germany is not alone. Finland, Poland, Spain, and the UK have all seen enough cases to warrant an official warning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you haven't been vaccinated, the most concerning aspect of Polio is that there may be no symptoms at all, yet you may still be infected (sounds familiar, right?).&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="11" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme37lqba000w3b79nb30etjv@published"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://slate.com/tag/one-thing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;One Thing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a column with tips on how to live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme37nim4001g3b79fgb30fxj@published"&gt;I used to luxuriate in 90-minute yoga classes at a studio an hour away. Then came two kids, and a slew of family responsibilities: My mother fell ill, and then died. My grandmother came to live upstairs from us for the last 2½ years of her of her life. Currently, my father is in chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme37nim8001h3b79l7t9eb7j@published"&gt;Suffice it to say, I’m well acquainted with fight-or-flight mode. As a yoga teacher myself, I’ve felt like a fraud standing in front of people looking to me for a calming experience while I was personally a bundle of nerves.&lt;/p&gt;




  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme37nim9001i3b794dwyxofm@published"&gt;On a quest for self-regulation, I realized: Integrating little bits of yoga and other exercise into my day is a sanity saver. And I mean, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; little. Before running downstairs to change the laundry, I stop for a 20-second chest stretch with my arms in the doorframe. Before running back up, a calf stretch on the bottom step. I accompanied my dad to chemo last week, and while he was in the bathroom, I waited in the hall in a deep squat.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme37nim9001j3b79akxusqpm@published"&gt;This is not &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2022/04/minute-workout-hiit-new-york-times.html"&gt;the seven-minute workout&lt;/a&gt;, promising to get you fit in no time. It certainly won’t hurt your fitness to do these stretches and moves, but fitness isn’t the point. The point &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an interruption of the nervous system’s stress response. Stress accumulates all day long, so why shouldn’t stress reduction be ongoing, too? When my body feels better, so does my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme37nim9001k3b796wfiu6lx@published"&gt;Sure, ideally, this comes on top of a longer self-care routine. Here’s a best-case scenario: You wake up early, break a sweat, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; sit to meditate, all before breakfast! Gold stars!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme37nim9001l3b79nwo3ucyi@published"&gt;But then … you are filling lunchboxes and packing backpacks and the dog needs to go out and the kids are arguing over a Pokémon card, their beds unmade (purely hypothetical). Then, the water starts overflowing in the pot of oatmeal on the stove, and you are yelling. Why not instead bust out a downward dog? Or at least, once the kids are off to school, recalibrate with 30 seconds of &lt;a href="https://sarapamneufeld.substack.com/p/alternate-nostril-breathing-tutorial"&gt;alternate nostril breathing&lt;/a&gt; (in one side and out the other).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme37nim9001m3b79g7hd9xhu@published"&gt;Here are a bunch of other ideas for mini-movements: Shake out your body. Give yourself a quick jaw or foot massage. Lie with your legs up the wall, or stand barefoot in grass. Sitting in traffic? Try a box breath (in four, hold four, out four, hold four, all with the nose). Lightly cupping the hands over the eyes and blinking makes for a lovely break when you’re at the computer. Stand on one leg when brushing teeth. Heel raises pair well with washing dishes. The key is to find a handful of exercises soothing to you—and then, eventually, to learn to deploy them in high-stress situations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="20" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme37nima001n3b79jak1ft65@published"&gt;I still get overwhelmed—that’s life. But when I do, it’s easier to bring myself back to a state of &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;calm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/early-diagnosis-surge-for-CRC?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:news release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt; Monday, Elizabeth Schafer, the lead author of the study and a surveillance and health equity scientist, called the findings "promising news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The uptick of cases is likely due to first-time screening in the wake of new recommendations for younger average-risk adults to begin testing for colorectal cancer earlier," Schafer explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook, who is a gastroenterologist, called the findings "really good news," noting that early detection means it's very likely to be curable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they're in the very earliest stage, they're more than 90% curable," he said &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/why-more-colon-cancer-cases-are-being-detected-early/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:on "CBS Mornings,";elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;on "CBS Mornings,"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are symptoms of colon cancer to be aware of — including changes in bowel habits, constipation, bleeding and fatigue — LaPook said proper screening can prevent people from getting to the point where symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If at any point you do a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colonoscopy-adr-withdrawal-time-ask-your-doctor/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:colonoscopy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and you find a benign polyp that was destined to become a colon cancer, and you remove it, instead of getting colon cancer, you do not get colon cancer," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another lead author, Jessica Star, who does cancer risk factors and screening surveillance research at the ACS, said it's "thrilling" to see increases in screening rates among younger adults as well as its likely ties into rises in earlier stage diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she warned there's a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Screening for colorectal caner in ages 45-49 remains suboptimal and has not increased equitably by both education attainment and insurance status," Star said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, medical associations expressed concern after a report that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-preventive-health-panel-concerns-medical-associations/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:may remove all members;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;may remove all members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a panel of independent medical experts whose recommendations help guide insurance companies and doctors' decisions about a range of preventive health measures, like cancer screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thomas Lew, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine and attending physician of hospital medicine at Stanford Health Care Tri-Valley, recently told CBS News that a change like this would "greatly damage all the work we've done in preventative care, making people sicker, and driving up costs and premiums."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To put it mildly, this is extremely concerning — and doing the opposite of making America healthy," Lew said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to CBS News at the time, an HHS spokesperson said, "No final decision has been made on how the USPSTF can better support HHS' mandate to Make America Healthy Again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/israels-security-cabinet-approves-plan-to-take-over-gaza-city-1?ftag=YHFaf537c7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Israel's Security Cabinet approves plan to take over Gaza City;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Israel's Security Cabinet approves plan to take over Gaza City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/why-trump-calling-for-intel-ceo-immediate-resignation?ftag=YHFaf537c7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Why Trump is calling for Intel CEO's immediate resignation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Why Trump is calling for Intel CEO's immediate resignation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/2-year-old-hairless-french-bulldog-mix-wins-ugliest-dog-contest?ftag=YHFaf537c7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2-year-old hairless French bulldog mix wins ugliest dog contest;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2-year-old hairless French bulldog mix wins ugliest dog contest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 12:42:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5rSTZyN18yU3E0MFpNWXgwWWI4ZUZEQnlJbFJRS18zQzlpeEdCSDlEai1LdVNHT1VpaTU1cW1BMkRxUXZVdnJ1M3ZTSzdlTVk4Sk9YYXVPclpQeW1PN3RKRFgtYVQzUTZqYWRuV3lvUmdWd0E</guid></item><item><title>我有一个$ 4,500的全身核磁共振成像来捕捉隐藏的健康风险-以下是它的发现-预防</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBVVkg0X1NIU09vU0xTTW9MNGFCSXZzNWgxTmk1YWtFT0MySnlMVkhIcUJiZnFKa1VEQzM0MXZ5U2tjcjlqamtWMU12Mk5lNkhRNEx6S3VoRXFwdVF3a2xDQmE0UFVjMTc4VnJfc2c5dUlybkY2OE84cXZvTG9tRnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-zl6cs0 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I’ve always believed in being proactive about my health, but like most people, I usually only see a doctor when something feels wrong or if I’m overdue for an annual exam. That changed when I learned about the Prenuvo scan—a whole-body MRI designed to detect serious conditions like cancer, aneurysms, and degenerative diseases before symptoms appear. The idea of a non-invasive, radiation-free scan that could potentially catch issues early intrigued me. Still, I was skeptical. It’s not a medically necessary procedure, is quite pricey (more on this later), and not widely available. Would it be just another wellness trend wrapped in high-tech marketing, or could it actually be the latest &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a62604507/biggest-health-breakthroughs-of-2024/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a62604507/biggest-health-breakthroughs-of-2024/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="health breakthrough" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;health breakthrough&lt;/a&gt;—or better yet, a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/g65384553/life-saving-health-screenings-women-over-40/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/g65384553/life-saving-health-screenings-women-over-40/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="life-saving health screening" data-node-id="1.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;life-saving health screening&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Prenuvo has gained a lot of attention lately, especially after celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner publicly endorsed it, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvszJqGyfqr/?" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvszJqGyfqr/?" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="calling it" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;calling it&lt;/a&gt; a “life-saving machine.” Though I don’t have an endless health budget of a Hollywood elite, I was lucky enough to receive a complimentary &lt;a href="https://www.prenuvo.com/enhanced-screening?" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prenuvo.com/enhanced-screening?" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Enhanced Screening" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Enhanced Screening&lt;/a&gt;. I’m 27 years old, generally healthy, and have no major concerns aside from some chronic neck pain and degenerative disc disease, of which I’ve already had imaging and treatment. Still, with a family history of cancer and a growing awareness that symptoms don’t always show up until it’s too late (I’ve worked at &lt;em data-node-id="2.5"&gt;Prevention&lt;/em&gt; for years), the opportunity to really see what’s going on inside my body excited me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="3" class="body-tip css-1707dxl emevuu60"&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://www.prenuvo.com/medical-leadership-team#dr-daniel-durand-md" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prenuvo.com/medical-leadership-team#dr-daniel-durand-md" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Daniel Durand, M.D., M.B.A." data-node-id="3.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Daniel Durand, M.D., M.B.A.&lt;/a&gt;, chief medical officer and president of Prenuvo Medical Group; &lt;a href="https://www.drberry.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.drberry.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ken Berry, M.D." data-node-id="3.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Ken Berry, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, family physician and co-author of &lt;em data-node-id="3.5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Labs-Practical-Decoding/dp/1628606010?tag=prevention-auto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Labs-Practical-Decoding/dp/1628606010" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Common Sense Labs" data-vars-ga-product-id="d09fd9bf-c79a-400d-8419-8f19e41f2abb" data-node-id="3.5.0" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Labs-Practical-Decoding/dp/1628606010" data-product-url="https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Labs-Practical-Decoding/dp/1628606010" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Labs-Practical-Decoding/dp/1628606010?tag=prevention-auto-20" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/woHq/amazon-s-common-sense-labs-practical-decoding-dp-1628606010","site_id":"d55f98dc-cbd6-4679-ae11-243969f8c772","network":{"name":"Amazon"},"metadata":{"links":{"default":"https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Labs-Practical-Decoding/dp/1628606010?tag=prevention-auto-20","sem":"https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Labs-Practical-Decoding/dp/1628606010?tag=pv-lift-20","social":"https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Labs-Practical-Decoding/dp/1628606010?tag=pv-soc-lift-20"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="97f2675b-fe25-442c-a94d-1cb544220c81" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-inlxvj e1aq0z090"&gt;Common Sense Labs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;; and &lt;a href="https://www.miakazanjian.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.miakazanjian.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mia Kazanjian, M.D." data-node-id="3.7" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Mia Kazanjian, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, board-certified radiologist specializing in breast and body imaging &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The entire process, from booking the appointment to the scan itself to my post-scan consultation, was overall a positive experience.

Whole-body MRI, on the other hand, does exactly what it sounds like: It uses the same magnetic resonance imaging technology to take a picture of the &lt;em data-node-id="7.3"&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; body, which, at Prenuvo, takes about an hour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Typically, imaging is done in a very focused manner based on a specific question that another physician is asking,” says &lt;a href="https://www.prenuvo.com/medical-leadership-team#dr-daniel-durand-md" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prenuvo.com/medical-leadership-team#dr-daniel-durand-md" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Daniel Durand, M.D., M.B.A." data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Daniel Durand, M.D., M.B.A.&lt;/a&gt;, chief medical officer and president of Prenuvo Medical Group. “What Prenuvo does is digitize the entire body. You can think of Prenuvo as a tech-enabled, direct-to-specialist care model. We’re digitizing the human body with the most powerful tool, which is MRI, and then we’re having a radiologist do a head-to-toe, on the inside, examination of the patient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;An important note about the limitations of whole-body MRI: “Preunvo exists to layer on top of existing screenings. This is in addition to, &lt;em data-node-id="9.1"&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a replacement of, and we have always said that,” Dr. Durand explains. “The idea is that if you have a primary care doctor and you’re doing your routine screenings, Prenuvo supercharges all that.

This included a whole-body MRI, which covered the brain, chest, abdomen, pelvis, spine, and major vasculature, free from radiation or contrast; a body composition analysis and advanced brain health assessment (taken during the MRI); and a comprehensive bloodwork panel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The actual experience of getting the MRI was fairly painless. Before the procedure, I was sent a fairly lengthy survey of my medical history to determine whether it was safe for me to undergo the scan and ascertain any health concerns I may have. I also took Prenuvo up on the offer to take a light sedative before heading in to ease any anxiety or claustrophobia to make the experience more comfortable. Then, I arrived at the Manhattan location ready to sit still in an MRI machine for just about an hour. Surprisingly, that hour went by pretty quickly. They gave me the option to choose a show or movie to watch on Netflix during the scan (I decided on Ginny and Georgia), which helped move things along mentally. Before I knew it, I was heading home, where a nurse from a concierge service employed by Prenuvo later drew my blood for the bloodwork portion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;About two weeks after my scan, Prenuvo reached out to schedule my post-scan consultation with &lt;a href="https://prenuvo.com/medical-leadership-team#dr-vikash-modi-md" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://prenuvo.com/medical-leadership-team#dr-vikash-modi-md" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vikash Modi, M.D." data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Vikash Modi, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, senior medical director of preventative medicine at Prenuvo. My virtual consultation with Dr. Modi lasted about 45 minutes, and he walked me through my scan, all of my bloodwork, my body composition analysis, and brain health assessment. He also answered any questions I had and gave me a few suggestions regarding my health moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-25" data-node-id="15" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="woman standing in diagnostic imaging room featuring a prenuvo mri machine" title="Woman standing in diagnostic imaging room featuring a Prenuvo MRI machine" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image-1-6883ba57f3b1c.jpeg?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image-1-6883ba57f3b1c.jpeg?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image-1-6883ba57f3b1c.jpeg?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image-1-6883ba57f3b1c.jpeg?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-1am3yn9 e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-dgbau5 e1geg53v2"&gt;Courtesy of Shannen Zitz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;About a week prior to officially receiving my results, I got a call from Dr. Modi to discuss one potentially urgent finding from my bloodwork. My blood panel showed that I had a glucose level of 38, which can be very dangerous. We discussed that this was likely due to fasting all day before the bloodwork (which I had scheduled for 3:00 p.m.), as my &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/9731-a1c" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/9731-a1c" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="A1c" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;A1c&lt;/a&gt; (a blood test that measures the average blood glucose from the last two-to-three months) was normal. But I was advised to repeat bloodwork with my primary care physician as a precaution. Dr. Modi then reassured me that there were no other major findings on my scan or my bloodwork, but that we would discuss it further at my official consultation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Fast forward to that appointment: Dr. Modi thoroughly went over my results, starting with my bloodwork, then my scan, the brain health assessment, and finally body composition analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Thankfully, my bloodwork showed I’m in good health, which was reassuring since the blood panel was very comprehensive. However, as Dr. Berry explains, “comprehensive” doesn’t always mean “useful.” While it did give me a lot of peace of mind, Dr. Berry says that “although most doctors don’t order enough bloodwork, as I discuss in &lt;em data-node-id="19.1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Labs-Practical-Decoding/dp/1628606010?tag=prevention-auto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Labs-Practical-Decoding/dp/1628606010" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Common Sense Labs" data-vars-ga-product-id="d09fd9bf-c79a-400d-8419-8f19e41f2abb" data-node-id="19.1.0" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Labs-Practical-Decoding/dp/1628606010" data-product-url="https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Labs-Practical-Decoding/dp/1628606010" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Labs-Practical-Decoding/dp/1628606010?tag=prevention-auto-20" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/woHq/amazon-s-common-sense-labs-practical-decoding-dp-1628606010","site_id":"d55f98dc-cbd6-4679-ae11-243969f8c772","network":{"name":"Amazon"},"metadata":{"links":{"default":"https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Labs-Practical-Decoding/dp/1628606010?tag=prevention-auto-20","sem":"https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Labs-Practical-Decoding/dp/1628606010?tag=pv-lift-20","social":"https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Labs-Practical-Decoding/dp/1628606010?tag=pv-soc-lift-20"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="97f2675b-fe25-442c-a94d-1cb544220c81" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-inlxvj e1aq0z090"&gt;Common Sense Labs&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; it is also true that ordering too much labwork creates a new set of problems,” including confusion and the potential for reacting when it may not be medically needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;My scan, however, did show &lt;strong data-node-id="20.1"&gt;one moderate finding&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong data-node-id="20.3"&gt;four minor findings&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong data-node-id="20.5"&gt;one informational finding&lt;/strong&gt;.

However, Dr. Modi reassured me that the online interface is always being updated, and that the patient-facing side doesn’t always align perfectly with the clinical interpretation. In my case, it may have been caused by head injuries I sustained during my time as a cheerleader. I had no signs of white matter disease, aneurysm, growths, or masses, and overall, my brain volume was very healthy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="23.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.1.0"&gt;Scoliosis. &lt;/strong&gt;I knew about this “minor finding” previously from a recent X-ray. I have “mild” scoliosis in my lumbar spine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="23.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.2.0"&gt;Spondyloarthropathy of the cervical and thoracic spine.&lt;/strong&gt; These are two “minor findings” I was also aware of from previous imaging. Spondyloarthropathy is the medical term for degenerative arthritis. I have long struggled with neck and upper back pain, and have been undergoing treatment (mainly physical therapy) for a few months now. Discussing these findings with Dr. Modi reassured me that I’m doing everything right in my current treatment plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="23.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.3.0"&gt;Hemorrhagic ovarian cysts. &lt;/strong&gt;This was my only “moderate finding;” one that I was not previously aware of. While I’m not experiencing any symptoms due to these benign, fluid-filled &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a42097713/ovarian-cysts/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a42097713/ovarian-cysts/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ovarian cysts" data-node-id="23.3.2" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;ovarian cysts&lt;/a&gt;, I’m glad I know about them now in case they ever do rupture or cause any complications. While Dr. Modi didn’t officially diagnose me, he suggested these may be a sign of polycystic ovary syndrome (&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a27456194/how-to-lose-weight-with-pcos/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a27456194/how-to-lose-weight-with-pcos/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="PCOS" data-node-id="23.3.4" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;PCOS&lt;/a&gt;) due to my semi-irregular menstrual cycle, history of acne, and recent struggle to lose weight. He suggested some supplements I might consider taking and made me aware of the typical treatment and medications doctors usually prescribe, should I ever seek that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="23.4"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.4.0"&gt;Dense breast tissue.&lt;/strong&gt; The scan also revealed that I have dense breast tissue, which means I have more glandular tissue (as opposed to fat tissue) in my breasts, which may make it more difficult to screen for breast cancer with a typical mammogram. I was already aware of this, as I have a history of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a23566271/woman-armpit-cyst-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a23566271/woman-armpit-cyst-breast-cancer/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="breast cysts" data-node-id="23.4.2" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;breast cysts&lt;/a&gt;, which is why I get regular ultrasounds. I was a little surprised the Prenuvo MRI did not pick these up, but Dr. Modi explained that the threshold for breast cysts at Prenuvo is around five millimeters. So, anything smaller than that (which my cysts likely are) would not be picked up by the MRI. “It’s a see-a-lot test, not a see-everything test,” Dr. Modi said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Following my bloodwork and MRI scan, Dr. Modi went over my brain health assessment, which measured the volume of &lt;em data-node-id="24.1"&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; structure within the brain. Thankfully, all of those structures in my brain fell into normal ranges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Finally, we discussed my body composition analysis, which showed data for total muscle mass, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat. This test is very useful, says Dr. Berry. “Knowing visceral fat and muscle mass is much better than just looking at Body Mass Index (BMI),” he explains. (Note: &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/a38256590/is-bmi-accurate/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/a38256590/is-bmi-accurate/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Prevention no longer uses BMI as a measurement of health" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="25.1.0"&gt;Prevention&lt;/em&gt; no longer uses BMI as a measurement of health&lt;/a&gt;.) Again, thankfully, Dr. Modi ensured that for the most part, my analysis falls into “normal” ranges for my age and sex, except that I actually have a bit more muscle mass than average, which is a good thing. This test was really interesting to look at because it included a very detailed analysis of hip and lower body muscle volume, as well as a symmetry analysis. None of this was major, but it did confirm a few things I suspected about the way my body works and moves.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="26" data-lazy-id="P0-28"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Are whole-body MRIs the future of preventative healthcare?" data-anchor-id="are-whole-body-mris-the-future-of-preventative-healthcare" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Are whole-body MRIs the future of preventative healthcare?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s difficult to say. “The essence of what Prenuvo does, and I think it’s poorly understood, is that we don’t by ourselves prevent anything. But, we can absolutely help a patient choose their own destiny and pursue the right preventative strategies, because we can show them what’s going on in them, as opposed to just general advice,” Dr. Durand explains. However, as Dr. Durand and the Prenuvo website state, there are limitations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I asked Dr. Berry, an unaffiliated family physician, whether whole-body MRIs can meaningfully replace or reduce the need for standard individualized screenings based on modern-day recommendations. He said, not right now. It doesn’t replace guideline-based screening. “It can’t do what a colonoscopy or mammogram does, and it doesn’t offer the same level of detail. It’s a supplemental tool, not a substitute,” Dr. Berry explained. “If it could fully replace traditional tests, I’d be on board, but the evidence just isn’t there yet.”&lt;br data-node-id="28.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Kazanjian adds that whole-body MRI “tends to be more effective at detecting lesions in the kidneys, pancreas, lymph nodes, and bones, among some others,” but that the screening’s ability to characterize them as benign or malignant may be limited. She adds that whole-body MRI does not effectively screen for some of the most common cancers, including skin cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, and cervical cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And while there will certainly be “findings of import on these exams,” including brain aneurysms, evidence of autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndromes, and small cancers, among others, Dr. Kazanjian explains, it’s impossible to say whether whole-body MRI truly leads to improved health outcomes or whether those results would be uncovered via traditional screening methods. There’s also the aspect of incidental or benign findings, which are clinically insignificant (meaning they cause no harm), but create a type of “scanxiety,” or anxiety felt by patients pre- and post-scan, Dr. Kazanjian says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;My Enhanced Screening at the Manhattan location has a cost of $4,500, but it varies based on the exact scan you choose, and sometimes, the location. There are less costly options, like the regular whole-body MRI ($2,500) or the torso-only MRI ($999). Prenuvo also offers its &lt;a href="https://prenuvo.com/warriors-program" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://prenuvo.com/warriors-program" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Warriors Program" data-node-id="32.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Warriors Program&lt;/a&gt;, which offers discounted services to first responders, military members, and veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While some doctors, like Dr. Kazanjian, &lt;em data-node-id="33.1"&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; recommend whole-body MRI for high-risk individuals (like those with a strong family history of cancer and/or genetic mutations) and for patients with cancers such as &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a45126444/this-is-what-its-like-to-live-with-multiple-myeloma/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a45126444/this-is-what-its-like-to-live-with-multiple-myeloma/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="multiple myeloma" data-node-id="33.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;multiple myeloma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a65530439/classic-hodgkin-lymphoma-symptoms/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a65530439/classic-hodgkin-lymphoma-symptoms/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lymphoma" data-node-id="33.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;lymphoma&lt;/a&gt;, it is generally not recommended for the general population, she explains. “I do not think this is cost-effective for the population, particularly given the large percentage of false positives with the necessity for costly follow-ups,” says Dr. Kazanjian. “I say this even if the initial service were cost-free.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Durand also acknowledges that not everybody can afford the Prenuvo model of healthcare today. That’s why he says Prenuvo is working every day to harness the powers of artificial intelligence to become more efficient, which will allow them to bring prices down long-term.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In terms of side effects, MRI, including whole-body MRI, is mostly safe. The “scanxiety” and inconsequential benign findings that Dr. Kazanjian points out are the main downsides. As with &lt;em data-node-id="35.1"&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; MRI, it’s important to tell your doctor and radiologist if you have any &lt;strong data-node-id="35.3"&gt;metal or electrical implants &lt;/strong&gt;in your body (such as pacemakers and infusion pumps), as the magnetic field generated by the MRI machine &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551669/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551669/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="can pose a hazard to patients in these cases" data-node-id="35.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;can pose a hazard to patients in these cases&lt;/a&gt;. The detailed questionnaire sent over by the Prenuvo team before your appointment covers these in length, and your radiologist will also inquire about any metal in or on your body before your scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“These scans have potential and may help in the future, but right now they’re best for people with high risk or specific concerns or a lot of disposable income,” Dr. Berry explains. “For the average person, they often create more questions than answers. Too much testing can lead to fear, cost, and harm, especially when there’s no clear benefit. Prevention and early detection are very important, but it has to be reasonable and relevant, not just expensive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Reflecting on my experience with the whole-body MRI at Prenuvo, I feel fortunate to have had access to such advanced technology. The scan provided valuable insights into my body’s health that I wouldn’t have otherwise had. However, while I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to those who have the resources and are curious about their health, I do believe it’s important to approach it with a balanced perspective. From a cost-benefit standpoint, it’s not yet a universally essential tool in healthcare, and its value largely depends on individual circumstances and priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“The best advice I can give to the people reading this is the advice I live by and the advice I give my patients. This is the same advice I give my mother—and I love my mother. It’s to live a healthy life—keep a healthy weight, eat whole grains and vegetables and lean protein, exercise regularly, sleep seven hours a night, avoid tobacco and alcohol, and get annual checkups, recommended screenings, and vaccines with your doctor,” Dr. Kazanjian says. “Prevention is the best medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 12:32:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBVVkg0X1NIU09vU0xTTW9MNGFCSXZzNWgxTmk1YWtFT0MySnlMVkhIcUJiZnFKa1VEQzM0MXZ5U2tjcjlqamtWMU12Mk5lNkhRNEx6S3VoRXFwdVF3a2xDQmE0UFVjMTc4VnJfc2c5dUlybkY2OE84cXZvTG9tRnc</guid></item><item><title>我赚了六位数的薪水，跑了马拉松，过着奢侈的生活-但我否认我的酗酒习惯......我是一个“酗酒者” -每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNdTdQU0pDdjZiNm5LM21hcGdvcVNjNUEzU1hNTkFDUXNyQzF2Mzg3TGxlSHc3bHh0TnUzYjZ2S05yTFl6Sk5hLTVLOXlScGlONXR0d1R2ZWgwOU5tMzFycGRyWHlLWDFaSkVGWWhHSk1EZ2NYYzRfUWxQbnNoN0RNTUR3V0xLMXJ1RHg5aFB2NTR1NWk1SDNMcGJ30gGfAUFVX3lxTE5yTHhRYU5LRlAxdzZsWE5nZXdwSXk4bzJQTWNTU1dUNDZOTzJPQmw4MG9jdmgtOXlHeDB0ZmdUX3lYdlRNTlcxT2xiUHo0eU9RY1Y2UVg4bU1mX0ZtWWpnbWpXSE5veVl2bkd1dVNVRzd1czFYalVVOWRlZE1BcHVGemozRFJVbkZjQ0QyOXpJckRwUGJ6MF9hbDhXeTJqTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A woman who was earning a six-figure salary and enjoying considerable success in her career has opened up about her battle with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-316bad40-72b6-11f0-a220-df039e5e8fdc" class=""&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; - and the extent to which she kept it hidden from those around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra Parker, 56, who hails from Scotland and now lives in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-31759850-72b6-11f0-a220-df039e5e8fdc"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, is a certified alcohol coach and founder of Just the Tonic. Now, her alcohol-free life is a far cry from her old approach to drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra began drinking started when she went to university at the age of 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she had tried alcohol a few times before, it was during her student days that she started drinking more regularly, and in increasing quantities, Sandra told FEMAIL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This time also saw a social shift taking place, one that would have a significant impact on the drinking habits of many - including Sandra. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The foundation of what would become an addition was laid against the backdrop of the rise of ladette culture, which saw young women rebel against societal expectations that confined them to roles that were demure by embracing more masculine behaviours like swearing, partying, and drinking heavily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Sandra, the new trend was very different to how older women, like those from her mother’s generation, had been expected to behave, and it was ‘fun’ to try and keep up with the lads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her drink of choice at university was a half pint of cider with a large blackcurrant top to hide the taste of the alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sandra Parker (pictured) would drink to excess, then feel awful about it when waking up after a big night out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she graduated and moved to London, and lived in a house share with three other women, they used to drink an alcopop called Hooch, which they bought from the Waitrose across the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If you bought a certain number of bottles,’ she said, ‘they would give you a free glass, which we all thought was really cool.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also dipped into a cider called Diamond White that a friend introduced her to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Describing an advert for the beverage, Sandra said: ‘There was a picture of two girls [who seemed drunk] and one of them was carting the other one around in a shopping trolley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The slogan said they were having “a diamond night out”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think nowadays, that would have been seen as really quite shocking. But at the time, it was all a bit of a laugh.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her career, meanwhile, was going well - after moving down to London, she had got a job at an investment bank in Canary Wharf. Going from university to office, her environment had changed - but the drinking remained a constant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: ‘There was very much that sort of work hard, play hard culture, going out for drinks a couple of nights a week. If you got drunk, there was sort of a badge of honour when you went into work the next day.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The popularity of 'ladette' culture, where young women would embrace traditionally masculine behaviours, like drinking to excess, played into Sandra  (pictured) drinking a lot at university then work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra continued: ‘I had a manager, and if we were going for a night out, and someone asked whether we were going for something to eat, he would say “eating is cheating”.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I don’t think people would get away with that now, but then, it was very much like you had to prove yourself, and be able to hold your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I’m not very tall, I’m about 5’3” and about eight stone, so many of the guys were much bigger than me, and there weren’t many women working there. Because it was a career thing, you felt like you were quite sophisticated, but it was still very heavy drinking.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from the booze-fuelled weekday evenings, Sandra live a healthy life; she would eat well and go running - even taking part in several half marathons as well as two full marathons (she ran one of them after drinking the night before).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think the weekend running was a good way for me to de-stress. I was never particularly sporty at school, but I had quite good stamina for running, and I quite enjoyed it,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think that was also part of drinking culture as well, because, like, I was in a running club, and it was seen as a badge of honour that you finished a run, and you had a few drinks.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that she would sometimes follow eating plans, or exercise regimes, but while she would stick to everything the plan recommended, she would ignore anything about giving up alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra explained: ‘As I was getting older, I was interested in feeling healthier, but alcohol was a bit of a blind spot. And I didn't realise how much it had a grip over me. I thought I was being quite clever by ignoring the alcohol part and focusing on the other parts [of a healthy eating and exercise regime].’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After enjoying cider and blackcurrant, and alcopops in her early twenties, as she grew older, Sandra started drinking expensive wine, and tell herself that her drinking was sophisticated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As she continued to succeed at work, with regular promotions and a six-figure salary to boot, she traded in alcopops and cider for something stronger - and more sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There's a place in London called The Wine and Spirit Education Trust,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I did a wine tasting course there, and I'd been to Sonoma Valley, and had a friend who was a real wine connoisseur. I used to go out with him, and a crowd of others, and we would pretend that we were really sophisticated.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she added, while she said she only drank ‘really good quality wine’, if she went on holiday, she would drink whatever was available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra explained: ‘If I look back, I just wanted the hit from the alcohol.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were times when she would be concerned how much she was drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘From time to time, I would wake up and I would feel absolutely horrendous,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I would never go out and plan to get drunk, but there would be times I would wake up and wouldn't quite remember the night before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alcohol was a major source of enjoyment for Sandra (pictured) whether on nights out, or on holiday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I would have described myself as an anxious person, and I used to have panic attacks when I was a student, and I would get this horrendous anxiety the [day after getting drunk], and when I felt like that, I always wanted to learn how to control alcohol.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘I never really wanted to get drunk, but at no point did I ever, ever consider giving up. And what happened was, as I was getting older, I think the hangovers were affecting me worse, and I noticed my moods were affected too: I was getting really down and I remember deciding to try harder to moderate my drinking as I still didn’t want to give up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The thought for me, of not drinking was horrific. To be honest, I thought I would be incredibly miserable, and it sounds like odd now, but I just thought there wouldn't be any point in life if I couldn't drink alcohol. So [giving up] was never, ever something I wanted to do.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘I was really good at convincing myself that feeling that way was normal. I know it sounds ridiculous now, but when I look back, I deliberately avoided people, say at work, who didn’t drink. I think there was a part of me that thought “they’re not any fun”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I would try and find ways to convince myself that my attitude to drinking was healthy and that people who didn't drink just didn't know how to enjoy themselves. So I think I did recognise that it was a bit of a problem, but at the same time, it wasn't something that I was that constantly aware of.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On what the people around her thought about her drinking, Sandra said she tried to dismiss it as a serious issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It wasn't like I was getting drunk every night and falling over. But let's say that after work, I got really drunk,' she said. ‘The people I socialised with at the weekend didn't really know. I also tried hard to pretend that I didn't feel that bad the next day. So from time to time, people would say, “you're drinking a bit too much”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But there were ways where I was probably hiding it...If people said, “oh, you got really drunk last night,” I would say that I had felt fine. I would never, ever admit it. I would feel embarrassed.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sandra (pictured) got to a point where she was being a bit deceptive about how much alcohol she was consuming&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Sandra got to a point where she knew she ‘needed to get control’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She decided to follow a Dry January-style programme, ditching alcohol for a month, but throughout that time, she was planning to return to drinking once the designated time period was over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra explained: ‘I was really sick of hangovers. At the time, I was working with a really good life coach, and had been doing a lot of work on my mindset.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Abstaining from the drink, Sandra started to feel better, and started to think that she should try to stay away from alcohol for longer. She said: ’My plan was to be alcohol-free for six months and then a year. But I still really wanted to moderate [my alcohol intake] after that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after she’d abstained for around six months, one of her friends said to her: ‘I can't wait to go out, to go out with you after the year's up. ‘&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra said: ‘I turned around her and I said, “I don't think I'm going to go back to drinking”. When I said it out loud, I was quite shocked, because I hadn't really thought about it. But I thought, “Why would I go back?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think part of me was worried that I wouldn't be able to moderate, but the other part of me couldn't deny that I was happier. I was like, surprised - I was quite shocked, really, to be honest. But I thought, “Look, you wanted to moderate, but like, let's be honest, you're a lot happier now, so why not just keep going?”.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That was seven years ago, and Sandra hasn’t drunk alcohol since - which led to another major life change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sandra (pictured) hadn't planned to leave her job and become a full-time coach, but things changed after Covid, so she decided to go for it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In the job that I was doing, I managed people, and I had always enjoyed doing that. I had trained to become a coach, and I was thinking that coaching is something I may do part-time after retiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It had given me the chance to train to help people to get control over alcohol, which is something I was really fascinated by.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And then the pandemic happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Covid was like a big shift,’ said Sandra, 'because I could see how many people were struggling, people’s alcohol intake just seemed to shoot up. At the same time, the company I worked for gave us the opportunity to take redundancy. So, I had learned how to become a coach. I could see all these people were struggling, and I thought, “Why not?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I'd never planned to do this full time, but it just felt like the right thing to do. If I'd spoken to you 10 years and you said I was drinking, I would have thought “you've got me mixed up with somebody else”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If you told me that I was going to be helping other people stop drinking, I would have been really shocked.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite being such a major change, leaving her old job to embark on a career as a certified alcohol coach was such a major change, but as Sandra says, ‘felt like the right thing to do’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The people she works with come to her, which means they have identified that their drinking is an issue, and are in the mindset of wanting to stop. Sandra added: ‘The people I work with are pretty high-achieving, and they're not at rock bottom.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Describing her typical clients, she said they had 'high standards' for themselves, were usually over-45, and beginning to worry that heavy drinking might be impacting their health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Or sometimes they're just realising that for their job, the mental clarity that they need, they're not going to be able to maintain it,' she continued. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because the people Sandra works with are successful, it is often easier for them to hide their drinking behind upmarket activities - like expensive wine tastings. Sandra added: ‘There are clients I have worked with who have had wine fridges, who have been really into wine tasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And there’s definitely a demographic where people are able to kind of fool themselves because they’ll say, “I never touch spirits, or I never drink before six o'clock, or I only drink quality red wine”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And there are so many ways that when we do that, we can tell ourselves that alcohol is just a harmless, sophisticated indulgence. But the reality is, it doesn't actually matter what type of alcohol it is.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She noted that when people start to get defensive about their drinking, or try and justify it, there is ‘probably something there’, that needs further looking at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it comes to the best way to tackle problem drinking, Sandra said: ‘I think some people worry about whether they are an alcoholic. And I think what's good to know is that the doctors don't use that term anymore, so they would talk about Alcohol Use Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So when I'm speaking to people, what I tend to ask is, “Are you drinking more than you want?”. I think that's the first question to ask, because then the amount becomes a bit irrelevant, and it's about whether the person is regularly drinking more than they want.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Now, some seven years after ditching alcohol, Sandra (pictured) wants people to know that there is a different way to approach quitting &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; If they reply affirmatively, she continued, Sandra asks them: 'What would it feel like right now if someone said to you, "Don't drink for a week or a month?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For most people, if they don't have any problem with alcohol, that shouldn't be an issue, she continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But if you suddenly thought of all the reasons why you wouldn't be able to give up for a week or a month, then that's a sign that is taking a bit of a hold,' Sandra explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her best advice for people trying to control their drinking is simply to be honest with themselves and 'not to try and normalise' the habit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra added that she recommends people cut their drinking down over a period of time, and while doing so, they may notice why they’ve been drinking, and what they are trying to numb by drinking to excess - whether that is work stress, boredom, or something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is still a stigma around alcohol misuse, according to Sandra, who said one of the things clients often say to her is that she is the first person they’ve spoken to about their drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; She added that it is ‘incredibly rewarding’ when people give up alcohol, and you see them go from struggling to seeing their confidence and quality of life surge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people who are struggling with drinking, Sandra said: ‘If people have tried to cut down before, and have framed it as being really hard, and making them miserable, then there is a different way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I focus on helping people change their mindset, because if you're not bothered about alcohol, then you don't feel deprived. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There's definitely a way that we can look at the different reasons why people are stuck, and we can change those beliefs. And if you change those beliefs and you don't want to drink, you're going to be so much happier than trying and failing with willpower. If somebody had told me that 20 years ago, I would have been delighted.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 12:31:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNdTdQU0pDdjZiNm5LM21hcGdvcVNjNUEzU1hNTkFDUXNyQzF2Mzg3TGxlSHc3bHh0TnUzYjZ2S05yTFl6Sk5hLTVLOXlScGlONXR0d1R2ZWgwOU5tMzFycGRyWHlLWDFaSkVGWWhHSk1EZ2NYYzRfUWxQbnNoN0RNTUR3V0xLMXJ1RHg5aFB2NTR1NWk1SDNMcGJ30gGfAUFVX3lxTE5yTHhRYU5LRlAxdzZsWE5nZXdwSXk4bzJQTWNTU1dUNDZOTzJPQmw4MG9jdmgtOXlHeDB0ZmdUX3lYdlRNTlcxT2xiUHo0eU9RY1Y2UVg4bU1mX0ZtWWpnbWpXSE5veVl2bkd1dVNVRzd1czFYalVVOWRlZE1BcHVGemozRFJVbkZjQ0QyOXpJckRwUGJ6MF9hbDhXeTJqTQ</guid></item><item><title>双胞胎使用酮症，步行，手术减掉近400磅- TODAY.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQN0dTZGdkajJTSEM1dFVYM29feGNwdm5GaDVDSlhpdG9qNzJpbHdsMzh3SmhrUFNQS01KUmNUek5oT0tBOERmX2lwOWJUTXh4T1BBbGgwblRDZW9zSDFqVGZOdWtrSnVreERpc2ltY3paSjdrVk81NXRfaWkyMHMzRE1ZZFl4a3Jq0gFUQVVfeXFMTXJkZFlvYmxaSnVFRjlpUWRyZVJzQ0U2TDg0YXZyTHFJMW44S29Vc1FCT1Vla1czZnZyRUpGWmdfdHhaaGdhYUNnVmFneS1IeE55OVlw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f7f92d" class="body-graf"&gt;When Tonia Brown’s weight reached 380 pounds, she was frustrated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3f3f5d" class="body-graf"&gt;“I was getting tired of it. I wanted to lose some weight,” the 51-year-old from Shelby, North Carolina, tells TODAY.com. “I wanted to start taking better care of myself because I was getting older and starting to feel it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-32b9f4" class="body-graf"&gt;About eight years ago, Brown started eating a ketogenic diet and walking around the house. When her twin sister Tonie Ervin noticed Brown losing weight, Ervin examined her own habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-64d1f0" class="body-graf"&gt;“I realized that I was going to become the fatter twin,” Ervin, 51, of Shelby, North Carolina, tells TODAY.com. “(I) started doing keto and exercising because she made me.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2e4b6c" class="body-graf"&gt;In total, the two have shed nearly 400 pounds with keto, exercise and bariatric surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-754a6e" class="body-graf"&gt;“It really, really helps to have Sister with me doing it because I don’t know if I could have done this myself,” Brown says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3d7c5e" class="body-heading"&gt;A Focus on Diet and Moving Their Bodies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-96da0b" class="body-graf"&gt;After Brown began exercising more and eating a different diet, she started shedding some weight. That’s when Ervin, who weighed about 400 pounds, approached her sister. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3500d0" class="body-graf"&gt;“After about 50 pounds or so, she pulled me aside at one of our events for church and said, ‘Hey, I don’t know what you’re doing, but I really don’t want to be the fatter twin.

But then their progress stalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-520d90" class="body-graf"&gt;“We hit a wall,” Brown says. “You get older, that’s what happens. And after about two years or so of hitting a wall and not losing any weight, we plateaued really badly.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-38f23a" class="body-graf"&gt;Still not happy with their weight, the twins discussed bariatric surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-055a4f" class="body-graf"&gt;“Once we started discussing it with the doctor, we jumped right into it,” Brown says. “What happened was I went to Sister and said, ‘I’m having bariatric surgery.’ (And she said) ‘Oh, we’re having bariatric surgery.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1afab4" class="body-graf"&gt;The two — who “are probably together more than anybody really has any right to be,” Brown says — met with the bariatric surgeon for a consult at the same time. But he set boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-80cbd8" class="body-graf"&gt;“When he realized we were twins, he came in and said immediately when he saw us together … ‘No, I can’t see them together. They have to split up,’” Brown says. “We don’t blame him. It’s a lot of information to mix up.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-504007" class="body-graf"&gt;Ervin underwent surgery first in late November of 2023, and Brown had her surgery about a week later. The two experienced very different recoveries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4417ee" class="body-graf"&gt;“Mine was pretty breezy,” Ervin says. “I wanted to immediately go home, and I was a little fussy about (staying the night).

Brown could drink enough water to “pop” the blood plug, or they’d have to go in with an endoscope and break up the plug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da86d4" class="body-graf"&gt;“I did not want to go under anesthesia again,” Brown explains. “I started hammering water, and about two hours later, it stopped coming back up.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-686128" class="body-graf"&gt;Even with the complication, Brown doesn’t want to dissuade people from having the surgery if they think it’s the right choice for them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-847e48" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s something you need to be aware of,” she says. “But don’t let that flavor your experience … Honestly, I would do that again even if I knew that was on the docket.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-26fe34" class="body-graf"&gt;After their surgeries, the twins started losing weight again very quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b895a" class="body-graf"&gt;“You’re dropping 10 pounds this week and another 10 pounds that week and five pounds this week,” Brown says. “We came out of clothes so fast.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-45e176" class="body-graf"&gt;Their diets have also changed since surgery. They now focus more on eating protein and add fruits and vegetables to their meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-afe81a" class="body-graf"&gt;“When you do keto, it’s a lot more fat-focused,” Ervin says. “When you do the bariatric, you don’t want to focus on that fat.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ab8c8" class="body-graf"&gt;Eating too much fat after surgery can cause the food to move quickly through the GI tract and can be “very unpleasant when it happens,” she adds. As they have tweaked their diets, their exercise continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d9ab0e" class="body-graf"&gt;“We both walk,” Brown says. “At 50 it’s hard, but you get it done.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9aad4b" class="body-graf"&gt;Brown weighs about 166 pounds now, and Ervin weighs about 223 pounds.

These include heightened awareness about Legionnaires’ — a severe form of pneumonia — as well as climate change and ongoing issues with buildings’ water systems. To get Legionnaires’, a person has to inhale mist or aspirate water containing a bacteria known as Legionella, which often grows in plumbing systems or water-cooling towers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8rsss"&gt;New York isn’t the only place in the country that has battled outbreaks, but the state has emerged as an outlier. The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5466019/#:~:text=The%20outbreak%20was%20officially%20declared,LD%20outbreak%20in%20NYC%20history." rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;worst outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in New York City history occurred in the South Bronx in 2015, infecting more than 130 people and causing 16 deaths. That led both the city and state to implement what experts say are strong regulations for preventing the growth of Legionella in buildings' water systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="17hje"&gt;But hundreds of cases are still reported by the city health department each year. Last year, 257 New Yorkers were diagnosed with Legionnaires’, according to preliminary numbers from the city health department. In 2018, the number topped 650. Outbreaks over the past decade have also resulted in additional deaths, including those of five people &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/12/nyregion/nyc-legionnaires-nursing-home.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in an outbreak&lt;/a&gt; at a nursing home in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="c1st2"&gt;The number of Legionnaires’ cases reported annually in the United States has increased dramatically since 2000. New York and some other states in the Northeast have particularly high case rates, whereas Legionnaires’ is practically unheard of on the West Coast, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/php/surveillance/surveillance-report-2018-2019.html#figure-3b" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to data&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="32p77"&gt;Within New York City, high-poverty neighborhoods where underlying health issues like asthma are generally higher are also disproportionately affected by Legionnaires’, city data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="1s6qj"&gt;Sickened in an earlier outbreak&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bubed"&gt;When Anita Long got sick with Legionnaires’ disease in 2022, she had lived in the Bronx for more than 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="4boj5"&gt;“I loved my area,” said Long, now 68, who was once a member of Bronx Community Board 4 and a tenants’ rights activist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1l6br"&gt;But after complications from Legionnaires’ landed her in the hospital for 22 days, Long said, she didn’t want to go outside anymore for fear of getting sick again. Medical experts say infections typically occur when people inhale bacteria-laden water droplets or vapors when they are outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="97u7n"&gt;“ This was one of the reasons why I left and moved to Connecticut,” Long said, adding that she worried the owners of buildings in the area weren’t properly maintaining their cooling towers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1kfqd"&gt;Increased awareness of the disease within the medical community is one factor likely contributing to more diagnoses in recent years, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cv7i2"&gt;“Physicians have a higher ‘index of suspicion,’ so they think about Legionnaires’ disease when they see a patient with pneumonia,” said Janet Stout, an infectious disease microbiologist at the University of Pittsburgh and president of Special Pathogens Technology, a company that seeks to prevent Legionnaires’ disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="eo5a6"&gt;In New York City, the health department helps keep Legionnaires’ on doctors’ radar. A notice sent to health care providers on July 1 &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/han/advisory/2025/han-advisory-14-legionella.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reminded&lt;/a&gt; them that New York state “has a high burden of legionellosis, with increased incidence during the summer and early fall.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="1hbp2"&gt;Rising temperatures and other theories&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1lknp"&gt;Legionella bacteria also thrive in warm water and researchers said rising temperatures are likely contributing to the increase in cases in recent decades. Stout said parts of the country that have more humidity and less sunshine are particularly hospitable to Legionella, especially in the summertime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="f8fnh"&gt;Within New York state, there are also particular conditions that may help Legionella thrive, such as aging infrastructure and the high level of sediment in the water, which “ can be a food source” for the bacteria, said David Pierre, director of water safety programs at LiquiTech, a company that offers water treatment solutions with a focus on Legionella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5ubbj"&gt;Researchers are still coming up with new theories as to why Legionnaires’ disease has become so much more common over the past couple of decades. A University of Albany study published last year suggested one culprit might be the successful effort in recent decades to &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/power-sector/progress-report-emissions-reductions#so2" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lower the levels of the sulfur dioxide&lt;/a&gt; in the air, which is typically seen as a win for human and animal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="84uoq"&gt;Less sulfur dioxide makes the air less acidic, which allows Legionella bacteria to survive longer, said Fangqun Yu, a senior researcher at the University of Albany’s Atmospheric Sciences Research Center and one of the authors of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="52hob"&gt;“ We think that air quality improvement is very good,” Yu clarified, but said this could be a potential negative side effect that has to be mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="e3ed8"&gt;Stout said it was an interesting finding that needs to be studied further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="euhgs"&gt;Experts said the population density in New York City means that when a water cooling tower emits Legionella into the air, more people are likely to be exposed to it. But not everyone who’s exposed gets sick and the demographics of the people living in the area matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="586j0"&gt;Most of the people who get diagnosed with Legionnaires’ in New York City &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/databrief106.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;have at least one characteristic&lt;/a&gt; that puts them at higher risk for the disease, such as being over 50, being a smoker or having a chronic lung disease, according to the city health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="kall"&gt;Still a preventable disease&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2h8io"&gt;But despite all these factors, experts emphasized that Legionnaires’ disease is largely preventable if building owners take the proper steps to test for and mitigate Legionella. And, they said, if followed properly, New York City and state protocols should be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8d71h"&gt;“ New York State and New York City have really done far more than most states and cities to address prevention of Legionnaire's disease,” Stout said. “Yet, despite that, outbreaks still occur, mostly because of the human factor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5al5h"&gt;New York state law &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/water/drinking/legionella/hospitals_health_care.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;requires&lt;/a&gt; hospitals and residential health care facilities to establish a sampling and management plan to control Legionella in their potable water systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="e50de"&gt;Under a &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/ll77of2015.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;New York City law&lt;/a&gt; passed in 2015, all building owners must also register their water cooling towers with the city. They have to put in place a maintenance plan to prevent and control the growth of Legionella and inspect and test the towers at least every three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9ksl8"&gt;The city can also conduct its own inspections and those who violate the law could face fines or misdemeanor charges. City protocols for building owners are based on a national standard developed by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8r4kt"&gt;But public data shows city inspections of cooling towers have &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/legionnaires-inspections-sank-to-near-record-low-ahead-of-nyc-outbreak" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dropped off precipitously&lt;/a&gt; since the law was enacted. Asked about the decline last week, the city health department attributed it to a staffing shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6snbu"&gt;Pierre also said some building owners do “the bare minimum” to comply with the laws, which can amount to box-checking rather than proper maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="4ofl3"&gt;City health officials say they have taken aggressive measures to stop the outbreak in Harlem. They said they have screened all water cooling towers in the affected area for Legionella and conducted remediation efforts at 11 buildings that tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="mg6a"&gt;The officials have not said definitively whether those positive tests are linked to the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 12:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNdUFsNC13b0RreWxfakRfMDVOWGlyVDYxYXNHWVlCMnNtYzltX3ZMS21ubGwzQXFCOFpLdE1vRnZHbGQzOFBTU3VxcUZ6N3VaZzl4Tk90Q3otNktuLWZCRENDa0c2ZzZkbkhtUjVEX0cyWDhPa1JfSXZjallwNi1Ea0dpTkpDRnNHc1JxMS1ZTkJnYkdQRVJ3dmdiX2o3TkZtSERQYk1iOE9jWGRIT3hsQQ</guid></item><item><title>帕金森氏症：骑自行车可能有助于缓解运动症状-今日医学新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixgFBVV95cUxOU0JGMnExLUxmQzg3RlBlNTU0c0JROEFRY3k5M1kwdjdPSzlLeWRJSExOSktpeTBsOGtLR3FDRzMxX2g0cXVjZkNzbkJpZmxWZEhrNUEyZm5oay1sMDVDOWRuMkRSdHI0Q1RlRVFibFpYWDVub0hFNEVrNEVDTDhieHpxUDJUd0QtMW1nOV9pdDlvbmZfRVNQUVpwYVh0eERDS2pzcHdXU0hVNUlXYUt4WHlUYW95czBtdzlyUFpRRzdfdTZySlE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/senior-couple-fixing-bike-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/senior-couple-fixing-bike-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/senior-couple-fixing-bike-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/senior-couple-fixing-bike-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg" alt="An older adult couple fixing a bicycle outside" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fcycling-may-help-restore-neural-connections-damaged-parkinsons-disease-brain-function&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F08%2Fsenior-couple-fixing-bike-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Parkinson's%3A%20Cycling%20may%20help%20relieve%20motor%20symptoms" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/senior-couple-fixing-bike-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;Scientists have found that cycling may have beneficial effects on Parkinson’s disease.

When a degenerative condition like Parkinson’s is introduced, it adds layers of complexity and nonlinear disruptions to brain function,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shaikh is the lead author of a new study recently published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1388245725004341?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clinical Neurophysiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that found cycling helps restore neural connections damaged by Parkinson’s disease. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers recruited nine adult participants with Parkinson’s disease to undergo 12 cycling sessions over a four-week period. All participants had &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/deep-brain-stimulation-parkinsons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;deep brain stimulation (DBS)&lt;/a&gt; devices that had already been implanted before the start of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study … leveraged DBS for its unique ability to record neural activity in the brain regions surrounding the stimulation lead,” Shaikh said. “Using this capability, the researchers examined how exercise influences and potentially rewires brain function.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists utilized an adaptive cycling program where over time, the bike “learned” how each participant performed while biking. For example, while a game screen allowed participants to know their pedaling intensity, the bike would add or remove resistance depending on each rider’s effort level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, Shaikh and his team found that after 12 cycling sessions, study participants demonstrated a measurable change in the brain signals involved with both motor control and movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding provided proof of principle that exercise changes the brain. It further informed us that change only happens when exercise is done persistently, consistently, and over (a) long period of time. From the mechanistic standpoint it told us that drivers of such change may reside outside of &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537141/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;basal ganglia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; — the key structure involved in Parkinson’s disease.” &lt;br&gt;— Aasef Shaikh MD, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(The) main takeaway from the patients’ perspective is that one has to keep (an) active lifestyle, constantly doing physical ‘exercise’ to keep up with Parkinson’s disease,” Shaikh explained. “Analogous to this is doing ‘mental exercise’ — which will help one stay mentally healthy and cognitively healthy. The take away from scientific and mechanistic standpoint is that exercise induced change (plasticity) happens, but the driver is outside of the basal ganglia. We have yet to determine that driver, but it could very well be (the) &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8411041/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;proprioceptive system&lt;/a&gt; and/or the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/313265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;cerebellum&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would like to broaden this mechanistic investigation with more imaging and structure to function correlation tool sets available to us,” Shaikh added. “We would also like to expand the effort, disseminating bike technology in multicenter trials. We would like to explore whether other exercise modalities have similar benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/20986/daniel-daneshvar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Daniel H. Daneshvar, MD, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, chief of Brain Injury Rehabilitation at Mass General Brigham and associate professor at Harvard Medical School, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daneshvar commented that this was an encouraging and creative study that answers a critical question: to what extent does exercise result in actual changes in the brain in patients with Parkinson’s disease? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a robust body of literature that shows that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6238554/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; is the best intervention for individuals with Parkinson’s disease, and I often tell my patients that if there were a pill that worked as well as exercise for Parkinson’s disease, it’d be a billion dollar pill. However, we don’t have a complete understanding of how exercise works on the brain.” &lt;br&gt;— Daniel H. Daneshvar, MD, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For patients, this is promising evidence that exercise can help re-engage parts of the brain affected by Parkinson’s disease,” Daneshvar continued. “That alignment between a practical therapy and circuit-level readouts is what makes this noteworthy for clinicians counseling patients about why exercise works so well, and is so important, for patients with Parkinson’s disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://baptisthealth.net/doctors/samer-darwish-tabbal/3097422" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Samer Tabbal, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist and director of the movement disorders program at Baptist Health Miami Neuroscience Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida, about this research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The motor benefit of exercise on patients with Parkinson’s disease was demonstrated in multiple previous studies,” Tabbal commented. “This study is a good attempt to explain how exercise provides such motor benefits by demonstrating how exercise changes the behavior of cells even in a damaged brain. The ability of the behavior of brain cells to change, including forming new connections, is referred to as &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557811/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Of interest is the finding that dynamic cycling had no significant immediate effects on the outcome measures, but had definite long-term effects,” he continued. “This may suggest that the benefit of exercise is a long-term goal and that patients should exercise with a long-term hope without expecting immediate benefits. This reminds me very much of how a long-term social relationship builds a solid, healthy friendship.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tabbal said that knowledge is power, defined as the ability to change, and the more we know about how exercise improves brain function, the better we will be able to use exercise effectively to improve the symptoms of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the longer term, if we know how exercise improves brain function, we could find other means of achieving the same or even better benefit through other means, such as using medication, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/electrical-muscle-stimulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;electric stimulation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;magnetic stimulation&lt;/a&gt;, music, or light therapy,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 11:48:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixgFBVV95cUxOU0JGMnExLUxmQzg3RlBlNTU0c0JROEFRY3k5M1kwdjdPSzlLeWRJSExOSktpeTBsOGtLR3FDRzMxX2g0cXVjZkNzbkJpZmxWZEhrNUEyZm5oay1sMDVDOWRuMkRSdHI0Q1RlRVFibFpYWDVub0hFNEVrNEVDTDhieHpxUDJUd0QtMW1nOV9pdDlvbmZfRVNQUVpwYVh0eERDS2pzcHdXU0hVNUlXYUt4WHlUYW95czBtdzlyUFpRRzdfdTZySlE</guid></item><item><title>研究显示，每周只吃3份薯条会使患糖尿病的风险增加20% - Notebookcheck</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxQWmtKWVVJTDJoVkNZMmNKLTZoUFhiSExXY1ZZaHVvWmtCdll2SXdoQmhrbDFnWE10SVhCZ25rNy03aTdUd2pPX1BPcW1PYzJwYi1rcExoUjVzY0h2LThlcDQ2QjJuaXBkNU4tcVZWcUFyM25Hdjh1X2czdkZqTEZLZEMwZTdGYU45Y3ppQTNyUjhILTg3eFl6TDBEcmhoRmgwdUtpTHNGbkFQZFhTQmtMT2NyNWRFRTUtZ0xKWTZub2ZrbDZCcXM4TnpEZmtqYS1BckVV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="content"&gt;&lt;div id="c14080755" class="ttcl_0 csc-default"&gt;

	&lt;p class="bodytext"&gt;According to a new study, the method of preparation is a major factor in the link between potato consumption and type 2 diabetes. The research showed that for every three weekly servings of french fries, the chance of developing the disease increased by 20%. In contrast, the study found that a similar consumption rate of baked, mashed, or boiled potatoes didn't give the same result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="bodytext"&gt;The findings were based on the long-term analysis of three major U.S. studies that spanned about 40 years, involving more than 205,000 health professionals. The research team also carried out a meta-analysis of 13 studies involving over 587,000 people, which further solidified their conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="bodytext"&gt;While potatoes are known to contain beneficial nutrients like fiber and vitamin C, they also have high starch content, earning them a high glycemic index — a long-standing concern for diabetes risk. The study also found that replacing french fries with whole grains resulted in a 19% lower risk of developing diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="bodytext"&gt;The researchers note that this is only an observational study and does not prove direct cause and effect, hence more extensive and inclusive studies will be needed to arrive at a solidified conclusion. However, the results highlight a strong connection between french fries and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person" rel="author" class="nbc_rightbox journalist_bottom"&gt;&lt;div class="j_author"&gt;&lt;a href="Notebookcheck-Team.212978.0.html?&amp;amp;tx_nbc2journalist_pi1%5Bmode%5D=show&amp;amp;tx_nbc2journalist_pi1%5Buid%5D=369" class="j_name"&gt;Chibuike Okpara&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Tech Writer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span title="109 "&gt; - 109 articles published on Notebookcheck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; since 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="j_abstract"&gt;I have always been fascinated by technology and digital devices my entire life and even got addicted to it. I have always marveled at the intricacy of even the simplest digital devices and systems around us. I have been writing and publishing articles online for about 6 years now, just about a year ago, I found myself lost in the marvel of smartphones and laptops we have in our hands every day. I developed a passion for learning about new devices and technologies that come with them and at some point, I asked myself, "Why not get into writing tech articles?" It is useless to say I followed up the idea — it is evident. I am an open-minded individual who derives an infinite amount of joy from researching and discovering new information, I believe there is so much to learn and such a short life to live, so I put my time to good use — learning new things. I am a 'bookworm' of the internet and digital devices. When I am not writing, you will find me on my devices still, I do explore and admire the beauty of nature and creatures.

The last major sunscreen monograph proposal came in 1999.

Some people, frustrated by the lack of innovation, are turning to imported products or homemade solutions, which Friedman strongly discourages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HKH7L2HFKBA3LMVJPYG6FOM26Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Would you make Tylenol or Advil in your bathtub?” Friedman said. “There’s no way to replicate the safety, testing and effectiveness of a professionally formulated sunscreen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CCIKQHVH35DMPKIWVHF2ACEELA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Other countries often approve sunscreen filters faster by following a different regulatory model that emphasizes post-market surveillance and international data. The European Commission evaluates sunscreen ingredients under a cosmetics framework that allows newer filters to reach the market more quickly.

According &lt;a href="https://periodic-table.rsc.org/element/35/bromine" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;to the Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, the discovery of the element bromine by French chemist Antoine-Jérôme Balard in 1826 led to something of a bromide craze once doctors learned of its powerful anticonvulsant and sedative properties — the same use cases that veterinarians sometimes cite when prescribing it to epileptic dogs today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as these "bromide salts" became a popular treatment for headaches, tummy aches, and general malaise in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the drugs themselves would often build up in the bloodstream of users, leading to bromide toxicity or bromism. Described as a &lt;a href="https://taylorandfrancis.com/knowledge/Medicine_and_healthcare/Neurology/Bromism/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;neuropsychiatric disorder&lt;/a&gt; due to its laundry list of symptoms, overdosing on bromide can lead to everything from confusion and slurred speech to hallucinations, psychosis, and even coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it was estimated around the turn of the 20th century that some &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/570345" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;eight percent of psychiatric hospital admissions&lt;/a&gt; were due to bromism, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2387035/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;those numbers fell sharply&lt;/a&gt; after bromides &lt;a href="https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/reregistration/fs_G-48_1-Sep-93.pdf" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;became regulated&lt;/a&gt; by the Environmental Protection Agency in the 1970s — though as this case shows, it can obviously still happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to replicate the man's conversations, &lt;a href="https://www.404media.co/guy-gives-himself-19th-century-psychiatric-illness-after-consulting-with-chatgpt/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;404 Media&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt; when asking ChatGPT various queries about sodium chloride and sodium bromide that the chatbot readily recommended the dangerous compound.

ChatGPT responded that "you can often substitute it with other halide ions such as: Sodium Bromide (NaBr): Replacing chloride with bromide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the chatbot did follow up to ask for further context, it never warned against using sodium bromide — and also appeared not to know that the primary reason people use sodium chloride is for table salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the release of the GPT-5 large language model (LLM), OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has bragged that this latest model is "&lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/07/openai_gpt_5/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;the best model ever for health&lt;/a&gt;." Given that the unnamed bromism sufferer used, per his doctors' reckoning in their paper, either ChatGPT-3.5 or ChatGPT-4, we certainly hope that's true — if only for the sake of those less AI-literate among us, who seem to trust what these chatbots without a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on ChatGPT and health:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/openai-admits-chatgpt-missed-delusions" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OpenAI Admits ChatGPT Missed Signs of Delusions in Users Struggling With Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 11:30:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTE5TSlVENWNYQUZTNlJSQkVIRWF1OHhtbk9uVzlicjVybXo1UWpiMllncEE5OGgwckhKU1UyV1M1b2ZUeUpNRHFhdk4yRGpUTWNkbjFYRG9qZnZEYW81</guid></item><item><title>俄罗斯研究人员建造了一个口袋大小的热成像仪，可以监测肿瘤切除过程中的血流- The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizwFBVV95cUxQTGZfVjc4Uks1eXZNLU80RUl6b05EenVjSmJOM0dFTDBrTFVna1RQYVpCRkdYQy13Z2xOUWFzeC1ROFNqVUxHeU1xRkl1eEd0bldTa3pWR0pJeWdXN0Jfc1N2UjVIbVBITUxMSWNvRU4tS216VEtqa3RKU1lDWEM5QVZTUThBMVFnTUFJSklkQ0x4UDlRSnItMGlaU1BqaXJNS2gwN0wzNXd4bjlTWUI4SWpPZXd4NnhoRG9hdGdkNG12WkZJNmNCMmV2RmVNQW8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;strong&gt;St. Petersburg State Technical University “leti”&lt;/strong&gt; have developed a compact, fully domestic &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gazeta.ru/science/news/2025/08/07/26437622.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;thermal imaging system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that can monitor &lt;strong&gt;blood flow&lt;/strong&gt; during the surgical removal of tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The technology, currently undergoing trials at the &lt;strong&gt;a.l. polenov russian scientific research neurosurgical institute&lt;/strong&gt;, shows promise for helping surgeons assess tissue &lt;strong&gt;microcirculation&lt;/strong&gt; before, during, and after operations — a critical factor in improving recovery rates and lowering post-surgical complications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With &lt;strong&gt;medical imaging technology&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;tumor surgery innovations&lt;/strong&gt; trending in the healthcare sector, this development aligns with the growing demand for real-time, precision-guided surgical tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Compact Device With Dual-Sensor Accuracy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike standard thermal cameras used in hospitals, this device integrates &lt;strong&gt;two sensors&lt;/strong&gt; — a &lt;strong&gt;small-format matrix sensor&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;point sensor&lt;/strong&gt; — to capture high-resolution &lt;strong&gt;temperature mapping&lt;/strong&gt; from short distances. According to department head &lt;strong&gt;nikolai potrakhov&lt;/strong&gt;, this setup allows surgeons to “determine the exact temperature change at short distances and practically determine the absolute temperature of any area of the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;dual-sensor thermal imaging&lt;/strong&gt; not only delivers sharper images of tissue temperature fields but also requires less space and setup time in the operating room. The device’s compact size and immediate display of results make it suitable for busy surgical environments, where efficiency and accuracy are vital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Real-Time Monitoring for Surgical Precision&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The built-in software automatically detects &lt;strong&gt;abnormal heat patterns&lt;/strong&gt;, a potential sign of compromised blood supply, and highlights these zones for immediate review. It can log temperature changes over time, generate &lt;strong&gt;real-time temperature graphs&lt;/strong&gt;, and store sequential thermal images for later analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Engineer &lt;strong&gt;sergey rostachev&lt;/strong&gt; noted that one sensor monitors blood flow in the tumor area, while the other tracks healthy tissue for direct comparison. This approach gives surgeons continuous feedback during procedures, supporting better decision-making in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/breast-cancer-younger-women-are-at-greater-risk/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="76217" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer surgery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;microcirculation monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tested in Leading St. Petersburg Medical Centers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside its evaluation at the &lt;strong&gt;polenov neurosurgical institute&lt;/strong&gt;, the device has been tested at pavlov first st. petersburg state medical university, the lesgaft national state university of physical education, and the s.m. kirov military medical academy. These trials aim to confirm the system’s versatility across different surgical disciplines, from &lt;strong&gt;neurosurgery&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;oncology procedures&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Built entirely from &lt;strong&gt;domestically sourced components&lt;/strong&gt;, the thermal imager is &lt;strong&gt;cost-effective&lt;/strong&gt;, eliminating reliance on imported medical imaging equipment — a factor that could speed up its adoption across Russian hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Potential Impact on Cancer Surgery Outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surgeons have long recognized that maintaining adequate &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/worlds-first-3d-printed-penis-implant-successfully-restores-function-in-pigs-and-rabbits/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="81793" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tissue blood flow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; during tumor removal can reduce risks like delayed healing or tissue necrosis. By incorporating &lt;strong&gt;precise thermal imaging&lt;/strong&gt; into operations, doctors can identify problem areas instantly and adjust their surgical approach to protect healthy tissue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If large-scale trials confirm its advantages, this &lt;strong&gt;affordable portable thermal imager&lt;/strong&gt; could become a standard in hospitals, expanding access to advanced &lt;strong&gt;intraoperative imaging&lt;/strong&gt; and potentially improving outcomes for thousands of cancer patients each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="article-featured-image" class="article-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/24304146-1-576x1024.jpg" alt="Rebecca Amoroso when her hair started growing back after undergoing chemotherapy for ovarian cancer.  - Photo courtesy Jewel Amoroso "&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rebecca Amoroso when her hair started growing back after undergoing chemotherapy for ovarian cancer.  - Photo courtesy Jewel Amoroso &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AT nine years old in 2023, Rebecca Amoroso learnt she had dysgerminoma – a tumour in her ovaries. And not just that, but it was cancerous. She was sad, but she prayed and hoped for the best for several months. And in 2024, she was officially declared cancer free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca hails from Laventille and is heading into standard five at the St Barbs Government Primary School. She told KIDS she enjoys math and art. And when she’s not studying, she plays video games like Roblox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said life was pretty normal for her. But near the end of 2023, her stomach began to grow while all other parts of her body got smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her mother, Jewel Amoroso, took her to the Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex, Mt Hope. She remained there for some days and was then told she had ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was feeling very sad and I never wanted this to happen, so I cried,” she said in a low tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1551210817264-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was scared,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the words of her mother provided her with great comfort: “She said, ‘You are going to get through this.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1171386" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1171386" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-1171386" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/24304147-1-576x1024.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1171386" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Rebecca Amoroso. - Photo courtesy Jewel Amoroso&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the cancer did not migrate to any other part of the body and remained at stage one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last of five children, Rebecca said her siblings had been telling her they miss her and couldn’t wait for her to return home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They were very sad and they wanted me to spend time with them again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said chemotherapy was a bit gruelling, and recovery after her surgery was also painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She recalled trying to have some broth post-surgery but not being able to finish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even amidst the pain, she found the strength to motivate others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1551381418315-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I encouraged other children (at the hospital) to pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every day, I would pray for my family and for God to keep me safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, she got her wish. She rang the bell after being declared cancer free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But very candidly, when asked what was the first thing that went through her mind when she got the news, she said, “I wanted to go and get ice cream.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She walked to a homemade ice cream shop in her community with her mom and bought a scoop of soursop to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On ringing the bell, she laughingly said, “I had a little complication because I was a little too short, but I did it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1171385" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1171385" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-1171385" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/24303882-1-1024x683.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1171385" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Survivor Talks! President Christine Kangaloo and her husband Kerwyn Garcia speak to cancer survivor, ten-year-old Rebecca Amoroso of Laventille who was elated to meet the president African Emancipation Day, Port of Spain on August 1. - Photo by Jeff K. Mayers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to August 1, 2025 – African Emancipation Day – she had a brief but unexpected meeting with another cancer survivor. During the Kambule street procession in Port of Spain, she met President Christine Kangaloo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kangaloo was diagnosed with stage two receptor-positive breast cancer, which causes cancer cells to use the hormone oestrogen to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1551381513479-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca said, “When I saw her, I went to go and talk to her but she went on a little further, so I walked down with my sister. I said, ‘Hi,’ and she gave me a hug. And it was so great to get to meet the president of our country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s not quite sure what she wants to be when she grows up yet, but she has narrowed it down to a designer, a doctor and a police officer.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

At least 12 other cities across the province have also reported infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Unlike COVID-19, CHIKV is not contagious, with officials reporting that 95 percent of hospitalised patients are discharged within seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Despite not being considered fatal, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/us-news"&gt;the United States&lt;/a&gt;

However, nearly half of the adults in the United States still don’t get enough magnesium from diet alone, making magnesium supplementation a tool for filling in the gaps. “That gap becomes even more likely in people who are physically active,” says Dr. Nima Alamdari, PhD, who serves as the Chief Scientific Officer at Ritual. “ Strenuous exercise increases magnesium loss through sweat and urine, which can raise daily requirements by as much as 10 to 20 percent, according to research.” Ahead, we asked top dieticians, nutritionists, and scientists to answer all our burning magnesium questions, including how to pick the best supplements for every concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;In This Story:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Overall:&lt;/strong&gt; DaVinci Labs Tri-Mag 300 Chelated Magnesium Supplement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe ddXKXd callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hIYvDT cYxZHF product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/4BfJvaXoLe6BJTvQ86TZGMRwFEmPryNHgJPm5DKvrdJpVVAc3nBcCJXgUgavE2d8TZLBRkzRRqxcSmTZGYjj9pkFHV5RAkqqM9NWPzT52XhuSPwZcXUcNUYkRTccw6jsqVMXpTBofpuMaC6rjiDEPnvzeByR6efhLbi5z3KHHFshBvRifCKy2skfAs96715ebABV14mszTiZP8hB92thki1MxsZWKogBnFbh2ASgo6AbgvbQw1wJyYShTYr2sNxidJeXYoi5ksz7b2wuvP5qVzsx5aE","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"DaVinci","dangerousHed":"Labs Tri-Mag 300 -

The blend is measured in micrograms, which means it’s easy to incorporate into your routine at a low and slow dose. Best of all, Juna’s bite-sized gummies are third-party tested, certified organic, and made without added sugar and filler ingredients. Timing can enhance magnesium’s effects, too. “If you’re new to magnesium, start with a low dose and gradually increase as tolerated, " says Fazio. “And look for magnesium supplements that are third‑party tested for quality and purity, and avoid unnecessary fillers, artificial colors, sweeteners, or additives.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of Magnesium:&lt;/strong&gt; Elemental magnesium (with 72 trace minerals)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Per Serving:&lt;/strong&gt; Not listed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 gummy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Gummy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Tasting:&lt;/strong&gt; Moon Juice Magnesi-Om&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; This delicious magnesium is perfect to whip up your own sleep girl mocktail. Just add ice, tart cherry juice, and a fizzy mix-in like sparkling water or soda tonic. It has three forms of magnesium plus &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213453021001324?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;L-theanine&lt;/a&gt;, a non-protein amino acid from tea leaves said to promote feelings of calmness and relaxation, making it a great option right before bed. “I generally like magnesium dosed in the evening, especially if you are using it for relaxation, stress relief, or sleep support,” says Gerber. This powder dissolves almost instantly, so there’s no chalky aftertaste, and has amazing flavors like blue lemon, berry, and cherry—it tastes so good you’ll actually look forward to taking it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of Magnesium:&lt;/strong&gt; Magnesium gluconate, acetyl taurinate, and citrate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Per Serving:&lt;/strong&gt; 310mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 tsp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Powder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Topical:&lt;/strong&gt; Ancient Minerals Magnesium Gel&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; Turns out, beginners can start their with magnesium supplementation in a topical form. “In my opinion, topical magnesium—usually sulfate or chloride forms—is the best starting off point for anyone new to magnesium supplements, especially those who have been stressed for a long time,” explains Gerber. “It can come in transdermal forms like &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-magnesium-sprays" target="_blank"&gt;magnesium gel&lt;/a&gt;, oil, lotion, and even Epsom salts that work for a soothing bath or foot soak with gentle absorption.” With pure magnesium chloride and organic botanicals like aloe vera, this gel smooths onto skin beautifully, absorbs right away, and feels incredible, whether in a tension-relieving massage or post-workout. “Magnesium sulfate and magnesium chloride are great in topicals for muscle relaxation and recovery through absorption via the skin,” says Fazio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of Magnesium:&lt;/strong&gt; Magnesium chloride&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Per Serving:&lt;/strong&gt; 100mg per 1ml&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1ml&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Topical gel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for Constipation:&lt;/strong&gt; Pure Encapsulations Magnesium Citrate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe dKFpDJ

It:&lt;/strong&gt; Pure Encapsulations is a go-to for its clean, non-GMO, and third-party tested formulas that help ensure safety and efficacy in every dose, including its single-ingredient magnesium citrate capsule that helps keep your digestion in check. “Magnsium citrate is an osmotic laxative that helps you poop,” says Gerber. “It gently relieves constipation by drawing water into the stool.” It’s also highly bioavailable, meaning your body can absorb it, and can support the metabolism and breakdown of carbohydrates, amino acids, and fats in the body, ensuring smoother digestion. “Taken before bed, magnesium citrate can promote both relaxation and a morning bowel movement,” Fazio adds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of Magnesium:&lt;/strong&gt; Magnesium

L-Threonate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; You can squeeze this vanilla cream-flavored gel directly into your mouth or mix it with water—either way it tastes good and delivers 94mg of magnesium l-threonate.“I like Magnesium L‑Threonate by Cymbiotika, which is formulated in a liposomal delivery system to enhance absorption and bioavailability,” says Fazio. “This form is designed to cross the blood–brain barrier, supporting cognitive health, memory, and focus, making it an excellent choice for those experiencing mental fatigue or high cognitive demands. Plus, it tastes great, which helps with taking it consistently.” One gel packet per day is all you need.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of Magnesium:&lt;/strong&gt; Magnesium

Here, Fazio breaks down the different types and benefits of each:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Glycinate:&lt;/strong&gt; This form is highly bioavailable and gentle on the stomach, making it ideal for stress relief, relaxation, sleep support, and general magnesium repletion. It’s well tolerated, even for those with sensitive digestion, and is less likely to cause changes in bowel habits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Citrate:&lt;/strong&gt; This form is well-absorbed and commonly used for occasional constipation as it draws water into the stool. Taken before bed, it can promote both relaxation and a morning bowel movement. If constipation isn’t your main concern, magnesium glycinate is often a better choice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Malate:&lt;/strong&gt; This form supports energy production and muscle recovery, making it a good option for people experiencing fatigue, soreness, or chronic muscle pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium L‑Threonate:&lt;/strong&gt; This form is unique for its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, supporting memory, focus, and overall cognitive health. It’s often chosen for those with high mental demands or for sleep support linked to brain relaxation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Oxide:&lt;/strong&gt; This form is poorly absorbed, with a strong laxative effect. It’s best reserved for short‑term constipation relief, such as during travel, and should be followed by rehydration and electrolyte support due to fluid losses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium sulfate and magnesium chloride:&lt;/strong&gt; These forms are typically used topically for muscle relaxation and recovery through absorption via the skin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="best" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM fhuYhW"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the best form of magnesium to take?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best form of magnesium ultimately depends on your goals. Overall, for those looking for a versatile, well-tolerated option, Gerber, Fazio, and Alamdari all agree that magnesium glycinate is the top daily choice. “For sleep and nervous system support, magnesium glycinate or magnesium L‑threonate are excellent options and pairs well with an evening wind-down routine to enhance relaxation and sleep quality,” says Fazio. “Magnesium L‑threonate also stands out for cognitive function and focus, because it can cross the blood-brain barrier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to occasional constipation, Fazio notes that magnesium citrate or magnesium oxide are both options. “Magnesium citrate is often the most effective choice for occasional constipation,” she says. “Magnesium oxide can be used short‑term for travel-related constipation, but it’s harsh on the digestive system and not recommended for regular use.” She recommends taking it one to two hours before bedtime, noting if you’re using it for constipation relief, bedtime dosing is often “more effective since it may take several hours to work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerber recommends magnesium malate or topical magnesium for muscle recovery or soreness, noting it’s better suited for daytime use. “Magnesium malate is best for overall energy production and muscle function,” she says. “Topical magnesium—like sulfate or chloride—can be used in a massage or bath soak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="consider" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM fhuYhW"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to Consider When Taking Magnesium Supplements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, magnesium supplements are widely considered safe and well-tolerated when used as directed. Typically magnesium can be taken at any time of day but a lot of experts find it’s helpful in the evening to support muscle relaxation and better sleep. The key is consistency, taking it daily, at a time that fits your routine. “Some forms of magnesium are better tolerated with food,” says Alamdari. “But magnesium bisglycinate is gentle enough to take on an empty stomach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that magnesium can interfere with the absorption of other minerals. “It can affect absorption of calcium, zinc, and iron if taken together in high doses,” says Fazio. “It may also interact with certain prescription medications, including some antibiotics, diuretics, thyroid medications, and blood pressure medications, so be sure to space magnesium at least two hours apart from iron, calcium, high-dose zinc, or thyroid medications to avoid absorption issues.” Of course, if you’re taking prescription medications or have any underlying health issues, always check with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people report feeling “wired” or restless after taking magnesium. “This can happen when electrolyte balance—particularly sodium or potassium levels—is off,” says Fazio. “Magnesium works closely with these other electrolytes to regulate nerve signaling and muscle function, so an imbalance may change how magnesium feels in the body.” Gerber notes that taking too much magnesium can cause further sodium depletion and &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-electrolyte-drink" target="_blank"&gt;electrolyte&lt;/a&gt; imbalances if someone is struggling with lower cellular sodium levels. “It is common in states of high chronic stress and can be tested using something called HTMA testing for intracellular mineral status,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="meet" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://ritual.com/articles/the-science-behind-essential-protein" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://ritual.com/articles/the-science-behind-essential-protein"}' href="https://ritual.com/articles/the-science-behind-essential-protein" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nima Alamdari&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, is a Harvard-trained muscle physiologist specializing in health and sports science.

            In a large and hastily arranged Zoom call on Saturday, about 800 rattled staffers with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tried to make sense of the trauma they endured just a day earlier when a gunman opened fire on the agency’s buildings from across the street.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4leg4x00003b6nbbjqz0ps@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They had been winding down for the weekend when more than 40 bullets smashed through their office windows, whizzing just over their cubicle walls and petrifying staffers in at least four buildings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4qeu7r00003b6nprcbwhys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Friday’s violent episode is the latest unsettling new chapter to what has been a turbulent period for the CDC. While authorities have not announced a motive for the shooting, law enforcement sources say the suspect may have targeted the CDC over health concerns he blamed on the Covid-19 vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4r28r600023b6n4ugddhxv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the world’s leading health agencies, the CDC is tasked with protecting the health of Americans. But it has come under fire during the second Trump administration as conspiracy theories continue to plague the vaccine credited with halting the spread of the global pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4r2vjz00063b6nvrslfnlf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The attack on the CDC offices had been targeted and deliberate, CDC leaders told staff on the call. Staffers might hear their work was targeted as a possible motivation for the shooter, leadership added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4m9hjn000h3b6n5n81ulpv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CDC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Debra Houry acknowledged the terror staffers experienced whether they were in the building or not, saying leaders were “mad this happened.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4mboqv000k3b6nf7yspcgp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Leaders told staffers, many of whom work in the agency’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, the attack was carried out by a shooter who had been reaching out for mental health assistance for weeks before the incident but had not made any threats ahead of time, according to two sources who spoke on the condition they not be named.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4mgb3y000r3b6n72klw4e1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s unclear who the suspect, identified as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, was reaching out to. The investigation into what led to the shooting is ongoing.
    &lt;/p&gt;





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4o5g7n002s3b6nbj9t2bjb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The shooting began just before 5 p.m. at the Emory Point CVS drugstore on Clifton Road, directly across from the main entrance to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4ok6k700303b6nbk58jyl1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The gunman – wearing what appeared to be a surgical mask and armed with two handguns, a rifle, a shotgun and two backpacks filled with ammo – fired on &lt;a href="https://x.com/cdcmonarez/status/1953989005122441401?s=46" target="_blank"&gt;at least four&lt;/a&gt; CDC buildings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4ohckn002x3b6nz82236de@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were at least 40 bullet&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;holes in two buildings, as well as a few in a third building, CDC leaders said on the call Saturday. The buildings house much of the non-lab work at CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4rm2kd001f3b6n47wjqj5x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This was not stray bullets,” one leader said on the call, sharing updates from the authorities. CNN obtained copies of staff notes from the meeting, which were shared in a large employee group chat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4s26xp001p3b6n0agcrch3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CDC employees said on Saturday’s call they felt like “sitting ducks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4rcdi8000o3b6nz9uvpwog@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Photos viewed by CNN taken from inside one CDC building depict bullet holes in windows and shattered glass on the floor. The images show rounds of ammunition flew just above a line of office cubicles where employees sit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4rlusp00183b6nupi0asu5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As the gunman fired at the CDC complex, DeKalb County police officer David Rose pulled up. The shooter turned his aim from the CDC complex to the officer, according to a law enforcement source.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4rm2xi001h3b6nxw2vao8j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rose, 33, was shot and later died at a hospital. A married father of two, with another on the way, Rose would have made one year on the job next month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4omq6f00363b6na5py8ytb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After a tense lockdown stretching into the night, the gunman was struck by gunfire and found dead on the second floor of the CVS store. Police could not say if the gunfire came from officers or the gunman himself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4oxe24003d3b6nrfqyj3ne@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the CDC offices, employees said the situation could have been much worse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4p0bcp003n3b6nn6fd6flg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a miracle no one was killed here,” one CDC employee told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Shooting happened amid vaccine misinformation and slashed CDC funding
&lt;/h2&gt;

            After speaking with family members of the suspect, police are operating under the hypothesis he was either sick or believed he was sick and blamed the illness on the Covid-19 vaccine, a law enforcement official told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4mwjsy000w3b6nppy9kr8n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The shooting occurred the same week US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – a longtime critic of Covid vaccinations, with a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/21/politics/fact-check-rfk-not-anti-vax/index.html"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of spreading vaccine misinformation – &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the cancellation of a half-billion dollars in investments in mRNA projects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4nbddv001g3b6nm28m96zz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS said it would cancel federal funding for nearly two dozen mRNA vaccine projects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4p4n2i003y3b6nfjb4g4j4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at CDC’s Atlanta campus that took the life of officer David Rose,” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1954197860754350238" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Saturday. “No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4p4er5003t3b6n27cune6g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Public health workers show up every day with purpose — even in moments of grief and uncertainty,” the health secretary continued. “We honor their service. We stand with them. And we remain united in our mission to protect and improve the health of every American.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4ncog6001j3b6na46k5k6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When asked on the Saturday call if she had spoken to Kennedy about his plan to address the shooting, CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez responded they’ve been in contact with his office, according to staff notes obtained by CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4nk8p2001u3b6nuv5qt80p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Monarez was also asked what the agency planned to do to address disinformation, but agency leaders on the call did not directly respond.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4nk6sn001r3b6ns3yd6axd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Monarez informed CDC staff via email they will work remotely on Monday while a “security assessment” is conducted. Employee assistance personnel were made available to workers, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4o42f0002o3b6nq7sqqr07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said CDC employees have “had a tough go of it in the past year,” referencing the “uncertainty” around CDC staff’s employment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4nuza500203b6n36hi08tb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The agency has lost nearly a quarter of its staff since January. The Trump administration’s proposed budget for the fiscal year 2026 would slash the agency’s funding by more than half.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4nwmze00233b6nm9mxlod7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under the proposed reorganization, the CDC would lose additional programs. Some would be transferred to a new Administration for a Healthy America, while others - such as the National Center for Chronic Disease and Health Promotion - would be eliminated entirely.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4nxgko00293b6n7ghs897z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My heart goes out to you,” Dickens said. “We are with you. We stand with you, and we’re doing everything we can to make sure that we bring resolve to the situation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

My name is Kaitlin Reilly, and I am rounding up the best health and wellness tips the internet has to offer this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Do you start the morning with a glass of OJ? A potential change to orange juice is coming, thanks to a new regulation proposed by the Trump administration calling for it to be made with less sugary oranges, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fda-targeting-orange-juice-why-170413306.html" data-ylk="slk:the Washington Post reports;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;the Washington Post reports&lt;/a&gt;. The Food and Drug Administration is proposing to lower the minimum sugar content required for orange juice to be labeled as “pasteurized orange juice,” in response to a request from Florida’s citrus industry, which is struggling with declining sugar levels in its crops. The change would slightly reduce sugar per serving but wouldn’t significantly affect taste or nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But while orange juice has long been a staple of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/are-people-losing-their-appetite-for-the-classic-american-breakfast-090059808.html" data-ylk="slk:the classic American breakfast;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;the classic American breakfast&lt;/a&gt;, is it really a good option to start your morning? Maybe not, nutrition experts tell the Washington Post. Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina, calls orange juice — and every juice — nothing more than “sugar water,” and that remains true even if it’s made with slightly less sugar. And while orange juice does contain calcium and vitamin C, you’re far better off eating a real orange, which has &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/happens-body-drink-juice-every-153041684.html" data-ylk="slk:fiber that can balance out your blood sugar levels;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;fiber that can balance out your blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; and keep you from crashing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While you rethink your a.m. beverage, we’re here to help you get ready for the week ahead.

As such, he recommends an approach he calls “front-loading,” which means getting the majority of your calories earlier in the day (think: a hearty breakfast and/or lunch, followed by a lighter dinner around 5 to 7 p.m.). This, he explains, better aligns with your circadian rhythm and may boost metabolism, blood sugar control and even sleep. And since research shows that eating at night is associated with weight gain and unstable blood sugar levels (which can lead to chronic health issues over time), it’s best to avoid big or heavy meals shortly before bedtime. An easy way to break down your daily calorie intake is to aim for 25% to 40% at breakfast, 30% to 40% at lunch and 15% to 20% at dinner, with snacks making up the rest of your day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/foot" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🦶;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🦶&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Step up your foot game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Giving your feet a little TLC can help you avoid pain and improve mobility and strength. Dana Santas, a strength and conditioning specialist, tells &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/your-body/foot-health/articles/know-improving-foot-strength-according-105433006.html" data-ylk="slk:CNN;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; that she recommends her clients roll their bare feet over a textured ball twice a day, making sure to shift position every 30 seconds to target different areas of the foot. Don’t have a textured ball? A golf or lacrosse ball works too in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another easy way to ensure you’re giving your feet proper care? Try wearing toe spacers for 15 to 20 minutes a night, Santas says. You’ll fight foot fatigue and counteract the effects of restrictive footwear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/french-fries" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🍟;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🍟&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Skip the fries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We’re so sorry to tell you this: Research published in the BMJ found that eating these fast food favorites often — about three servings per week — can raise your risk of type 2 diabetes by up to 20%. Those who ate baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes did not see a large rise of their risk, however. While the link between french fries and diabetes was not clear from the research, experts tell &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/nutrition/weight-loss/articles/study-potatoes-shocked-experts-rethink-233400999.html" data-ylk="slk:Women’s Health;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt; that it could be related to the overall eating habits of people who eat them frequently. (For example, if you’re hitting up the drive-through multiple times a week instead of eating nutrient-dense meals.) Plus, dietitian Jessica Cording points out that it’s easy to eat large quantities of fries at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You don’t have to give up fries entirely, experts say. Just eat them alongside fiber-packed veggies and lean proteins and make the majority of your meals as nutritious as possible. An occasional bag of fries shouldn’t raise your diabetes risk much if eaten as part of a balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;🏠 &lt;strong&gt;Consider a HEPA filter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Live near a busy road? You could be exposed to indoor air pollution, which can cause high blood pressure. And if moving isn't an option, consider new research that suggests using HEPA air purifiers.

While those with normal blood pressure saw no change, these filters could be a good call for anyone concerned about their numbers and the pollution around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/hamburger" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🍔;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🍔&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Add this 1 thing to your burger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Give your burger an upgrade by adding something plant-based to your ground beef, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/blend-1-ingredient-burger-patties-120000088.html" data-ylk="slk:Today;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt; suggests. Mushrooms are a great pick, from both a flavor and a health standpoint. They boast good-for-you nutrients like vitamin D, selenium, potassium and B vitamins, and because they’re low in calories, adding them to your patty mix (and cutting down on the beef) keeps your burger from being such a calorie bomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/television" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:📺;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;📺&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Scale back screen time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A study published in the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="link " href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.12.24310353?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of the American Heart Association;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; found that too much screen time can come with health risks for children. Looking at 1,000 kids who spent time on screens like gaming consoles, smartphones and TVs, researchers saw that those with higher amounts of screen time were at a greater risk of heart and metabolic issues, like high blood pressure and insulin resistance. One potential reason the researchers gave, according to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/excessive-screen-time-linked-heart-090018531.html" data-ylk="slk:CBS News;cpos:17;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, is that screen time can cut into all-important sleep, pushing bedtimes later and reducing overall hours snoozing. While the study only looked at 10- and 18-year-olds, it stands to reason that people of all ages could benefit from a little less scrolling and a lot more sleep.

But if you’re rusty in the exercise department, experts warn against overdoing it, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/fitness/exercise/articles/starting-workout-routine-feel-overwhelming-093400032.html" data-ylk="slk:Women’s Health;cpos:20;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt; reports. Signing up for an intense, early-morning boot camp or challenging yourself to use your monthly gym pass every day might not be sustainable over time. Personal trainer Kristen McParland says that it’s “really difficult for a beginner to go from zero days to five.” It’s better to “smart small and build,” she advises. Maybe that’s hitting an exercise class twice a week to start, or going for a run on Sunday mornings until you get into a nice groove. And don’t push yourself to work out in the mornings if you loathe getting up early — you’ll eventually abandon your routine. As McParland says, the “best time” to work out is the one that works for you and your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/cookie" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🍪;cpos:21;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🍪&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Cut back on ultraprocessed foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Need one more reason to cut out ultraprocessed foods, such as packaged cookies and chips?

While it’s unclear what is behind this association, it’s not the first study to find negative impacts of ultraprocessed foods, which can often be higher in sugar and fat, as well as lower in fiber, vitamins and minerals, than whole food options. One way to combat the health risks of ultraprocessed foods is to aim for whole foods (vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, nuts and eggs) whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/fish" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐟;cpos:24;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐟&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Eat fatty fish for better cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When we think of cholesterol, we often think about reducing our “bad cholesterol” — aka LDL, which can build up in the arteries and increase the risk of heart disease.

The warm, nutty spice is rich in antioxidants, and past research has found that it can help alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel symptom, such as uncomfortable bloating.

Why? These teas — particularly green and hibiscus — contain blood vessel-widening polyphenols, which allows for better blood flow and oxygen delivery to the rest of your body. Just stick to a couple of cups a day, and be aware of any side effects or medicine interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;🥛 &lt;strong&gt;Don’t mix these meds with dairy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You’ve probably heard that grapefruit can interfere with certain medications, but dairy can cause problems too.

It's also best to avoid dairy for at least four hours before taking levothyroxine (for thyroid issues), lithium (for bipolar disorder) and eltrombopag (used to boost platelet count). Got the flu and were prescribed baloxavir? Skip not only dairy but also other calcium-rich foods like sardines — or even Tums, which contain 500 mg of calcium carbonate — since they can interfere with how the drug works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 09:00:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwJBVV95cUxOMG1OS2tJcmU3VWNWSkVKSGUycVhzMU8wd0lfWklua1ZSTWRmUmFVdmprYjNEZFhtbV9Zc3FUcHNKNkZNZEtST3ZSX3Jfb202azFhOU9mR0Q2RGFiWU8wUFhXWXNfU2hEc0cxa1QwbE9sRVUzbDV4NHBVZmdfVDZNMkxWWldBZUxaaFJOcnhnVnhPcTVBbGNUdlpNc3poTnM5TGlXOVdKak5ZX2hTemhaOHBCLWNHdHlqcUlGU1FqbXoyci00VS1YUnlGeTJ5NTF4WWozb3VMaG1iS1hzUVh4aGRPYXRHZHZQMjNiQ3V6RVh4TnRDQ0E2T3VDQi1lNEVOUUNKd1ZCemp0aXc</guid></item><item><title>你能在非快速眼动睡眠期间做梦吗？ - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPMkdfd3FPQzNTY1F1VTVUOXJjR18wWUpEbWM2cktndGlsVXQ2TTZTMnVzQkUxZTlsM2MwbU1lTldmamlfdURmMHZiS3IyMjVKM2pWZDJjVWhJbEkxUmZNUEUyZldzRXBrYWdvN0JKb1A2SzhQQV9tTXRUZHlsaWl1Q3BR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p id="e5fff01e-127c-461d-a811-61591ee3ecec"&gt;Both Salvador Dalí and Thomas Edison are said to have used &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/little-known-sleep-stage-may-be-creative-sweet-spot" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/little-known-sleep-stage-may-be-creative-sweet-spot"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dreams to stoke their creative process&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. To spark new ideas, the men would let themselves drift off to sleep for just a few moments, and then wake up and note the dreamlike visions they had on the brink of unconsciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you may have heard that dreams happen only in a stage called rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. So is it possible to dream during other stages of sleep, as Dali and Edison supposedly did??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="e5fff01e-127c-461d-a811-61591ee3ecec-2"&gt;Although dreams in different sleep stages can take on different forms, REM sleep is definitely not the only time we dream, experts told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="108d3952-d38c-4d84-a402-11c8b4e6b2da"&gt;"The belief that dreams are only associated with REM sleep comes from people who are not familiar with the subject in detail, or who have somewhat outdated knowledge," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://parisbraininstitute.org/collaborators/arnulf-isabelle" target="_blank" data-url="https://parisbraininstitute.org/collaborators/arnulf-isabelle" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Isabelle Arnulf&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep neurologist at Sorbonne University in Paris, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When REM sleep was first described in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10782487/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10782487/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1950s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it had a couple of easily observable characteristics that prompted scientists to link the sleep stage to dreams. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/12148-sleep-basics" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/12148-sleep-basics" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;REM sleep&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which makes up about 25% of our total time asleep, is characterized by brain waves that resemble electrical activity during wakefulness, fast eye movements and full-body paralysis. Scientists theorized that these rapid eye movements reflected people "watching" their dreams and that the body was paralyzed to prevent them from acting out those dreams in real life. While these theories about REM sleep still hold, scientists now know that these outward physical characteristics aren't necessarily required for dreams to take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="15470c9b-daf9-4e1e-9d9a-871ef9d06349"&gt;It is true that when people are awoken during REM sleep, they often report remembering vivid dreams with a strong narrative thread. But since the discovery of REM sleep, further research has shown that people dream during non-REM (NREM) sleep, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-happens-brain-sleep" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-happens-brain-sleep"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens in your brain while you sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810012001250" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810012001250" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Arnulf used a drug to suppress REM sleep in a small group of participants and then regularly woke them up throughout the night to see if they'd had any dreams. Many participants reported remembering dream-like mental content upon waking up, even though they had never entered REM sleep. Based on their reports, the structure and content of those dreams was a little different, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NREM dreams are less frequent, shorter, less vivid, more conceptual or thought-like, and often lack a clear narrative," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nin.nl/author/siclariherseninstituut-knaw-nl/" target="_blank" data-url="https://nin.nl/author/siclariherseninstituut-knaw-nl/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Francesca Siclari&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep researcher at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, told Live Science in an email. "In contrast, REM dreams are almost always story-like, vivid, and rich in sensory detail. That said, there's a lot of variability. Sometimes NREM dreams are very minimal in content, and other times they can be remarkably similar to REM dreams."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siclari has used electroencephalography (EEG) — a technique that measures electrical activity in the brain — to learn more about dreams during different sleep stages.

Scientists still don't understand exactly how the brain generates dreams, why we have such a hard time remembering them, and why we even dream at all. They hope if they can learn more about dreams — and the different sleep stages in which they occur — it could reveal deeper truths about how the human brain works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[Dreaming is] much more frequent and varied than most people realize — we typically remember only a tiny fraction of our dreams," Siclari said. "Studying them gives us a unique perspective on how the mind works when it’s decoupled from the outside world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="63d469bd-abd9-4be1-9492-57dfecdba345"&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3509e341-24e1-4962-918d-26e79fdf6341" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="sleep-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-sleep-and-dreams-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/sleep/science-of-sleep-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-sleep-and-dreams?hasComeFromProof=true" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/sleep/science-of-sleep-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-sleep-and-dreams?hasComeFromProof=true"&gt;Sleep quiz&lt;/a&gt;: How much do you know about sleep and dreams?&lt;/h2&gt;

While the well-known proverb claims that “an apple a day keeps the doctor away,” experts suggest that doubling this habit could bring even greater benefits. Gastroenterologist Dr. Joseph Salhab recently highlighted how eating two apples daily can help reduce the risk of fatty liver disease, protect against colon cancer, improve heart health, regulate blood sugar levels, and even support weight management. Apples are rich in fibre, antioxidants, and essential nutrients, making them a simple yet effective addition to a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While apples are not a miracle cure, eating two apples daily is a simple, sustainable habit with far-reaching health benefits. From improving liver and colon health to supporting cardiovascular wellness, regulating blood sugar, and aiding weight management, apples prove that sometimes the simplest dietary changes can have the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How two apples a day can make a significant difference to your well-being&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples are an impressive combination of soluble and insoluble fibre, vitamin C, potassium, and powerful antioxidants such as quercetin and polyphenols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soluble fibre, known as pectin, plays a critical role in cholesterol reduction, blood sugar control, and digestive health by nourishing beneficial gut bacteria and improving nutrient absorption. The antioxidants protect cells from oxidative damage, which is one of the main contributors to chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Eating two apples daily increases the intake of these beneficial compounds, creating a steady, natural supply of nutrients that work in harmony to maintain metabolic balance and strengthen immunity. Regular apple consumption also supports weight management, reduces inflammation, promotes healthy skin, and enhances overall cardiovascular and cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Supporting liver function and reducing fatty liver risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease is an increasingly common health issue, particularly linked to high-fat diets, sedentary lifestyles, and metabolic disorders. Apples can aid in preventing and managing this condition because their soluble fibre binds with cholesterol and fat, limiting their absorption in the digestive tract. The liver is spared from storing excess fat, reducing the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Additionally, the polyphenols in apples reduce oxidative stress and inflammation—two key processes that lead to liver cell damage. By consuming two apples daily, these protective benefits are amplified, providing an extra layer of defense for long-term liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Colon health and cancer prevention&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer is one of the most common types of cancer globally, often linked to a diet low in fibre and antioxidants. Apples address this risk on two fronts: improved bowel regularity and antioxidant protection. The pectin fibre in apples acts like a natural cleansing agent for the colon, preventing constipation and reducing the time harmful substances spend in the digestive tract. Meanwhile, antioxidants neutralize free radicals that could damage colon cells and trigger cancerous changes. Research suggests that people who regularly consume apples have a lower risk of developing colon cancer, and eating two apples daily may strengthen this natural defense even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Heart health and cholesterol balance&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol management is another area where apples excel. The pectin in apples binds to cholesterol molecules in the digestive system and removes them from the body, lowering levels of LDL cholesterol—the so-called “bad cholesterol.” This contributes to cleaner arteries, better blood flow, and a reduced risk of plaque buildup, which is associated with heart disease. The antioxidants in apples also prevent oxidative damage to arterial walls, reducing inflammation and maintaining healthy blood vessels. Eating two apples every day supports healthier cholesterol levels and offers long-term cardiovascular protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Regulating blood sugar and reducing diabetes risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though apples have a naturally sweet taste, their fibre content slows sugar absorption into the bloodstream. This prevents sudden spikes in blood sugar, making apples a smart choice for people trying to manage or prevent type 2 diabetes. Polyphenols in apples further improve insulin sensitivity, helping the body use glucose more efficiently. Eating two apples daily ensures steady energy levels, a reduced risk of insulin resistance, and better overall blood sugar stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Weight management and digestive health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two apples a day can also assist with natural weight management. Their high water and fibre content create a sense of fullness, reducing the urge to snack on processed or high-calorie foods. Over time, this can lead to improved calorie control and healthy weight loss. Additionally, the fibre in apples acts as a prebiotic, feeding beneficial gut bacteria that improve digestion, immunity, and even mental health. A balanced gut microbiome supported by regular apple consumption enhances nutrient absorption and overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt; Consult a healthcare provider before making significant changes to your diet or health routine, especially if you have existing medical conditions or allergies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/how-a-suspected-flu-led-to-a-brain-tumour-diagnosis-for-a-26-year-old-man-dont-ignore-headaches-fatigue-and-other-warning-signs/articleshow/123134962.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;How a suspected flu led to a brain tumour diagnosis for a 26-year-old: Don’t ignore headaches, fatigue and other warning signs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
