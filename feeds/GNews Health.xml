That’s a whole-killed viral vaccine,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Other whole-virus vaccines use live but weakened versions of viruses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ead25c" class="body-graf"&gt;Campbell said that over many years of vaccine research, scientists have been able to identify the parts of a virus that are likeliest to activate the immune system and train it to fight back against an invading pathogen. Those parts are known as “antigens.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1dc9b2" class="body-graf"&gt;If the immune system is like the body’s bloodhound, tracking down invaders, then many newer vaccine technologies that target specific antigens present the bloodhound with just the pieces of the invader’s clothes that are most helpful to it. A whole-virus vaccine, on the other hand, would instead be like presenting a bloodhound with an invader’s entire wardrobe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4af3f" class="body-graf"&gt;Campbell said that it may sound better at first glance to use the whole virus rather than key pieces of it but that additional pieces of the virus might not actually do anything to improve the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-de923a" class="body-graf"&gt;“For example, hepatitis B vaccine is one antigen, the hepatitis B surface antigen, and it is almost 100% protective against hepatitis B. You do not need the whole hepatitis B virus,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-40ae50" class="body-graf"&gt;Offit agreed. “The hepatitis B vaccine has virtually eliminated hepatitis B infections in young children,” he said. “So that’s good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-afcf7d" class="body-graf"&gt;Campbell offered Covid-19 vaccines as another example. “There were whole-virus Covid vaccines, but they weren’t used in the United States, they were used elsewhere, and if you look at the general protection from them, it’s not as good,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ddd07d" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/75/8/1442/6567428" target="_blank"&gt;A study from Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, found that people who got a whole-virus Covid vaccine were more than 1.5 times to twice as likely to be infected than those who had been immunized with an mRNA vaccine that targeted only the virus’ spike protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-343ee7" class="body-graf"&gt;“If killed whole-virus vaccines for Covid were thought to be the best technology to move forward with back when the pandemic started, we would have,” Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-275e8b" class="body-graf"&gt;Improperly deploying whole-virus vaccines when they aren’t needed isn’t just unnecessary; in some cases, it can be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44689b" class="body-graf"&gt;Campbell pointed to the development of the RSV vaccine as a case in point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-66447b" class="body-graf"&gt;“When we used whole-virus killed RSV vaccine many years ago, rather than protect children from RSV, it led to what we call ‘antibody-dependent enhancement,’” he said. “Children had a worse RSV than if they had not been vaccinated, and that was because they had formalin-inactivated whole-virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-191c09" class="body-graf"&gt;That RSV vaccine trial was in the 1960s, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rsv-vaccine-kids-rsv-vaccine-babies-toddlers-rcna53956" target="_blank"&gt;it set research back decades&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fddb9e" class="body-graf"&gt;Ever since then, Campbell said, RSV vaccination has either been directed only against the F protein, a piece of the virus, or it has used a monoclonal antibody, which is like a preformed immune response. The first RSV vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-rsv-vaccine-rcna82461" target="_blank"&gt;approved in 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ee35f7" class="body-graf"&gt;“Those protect really well,” he said. “We do not want to use whole-virus killed vaccine for RSV. It will hurt people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ce16fa" class="body-graf"&gt;Some whole-virus vaccines are still used. The hepatitis A and rabies vaccines are killed whole-virus vaccines, meaning they include the constituent pieces of the virus that have been inactivated.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Seasonal flu vaccines also use whole-virus technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a2b931" class="body-graf"&gt;Campbell said it’s possible that a whole-virus vaccine could be an optimal choice for some pathogens in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3062a6" class="body-heading"&gt;In pursuit of a universal flu vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fb337d" class="body-graf"&gt;But as for whether the whole-virus platform will unlock new innovation in the pursuit of a universal flu vaccine, as &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-nih-announces-generation-gold-standard.html" target="_blank"&gt;suggested by the Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;, Campbell said that it would be possible to use whole-virus vaccines if they could be genetically engineered to express multiple flu strain antigens but that it doesn’t have much to do with the whole-virus platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb027f" class="body-graf"&gt;“If it’s just whole-virus, and it’s one strain, that’s what we do now,” Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dabe8c" class="body-graf"&gt;Emily Hilliard, the press secretary for HHS, said in a statement: “Generation Gold Standard marks a critical step in restoring strategic focus and radical transparency to America’s pandemic preparedness.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7cf4fb" class="body-graf"&gt;“Developed entirely by government scientists — free from industry influence — the BPL vaccine platform could provide broad, long-lasting protection against all influenza viral pathogens, including influenza and coronaviruses, with the added potential to block transmission and stop outbreaks at the source,” Hilliard said. BPL, or beta-propiolactone, is a chemical that has been used for decades to kill the viruses used in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b7fe59" class="body-graf"&gt;A universal flu vaccine has been a longtime goal of scientists, as it would ideally offer yearslong protection against the flu. Because of how quickly the virus mutates, yearly flu shots are needed to protect against the most current strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-531f45" class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s a lot of different avenues that people are working, and if we choose only one of those — especially one that’s a very old technology that people have tried so many times before and failed to make a universal flu vaccine — I think it’s putting all our eggs in one basket and not really moving the field along,” Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b7ea0" class="body-graf"&gt;Offit said withdrawing research funding for mRNA vaccines could be particularly harmful in the event of a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-db97aa" class="body-graf"&gt;“If something bad happens, like there is a bird flu pandemic, for example, we will be less prepared,” he said, adding that mRNA technology has a shorter production cycle than whole-killed virus vaccines, meaning an mRNA vaccine would be available much sooner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f71e0" class="body-graf"&gt;Rasmussen said, “We’d probably need a year to scale to full national scale manufacturing” using a whole-virus vaccine, adding, “You actually have to grow a ton of virus and then inactivate it and then make sure it’s inactivated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-00f42b" class="body-graf"&gt;With other vaccine technologies, like protein subunit or mRNA, “you basically just make the protein or the mRNA, which can be done synthetically, without requiring any virus or anything to grow it in,” she said. “They’re much easier to change and adapt as needed, as new strains might emerge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d6de49" class="body-graf"&gt;Offit said, “One of the studies among the 22 studies that were eliminated in that $500 million withdrawal was looking at to what extent the mRNA technology would be valuable for bird flu.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-606388" class="body-graf"&gt;Ultimately, Campbell said, science should lead the way, not top-down dicta that tie scientists’ hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1e89d" class="body-graf"&gt;“The devil is in the details, not just in sweeping statements about what platform is an appropriate platform and which is not,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-923237" class="body-graf"&gt;Multiple platforms are available for vaccine development, which are tested for their respective properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2b3492" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Eventually, one or two, maybe, rise to look the best, and those are the ones that people continue to pursue,” he said. “That’s what we do in vaccinology, is try to figure out what works and what doesn’t work, both by basic science, by immunology, by models of diseases, before they get into humans, and then actual human studies to compare and contrast immune responses, safety and protection, not just sweeping statements about platform.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC

and can lead to inflammation and scarring over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almost a fifth of patients&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6998481/Heart-failure-deaths-surging-young-Americans-study-finds.html"&gt; developed heart failure &lt;/a&gt;over that period, while nearly half showed signs of heart failure despite never being formally diagnosed with a cardiac condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The burden of MASLD in the US is significant, affecting more than one in three US adults on average. The disease stems from the body's difficulty processing fats and sugars and often progresses without causing noticeable symptoms until it reaches a severe, sometimes irreversible, stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A person in the early stages of disease can have a significant amount of liver fat and some scarring without feeling sick, allowing the disease to progress undetected for years or even decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest research found that as MASLD slowly and silently scars the liver until it can no longer filter toxins from the blood, the heart becomes progressively weaker and prone to failure. Yet only five percent of patients in the study had ever been diagnosed with heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marat Fudim, a researcher at Duke Clinical Research Institute and co-author of the report, said in a statement: ‘The findings highlight a critical gap in the recognition and diagnosis of heart failure in this high-risk group.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Nearly 100 million Americans have a chronic liver disease that results when too much fat builds up and causes scarring (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers specifically selected 570 patients with MASLD that was confirmed by a liver biopsy - ‘the gold standard for diagnosis,’ Dr Fudim said, because it provides the most accurate diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patients had been diagnosed with MASLD between 2007 and 2013 and were followed until they died or until January 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age of the study population was about 50 years. Less than two percent had been diagnosed with heart failure before the liver biopsy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 40 percent had diabetes, 59 percent had high blood pressure and almost 60 percent had high levels of fat in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seventy-one patients (12.5 percent) died during the study’s follow-up period. Of these, nine were liver-related, three were due to cardiovascular causes, 23 were due to other known causes, and the cause of death could not be ascertained on manual chart review in 36 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over that period, researchers found that 100 patients in the study met the criteria for heart failure despite not having been formally diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those with stage 4-level liver scarring, indicating the most advanced form of the disease, 33 percent who had not been diagnosed before the study were deemed to have heart failure by the researchers when the study was completed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The biggest risk factors were being older and female, potentially due to decreasing levels of estrogen, which protects against liver dysfunction, as women age. Other conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, also increased the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The graph comes from an unrelated study that projected the number of US adults with MASLD will rise from 86 million (33.7 percent) in 2020 to 122 million (41.4 percent) by 2050&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;The lack of symptoms of MASLD in the early stages leads to patients being diagnosed at a point where damage to the liver may be extensive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also looked for early warning signs of heart failure, such as shortness of breath, swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet, irregular or rapid heartbeat, and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also considered how many times people had been hospitalized for heart trouble, blood tests showing key markers of heart strain, and scans showing the heart was stiff and had trouble filling with blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They discovered that many more people had clues pointing to heart problems than those who actually developed diagnosable heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly half of all the patients showed these early warning signs during the study, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 6.7 million Americans are living with heart failure, and it is the direct cause of approximately 8.5 percent of all deaths from heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Duke gastroenterologist and lead author Dr Kara Wegermann said: ‘Our findings point to the under diagnosis of HF and lack of recognition of diastolic dysfunction in patients with MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There is a real opportunity to develop better screening strategies so we can identify these patients earlier or even prevent symptomatic heart failure.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on their findings, the study authors strongly recommend implementing targeted heart screening for MASLD patients who are at the highest risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They specifically suggested that individuals who also have diabetes, high cholesterol, or are female should receive regular and proactive heart check-ups, which would allow doctors to detect heart failure much earlier in these vulnerable groups, leading to timelier intervention and better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

You use your plastic brush to lather a paste pushed from a plastic tube. When you have a cavity, you go to a dentist who might fill the hole with a plastic composite then sand it flush right there in your mouth. Say you grind your teeth at night. Your dentist might prescribe you a fitted piece of cured acrylic to grind into instead, the surface of which eventually gets visibly rough and worn. Perhaps your teeth are not very straight, so you contemplate getting aligners—thin sheets of thermoplastic that would be heated and then molded to the contours of your mouth and that you would need to wear almost constantly. The retainers you’d wear afterward to keep your newly straight teeth in place might also be plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly every part of modern dentistry and orthodontics involves—and is enhanced by—this remarkably useful material. In some cases, it’s part of necessary medical treatments: A cavity must be filled to prevent worse damage, and at least the plastic-glass composite filling your cavity won’t &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/mercury/mercury-dental-amalgam" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:leach mercury;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;leach mercury&lt;/a&gt;, like the silver fillings that were more common for prior generations. But in cases that are purely aesthetic—tooth straightening can fall into this category—the trade-offs may look different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/09/avoiding-microplastics-luxury/679939/?utm_source=yahoo-news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hands are wrung;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hands are wrung&lt;/a&gt; over the microplastics that pass from our tea bags and carpets and water bottles into our bodies, when it comes to oral health, we welcome plastic intentionally, and sometimes permanently, directly in our mouths. This troubles Adith Venugopal, an orthodontist and a senior lecturer in the Faculty of Dentistry at the University of Otago, New Zealand; he published a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-024-7465-x" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:letter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; in a dental journal last year raising concerns about the micro- and nanoplastics that slough off aligners and retainers. A robust body of research links chemical compounds that leak out of plastic to hormone disruption, developmental abnormalities, and cancer, but the effect of the actual fragments of plastic accumulating in our &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/hsc-newsroom-post-microplastics-testicular" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tissues;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tissues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11100893/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:organs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;organs&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl2746" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:less clear;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;less clear&lt;/a&gt;. Venugopal started researching microplastics in orthodontics after seeing a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:paper;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;paper &lt;/a&gt;that found patients with micro- and nanoplastics embedded in their artery plaques were more likely to have a heart attack or stroke. Plastic exposure from dentistry or orthodontics, Venugopal thinks, is ethically different than the worries over plastic exposure resulting from consumer choices. “Prescribing it from a medical standpoint, knowing that it would leach out and cause so many millions of particles to be ingested on a yearly basis, is troublesome, isn’t it?” he told me. “I mean, that’s the first thing, to do no harm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what the harm of dental and orthodontic plastics might be is, as of yet, poorly understood. Venugopal’s letter is one in a growing body of statements and studies coming out of those professions that ask if plastic may be harming patients. (“Microplastics: An Orthodontic Concern!” yelped an &lt;a href="https://www.jwfo.org/article/S2212-4438(24)00037-7/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:editorial;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the World Federation of Orthodontists&lt;/em&gt; last year.) So far, few if any papers have looked at the issue in humans, though preliminary studies &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ejo/article/47/3/cjaf014/8110795" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:attempt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;attempt&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969722084601" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:replicate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;replicate&lt;/a&gt; aspects of mouths in a lab, by simulating wear and tear from liquid and friction. The Nordic Institute of Dental Materials has been &lt;a href="https://www.niom.no/visiting-researcher-at-niom-investigating-microplastics-from-occlusal-device-materials.6716329-606094.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:looking into the release of microplastics from night guards;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;looking into the release of microplastics from night guards&lt;/a&gt;. The chief scientific officer of the American Dental Association’s research arm, Ben Wu, said in a statement that the association is “closely monitoring the scientific literature on microplastics” but that “no clinical evidence currently exists showing a meaningful oral or overall health impact from the particles.” The ADA’s best current advice to patients is to monitor their plastic dental devices for cracks, roughness, or breaks, and look into a replacement. Or, Wu suggested, instead of opting for clear plastic aligners, a person could get metal braces or retainers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Association of Orthodontists is taking a more proactive approach. “This is certainly something that is high in our consciousness,” Steven Siegel, the organization’s president, told me. The association recently convened a panel of researchers to look at all of the available studies to date, and has asked its awards committee to put out a call for proposals for new research in this area. It &lt;a href="https://www2.aaoinfo.org/aao-monitoring-research-regarding-microplastics-and-clear-aligners/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hasn’t taken an official position;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hasn’t taken an official position&lt;/a&gt; on microplastics, because the group, like Venugopal and the ADA, considers the available research to be “preliminary,” he said. But it believes microplastics are “an issue that we need to pay close attention to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clear orthodontic aligners have become a particular focus of early research attention, given the nature of their use. “They’re supposed to be worn about 22 hours a day for optimal tooth movement,” Venugopal told me. People typically change theirs out after one or two weeks and continue that cycle for months to years. A group of Italian researchers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969722084601" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a paper in 2023 that found that aligners did indeed leach microplastics after seven days when exposed to artificial saliva in a lab. But Venugopal points out that the lab study couldn’t capture the onslaught of enzymes, teeth gritting, and temperature variation that a real human mouth inflicts. So he and a doctoral student are now conducting what he believes is the first real-world study of how much microplastic leaches into saliva while an actual person is wearing aligners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is always the alternative that the ADA pointed to: metal braces. Although these may still use a small amount of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10981366/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plastic adhesive;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;plastic adhesive&lt;/a&gt; to bond the equipment to the front of a wearer’s teeth, at least the plastic isn’t on the chewing surface. (This doesn’t elide concerns entirely; &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/envhealth.3c00051" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one paper;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one paper&lt;/a&gt; has tried to characterize the microplastics sloughed off by orthodontic rubber bands. It may be a lot.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his own practice, instead of prescribing plastic retainers, which can be removed, Venugopal says he’s intentionally prescribing more fixed-wire retainers for people who would get a similar benefit from either. (Some patients would still benefit more from having thermoplastic molded ones, he said. But for those who could go either way, they’re getting metal.) “So, yes, it is affecting me as a clinician as well,” he said. If a patient were to ask him about microplastics, he would tell them what research has shown (that microplastics leak from objects such as aligners) and what it hasn’t (whether the leakage from an aligner or retainer alone poses a significant danger). “Without being informed about that, I don’t want to scare patients,” he said. Each of his patients—like everyone—is already inhaling, drinking, and eating microplastics just by living in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way to get us out of the dental-plastic loop will be to develop different materials. A plastic-bristled toothbrush may add approximately 30 to 120 microparticles of plastic to your diet with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749123021206" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:each brushing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;each brushing&lt;/a&gt;, according to one study. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026265X2502034X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Another;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Another&lt;/a&gt; put the estimate at an average of 39 particles a day. Either calculation suggests that a plastic toothbrush adds tens of thousands of particles to one’s yearly load of microplastics, which is significant when considering that &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.9b01517" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:estimates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; of microplastic exposure from food, air, and water put a person’s yearly particle load at more than 100,000. Nonplastic toothbrush options exist, but they’re hardly mainstream. Most dental floss is plastic, too—alternatives, such as silk floss, are mostly a health-food-store find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, not brushing your teeth would be a dental disaster, and no one should choose not to fill a cavity. The downside of an untreated cavity almost certainly far exceeds any hypothetical harm from additional microplastic exposure. “I was at a dental meeting a couple of months back, and I bit down and I fractured two molars, old fillings,” Siegel said. “And I went to my friend who’s an excellent dentist. I didn’t hesitate to have composite restorations with the materials that we use. I put it in that context: I think that the release, if any, of some of the compounds and microplastics is probably relatively minimal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for mouth guards: Siegel said he wasn’t aware of any material that could take the place of my acrylic set prescribed for tooth grinding. “Whether it’s crossing the street or having a medical procedure, one always looks at the risks and benefits,” Siegel told me. “I try and limit microplastic exposure in my own life. I try not to reheat things in plastic containers. I limit processed-food intake, things like that.” But, he said, when it comes to the health of your mouth, you want to ask yourself: Do the benefits of protecting your teeth and jaw outweigh the potential risks of adding to your microplastic dose? “For me personally, if I ground my teeth, I would wear a night guard,” he said. That was a sensible assessment, I thought, even if—for now—we don’t really have the information to base that decision on. Still, I got his point. I’ll pull mine out of storage tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/08/modern-dentistry-microplastic/683996/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Article originally published at The Atlantic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Article originally published at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 16:51:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE13WEx4cWxCZ1RfUDN2eEIwVTM4cVlDdEFQdUNEeHRuRVBqMk5kbHgtXzlUdXV5bEhRQ25JS0dHYWZhRXp5VzlrUEZNQ2NsZjZhOXQtMnEwelFydzYwbjl6MmFYU3hvelBrVDMxTklqZTdtTWw4TTVRMHZGZi0tVU0</guid></item><item><title>食肉细菌在佛罗里达州杀死第5人，感染激增至20例- WPEC</title><link>https://cbs12.com/news/local/flesh-eating-bacteria-kills-5th-person-in-florida-infections-surge-to-20-cases-in-weeks-oysters-seafood-florida-department-of-health-bacteria-seafood-infection-florida-august-25-2025</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (CBS12) — &lt;/span&gt;A surge in infections from the rare and deadly flesh-eating bacteria Vibrio vulnificus has claimed five lives in Florida this year, as cases have soared to 20 in just a matter of weeks, with one now in Martin County, as confirmed by the Florida Department of Health (FDOH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDOH reported that, so far in 2025, there have been twenty reported cases of infections caused by the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just over a month ago, CBS12 News reported that there were &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;11 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; of the infection with four deaths linked to the bacteria, showing a spike in just one month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most infections begin with the consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish, especially oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the CDC noted that open wounds can become infected if exposed to salt or brackish water that contains the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC&lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/132803" target="_blank" title="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/132803" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt; also highlighted&lt;/a&gt; concerns over extreme weather events like coastal floods, hurricanes, and storm surges. Such conditions can push coastal waters inland, increasing the risk of Vibrio infections for people—especially older adults or those with underlying health issues—who may come into contact with contaminated water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;a href="https://cbs12.com/news/local/local-non-profit-aims-to-reduce-cancer-death-rates-with-new-health-programs" target="_blank" title="https://cbs12.com/news/local/local-non-profit-aims-to-reduce-cancer-death-rates-with-new-health-programs" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Local non-profit opening free women's health care clinics for cancer screenings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is typically found in warm, salty waters like the Gulf of Mexico and nearby bays, per officials. The FDOH warns that higher concentrations of this bacterium occur when water temperatures rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDOH said that while infections from Vibrio vulnificus are rare, they can lead to severe health complications. Symptoms can include diarrhea, stomach cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills. The infections can be treated with antibiotics, but in serious cases, surgery may be necessary to remove damaged tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapid diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and recovery, and those with strong immune systems are at low risk of developing serious complications, per officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to FDOH, the confirmed deaths in Florida have been reported in these counties:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bay County - two deaths.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Broward County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hillsborough County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;St. Johns County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, confirmed cases have been reported in these counties:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collier County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dade County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Duval County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Escambia County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flagler&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lee County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manatee County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Martin County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Okaloosa County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;St. Johns County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Santa Rosa County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walton County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, FDOH reported that Florida had a total of 82 confirmed infections with 19 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrio bacteria are responsible for approximately 80,000 illnesses each year in the United States. The CDC reports around 150 to 200 infections annually, with a mortality rate of about 20% among those infected, often leading to death within one to two days after symptoms arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find more ways to stay up to date with your latest local news. &lt;a href="https://cbs12.com/sign-up" target="_blank" title="https://cbs12.com/sign-up" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Sign up for our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to get the day's top headlines delivered right to your inbox. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CBS12NewsWPEC" target="_blank" title="https://www.youtube.com/@CBS12NewsWPEC" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Subscribe to our YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; for the biggest stories and can't miss video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WPEC</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 16:49:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgJBVV95cUxPNm93YVJOa1JrRk1YRF9iZ2RpVkpXbXVGWThEZzFvLW1BTlhZanYxVVVQclNjOEQ2QnU2TzU3aWV3c1pLZ2RQbkh5bXNLWWEzVkVqVkhZYnRXZTRMT3BObVFYbFdkbTVWcUt6QjdfbjR4SVFTZnNmMFJLWnhwXy05YnpOSHlXbEg4MDBnbU1lYjlVVEdHNjZ4TmM5UmtkRlJ1b0dSNTFqTjN6MGc0ZUhaWE5zQVplVldwdklTUTU0UjlZNUl1ZXdBT29sTlNBaXV0R25tanVLOE5pZkJ0ZnBJbGZOZGhZcmtqT0xXYjcyS2VfV0dHeUJTZGRjZEdoRERwNmhGbHJRUWRZQURUT1FSRjg4bkhRbWRMQlJXaVdzVXVIWUtlcVJSQVBPZlo4WmZZR3ZCUHhR</guid></item><item><title>科学家进行首例猪-人肺移植-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/health/lung-transplant-pig-human.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 16:02:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE01QWNqbk9lWkt6cnozNHR2R245Si1KdFJGRm9YZmlvRjBYVG5oNGdtRlpxWm1kakM2UTFvQlNFa3g2MkU5SThBcXZ3Z3lRT0g0SHVEcmgzWDBwdkNUTEhjLVp2eXNDdVUxY1ZIU2Q4bG5QU21NSTFIZ1QzMzQ</guid></item><item><title>我在Mounjaro丢了9块石头，但被毁容的副作用击中-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15018207/stone-Mounjaro-effect-teeth-weight-loss-jabs-doctor.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Hope Lancaster Colquhoun was sent photos of her sister's wedding, where she was a bridesmaid, she should have been thrilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the 42-year-old, who lives in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, could hardly bear to open the file. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, the 'defeated' mum of one, who weighed around 18 stone, was filled with dread at how 'heavy' she would look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So when, months later, she was diagnosed with &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-616e8090-7ea9-11f0-8959-afc9205461e6"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, prescribed Mounjaro and instantly shed the pounds, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-2d71d720-7dea-11f0-9bd7-992ec2de9cd1" class=""&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; jab felt like a 'lifeline'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dropping nine stone and going from a size 22 to a size 8 in the space of just a year, she looked 'like a totally new person'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her weight, however, wasn't the only dramatic change she noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As I ran my tongue against the top of my mouth, I felt a sharp, jagged edge,' the influencer, who is originally from Texas in the US, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I looked in the mirror and was left horrified as not one, but multiple, of my teeth had completely snapped in half.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hope Lancaster Colquhoun (pictured with her husband Dean Colquhoun) had two rows of broken teeth after losing nine stone from taking a weight loss jab&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hope Lancaster Colquhoun says she was nervous about looking at photos of herself at her sister's wedding and was filled with dread at how 'heavy' she would look&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a panic, she arranged an emergency appointment with a dentist who told her that at least seven of her teeth would have to be pulled out immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I sat in the chair, feeling sick to my stomach, as they yanked my natural teeth away,' she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My gnashers before were perfect and I was really proud of my natural smile. I never had any dental work and kept up with my dental hygiene more than most people I knew.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many on the jabs, Ms Lancaster Colquhoun had experienced side-effects including nausea and indigestion, but noticed no debilitating impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Doctors think it's because I've lost so much weight in such a short frame of time,' she explains.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 1.5 million patients in the UK are now paying for private Mounjaro prescriptions, as well as a similar drug called Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But increasingly, users are experiencing a surprising and distressing effect of what are known medically as GLP-1 drugs: tooth decay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Receding or sensitive gums, yellowing teeth, bad breath, gum disease and even tooth loss are among the distressing symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Months after starting on the jabs, Hope suddenly noticed her teeth were cracked. In a panic, she arranged an emergency appointment with a dentist who told her at least seven of her teeth would have to immediately be pulled out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mounjaro is a GLP-1 drug. Jab users have told how they have lost teeth and developed cavities and gum inflammation weeks after beginning the medication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In online forums, jab users have also told how they lost teeth and developed cavities and gum inflammation weeks after beginning the medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to dental experts, who have seen a rise in what they dub 'Ozempic teeth', this is in part the result of acid reflux caused by the injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The jabs make people feel full by slowing down the rate of digestion, which can lead to food remaining in the stomach for longer periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The longer it sits, the higher the risk of stomach acid &lt;span&gt;refluxing into the mouth - weakening and dissolving the enamel and making teeth more susceptible to decay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are medications including proton pump inhibitors (PPI), like omeprazole, that can be taken to relieve acid reflux, but these should not be taken regularly in the long term. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts have also suggested a lack of saliva, triggered by using the jabs, could be the culprit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Edward Li, principal dentist and co-founder at The a.b.c Smile in London, told the Daily Mail: 'GLP-1 drugs slow the emptying of the stomach, which can increase reflux and nausea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When acid repeatedly washes into the mouth, enamel is softened and gradually worn away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The 42-year-old lost a staggering nine stone for her own wedding day, using the weight loss drug Mounjaro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This can raise the risk of sensitivity and cavities, but on its own is unlikely to cause a tooth to be lost unless there were already significant dental problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A more likely explanation is dry mouth, or xerostomia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These drugs dampen appetite and often reduce the sensation of thirst. Patients commonly drink less water and produce less saliva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Saliva is vital for protecting teeth: it neutralises acid, carries minerals to repair early enamel damage, and contains immune defences against bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Without it, plaque builds up and gum disease can progress much faster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Reports of “Ozempic mouth” or “Ozempic teeth” are increasingly being seen in our clinic, reflecting this.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who lose teeth while taking drugs may also have had 'underlying gum disease, weakened enamel or a genetic predisposition', he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In such cases, the added stress of dry mouth or acid exposure may tip the balance, pushing already compromised teeth past the point of saving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Rapid changes in body weight, whether drug-induced or not, can have side-effects of their own. Nutritional gaps, especially in protein and minerals, may reduce the resilience of both bone and gum tissue. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This does not mean the injections directly cause tooth loss, but that the pace and physiology of weight loss may make pre-existing dental problems worse.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Equally, jab users may be more susceptible to dental issues because they're failing to eat a balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Rizwan Mahmood, a private dentist at London clinic Ruh Dental, 'eating less can also mean fewer nutrients like calcium and vitamin D - essentials for healthy teeth and gums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're seeing more inflammation and gum issues in patients using these medications, especially if they're not eating a balanced diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also told the Daily Mail: 'GLP-1 patients&lt;span&gt; often opt for softer, more processed foods which, if not counterbalanced with good hygiene, can quickly lead to plaque build-up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While these medications are highly effective, they can inadvertently create conditions that harm oral health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14277797/Ultra-processed-food-blamed-flaw-childrens-development.html"&gt;has also suggested&lt;/a&gt; a diet high in soft and hyper-palatable processed foods may reduce facial muscle strength and trigger teeth issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But regularly chewing solid and fibrous foods exercises the jaw, helping to prevent &lt;span&gt;deficiencies in the size and shape of dental arches.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So devastating is the impact of the crippling dental side-effect that one patient has even filed a lawsuit against Mounjaro manufacturer Eli Lilly and Ozempic manufacturer Novo Nordisk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Attorneys for Jaclyn Bjorklund, from Louisiana, who had used both injections, claimed she was diagnosed with a condition called gastroparesis after using the jabs, which caused her to vomit so much that some of her teeth fell out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others have taken to social media forums to share their concerns over their rapidly declining dental health while on the jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one Reddit thread with more than 149,000 users, a user wrote: 'In the last week I have developed a bad inflammation on my gums. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'On some teeth I feel like the gum is receding or shrinking because I can see and feel the tooth necks which look orange.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another said: 'Since starting my journey, I’ve lost 80 pounds in five months. Has anyone noticed that since starting you are more prone to tooth decay or cavities!? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’ve always had cavities every so often but I can count at least six right now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Ms Lancaster Colquhoun, the debilitating side-effect has seen her shell out more than £3,700 to fix her teeth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But despite now needing dentures for life, she insists that taking the weight loss jab has saved her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’d encourage people to consider the jab because of how life-changing it’s been for me,' she said.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Responding to Ms Lancaster Colquhoun's tale, Eli Lilly said: 'Patient safety is Lilly’s top priority, and we take any reports regarding patient safety extremely seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Regulatory agencies conduct extensive independent assessments of the benefits and risks of every new medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Lilly is committed to continually monitoring, evaluating and reporting safety data to ensure the latest information is available for regulators and prescribers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It is also important to know the tell-tale signs of a brain tumour to help catch in its early stages &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now evidence of a potential increased risk of malignant brain tumours adds urgency to shift the focus from short-term recovery to lifelong vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This underscores the importance of long-term monitoring for anyone with a history of a traumatic brain injury.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers divided 75,000 adults who had suffered a traumatic brain injury into three categories: mild, moderate and severe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mild included concussion, while falls and car crashes came under moderate and severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other 75,000 study participants had no history of traumatic brain injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found 87 volunteers in the moderate or severe group developed brain tumours within three to five years of injury—far higher than the mild or control group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sandro Marini, a neurologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and study co-author, added: 'While there is an increased risk of tumor from a traumatic brain injury, the overall risk remains low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Still, brain tumor is a devastating disease and often gets detected in later stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

There is much more work required and we are not on the dawn of an era of lung xenotransplantation using pig lungs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Xenotransplantation has become a hot area of research in recent years, with the heart, kidneys and liver among the organs that have been transplanted into humans from pigs. The latter are typically genetically modified by removing certain pig genes and inserting specific human genes, to reduce rejection of the organs by the recipient’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Studies are often initially carried out on brain dead human recipients before, in some cases, being used in living patients. While there have been only a handful of living recipients, many have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/01/pig-heart-transplant-faucette-dies" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;died within weeks or months&lt;/a&gt; of such surgery, albeit not necessarily from complications relating to the transplant. However, &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/health/xenotransplant-pig-kidney-patient" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;some with transplanted pig kidneys have survived&lt;/a&gt; with the organs still functioning several months after the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But experts say xenotransplantation using lungs is particularly tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Every breath you breathe in is bringing the external environment into the body,” said Fisher. This means the lungs need to be very capable of responding to attacks from pollution, infection and other sources. “So the immune system in the lung is very sensitive and very active, which means when you’re dealing with organ transplantation, where you know you don’t want the immune system to be very active, it poses extra challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03861-x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Writing in the journal Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, researchers in China reported how they transplanted the left lung from a Chinese Bama Xiang donor pig with six genetic modifications into a 39-year-old brain dead male recipient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team found the lung remained viable and functional over a 216-hour period and did not trigger hyperacute rejection – a rapid, violent immune response by the recipient’s body. There were also no signs of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, 24 hours after transplantation the lung showed signs of fluid accumulation and damage, possibly initially due to transplant-related inflammation. And despite the recipient being given powerful immunosuppressive medication, the transplanted organ was progressively attacked by antibodies, resulting in significant damage over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The impact of the damage was likely underestimated [because] the human recipient still had one of their own lungs present and this would have compensated for the damaged porcine lung,” said Fisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Peter Friend, from the University of Oxford, said the results were complicated by the fact brain death itself causes an acute inflammatory state. “So some of what they are seeing may be a function of the brain dead status of the recipient,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers behind the work said the approach needed to be refined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Continued efforts are needed to optimise immunosuppressive regimens, refine genetic modifications, enhance lung preservation strategies and assess long-term graft function beyond the acute phase,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Friend said other approaches to increasing the availability of organs were being investigated, including remodelling donor organs using stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some research groups are also exploring the possibility of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/sep/07/humanised-kidneys-grown-inside-pigs-for-the-first-time" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;growing humanised organs inside pigs or sheep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Fisher added that while xenotransplantation for lungs held promise, another promising avenue was to treat human donor lungs deemed to be unsuitable for transplantation so they could be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If we get that right, that’s something can be implemented within months, and certainly in years could be making very big differences,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPdWpUMnJpTmhGblh4ZnhBb0hZNzJwb2wzS05CRDBxOXUxY3Y0ZlRueVMzQ285Q0hmRmx5QUN3R3pmVU5fRFh3bVBDRGsxZ1lpaDJXYkZIQjRVdGhFc0tkWU1tc3BMSGI1V0hiYkM1ZEtfNkJkb0dud3VTQ3ZDazRnTG5VQWxaLU5UUm9xdk5RaDh3R2M4aF9DUi1aTDZiVm54eGR2b19GZHFlOFJweF91ZGRSbC1TdnVVcl9GU2M3eFc</guid></item><item><title>洞穴鱼是如何一次又一次失去眼睛的- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/how-the-cavefish-lost-its-eyes-again-and-again/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Riddle thinks these carotenoids may be another adaptation to suppress inflammation, which might be important in the wild, as cavefish are likely overeating whenever food arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies by Krishnan, Rohner, and colleagues published in 2020 and 2022 have found other adaptations that seem to help tamp down inflammation. Cavefish cells produce lower levels of certain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-020-1234-2"&gt;molecules called cytokines that promote inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.74539"&gt;lower levels of reactive oxygen species&lt;/a&gt; — tissue-damaging byproducts of the body’s metabolism that are often elevated in people with obesity or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krishnan is investigating this further, hoping to understand how the well-fed cavefish remain healthy. Rohner, meanwhile, is increasingly interested in how cavefish survive not just overeating, but long periods of starvation, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No waste&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more fundamental level, researchers still hope to figure out why the Mexican tetra evolved into cave forms while any number of other Mexican river fish that also regularly end up in caves did not. (Globally, there are more than 200 cave-adapted fish species, but species that also still have populations on the surface are quite rare.) “Presumably, there is something about the tetras’ genetic makeup that makes it easier for them to adapt,” says Riddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though cavefish are now well-established lab animals used in research and are easy to purchase for that purpose, preserving them in the wild will be important to safeguard the lessons they still hold for us. “There are hundreds of millions of the surface fish,” says Rohner, but cavefish populations are smaller and more vulnerable to pressures like pollution and people drawing water from caves during droughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Riddle’s students, David Perez Guerra, is now involved in a committee to support cavefish conservation. And researchers themselves are increasingly careful, too. “The tissues of the fish collected during our lab’s last field trip benefited nine different labs,” Riddle says. “We wasted nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;

lowered the risk of dementia by at least 35% in people with two copies of the APOE4 gene, a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We followed over 5,700 people for 34 years and found those who followed a baseline Mediterranean diet with little alcohol, red and processed meat but full of vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, fish and olive oil all reduced the risk of dementia,” said Yuxi Liu, lead author of the Mass General Brigham study published Monday in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03891-5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:journal Nature;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;journal Nature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But the benefit was highest for people with the APOE4 gene, especially those with two copies of APOE4,” said Liu, a research fellow in medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. “Not only did following a baseline Mediterranean diet reduce the probability of developing dementia by 35% in people with two APOE4 genes, but higher adherence to the diet further reduced their risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another major finding of the study: People with the APOE4 gene appear to have distinctive metabolic profiles that dramatically respond to healthy nutrients in the Mediterranean diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic processes such as nutrient digestion, energy production, and the building and repairing of nerves and tissues of the body and brain are highly dependent on the quality of vitamins, enzymes, amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids (fats) in a healthy diet, Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Improving the metabolic function in people with APOE4 through diet might explain, or at least partially explain, the huge fall in dementia risk we saw in our study,” she said. “Of course, we need future studies to further validate that concept.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a “stop the presses” finding, said neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida who conducts studies on cognitive improvement in people who are genetically at risk for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully this will change the current dogma that having two copies of the APOE4 is a ‘fait accompli’ for developing Alzheimer’s,” said Isaacson, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Genes do not have to be your destiny,” he added. “If the risk of dementia in a person in the highest risk category can be cut by 35% just by following a specific diet, imagine what can be done when you work on dozens of modifiable risk factors such as exercise, sleep, stress and the like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The Mediterranean diet is plant-based with little red meat or sweets and incorporates daily exercise and socialization. - Monticello/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Healthy behaviors and dementia risk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first study to find a link between the Mediterranean and other plant-based diets and dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/13/health/mediterranean-diet-dementia-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:large study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;large study&lt;/a&gt; of over 60,000 people in the United Kingdom in 2023 found those who stuck most closely to a Mediterranean diet had up to a 23% lower risk for dementia compared with people who didn’t follow the diet well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another 2023 study that looked at brain tissue &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/08/health/alzheimers-mediterranean-mind-diet-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:echoed these findings;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;echoed these findings&lt;/a&gt;. People who consumed foods from the plant-based Mediterranean and &lt;a href="http://cnn.com/2015/06/23/health/gallery/mind-diet?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain-focused MIND diets;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain-focused MIND diets&lt;/a&gt; had almost 40% lower odds of having the hallmark signs of Alzheimer’s — sticky beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain — when autopsied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not all. Adding just one food category from either diet — such as eating recommended amounts of vegetables or fruits — reduced amyloid buildup in the brain to a level similar to being about four years younger, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIND diet is short for Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay. This diet sticks to the Mediterranean diet but recommends specific amounts of known brain-healthy foods such as dark leafy greens and berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s when individuals take lifestyle changes to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/18/health/alzheimers-blood-brain-improvement-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the next level;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the next level&lt;/a&gt; that the most benefit is seen, according to Isaacson. A patient in his clinical trial, Simon Nicholls, reduced his risk of developing Alzheimer’s via lifestyle changes including diet, exercise, reducing stress and optimizing sleep, along with a few strategically chosen supplements and medications. Nicholls, who has two copies of the APOE4 gene, dramatically changed his exercise and eating habits and within a year had reduced the amount of amyloid and tau in his blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more startling: Brain volume scans showed that the hippocampus, the tiny seahorse-shaped organ responsible for memory, had actually grown in volume in Nicholls’ brain since he started the intervention. Nicholls continues to maintain his healthy lifestyle and has continued to improve, Isaacson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Possible future loss of study data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study followed men and women between the ages of 55 and 75 who were part of the &lt;a href="https://nurseshealthstudy.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nurse’s Health Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nurse’s Health Study&lt;/a&gt;, started in 1976 to investigate women’s nutritional risk factors for chronic disease, and the &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/health-professionals/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Health Professionals Follow-Up Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Health Professionals Follow-Up Study&lt;/a&gt;, which has chronicled the health and diet of men since 1986.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary data, along with DNA, blood, urine, stool and tissue samples from both studies, have enabled researchers like Liu to make major advances in science — the discovery of the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8094827/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dangers of trans fats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dangers of trans fats&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent ban from the US food supply; the link between &lt;a href="https://www.bcrf.org/blog/investigating-breast-cancer-dr-walter-willett/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity and breast cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity and breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, even in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20460303/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:adolescents;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;adolescents&lt;/a&gt;; and the connection between &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3683458/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cigarette smoking and heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cigarette smoking and heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, federal funding for both studies &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/08/health/harvard-biodata-trump-cuts-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:has been stopped;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;has been stopped&lt;/a&gt; due to the Trump administration’s ongoing feud with Harvard University.

Credit - Jan Sonnenmair—Getty Images&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;exas health officials on Aug. 18 &lt;a href="https://time.com/7310528/measles-texas-outbreak/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:declared the end of a measles outbreak;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;declared the end of a measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; that had sickened more than 760 people across the state and killed two children. Doctors and public-health officials involved in the outbreak, most of whom had previously never encountered a measles patient, are now taking stock of what they’ve learned about the virus and the best ways to prevent and control outbreaks of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles, they say, is as contagious as feared, and unvaccinated people are the most vulnerable. But while vaccination remains the best way to prevent measles, Texas public-health officials say they could have adopted a more inclusive approach when engaging with vaccine-hesitant communities about the virus and its risks. More investment is also needed, they say, into building trust between rural communities and health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights should be taken to heart as measles cases continue to rise in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, say public-health experts who fear that measles may now be here to stay. More than 1,300 measles cases have been reported nationally this year, the highest number since the disease was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though the Texas outbreak looks to be under control, we’re still seeing a lot of cases,” says Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. “The measles situation is not over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some lessons learned from the Texas measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measles is as dangerous, contagious, and vaccine-preventable as expected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What surprised me was how textbook measles is,” says Katherine Wells, the public health director of Lubbock, Texas, where many measles patients were treated during the recent outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells has been in public health for almost 25 years and had never before seen a measles case. But as patients streamed into Lubbock’s hospitals and clinics, a clear clinical pattern—which Wells had learned about in the medical literature—emerged. Unvaccinated people with measles first develop a runny nose and conjunctivitis, then a high fever and rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease also proved to be as contagious as feared. In Lubbock, an unvaccinated child became ill with the virus after sitting in the same waiting room as someone with measles, Wells says. “Seeing those cases on the ground confirmed what was in the books.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7294477/former-cdc-rfk-wrong-vaccines/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Former CDC Director: RFK Jr. is Dangerously Wrong about Vaccines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Former CDC Director: RFK Jr. is Dangerously Wrong about Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one in five measles cases are severe, says Dr. Leila Myrick, a family medicine and obstetrics physician in Seminole, Texas, who treated more than 20 people with measles this year, most of them children. Several of Myrick’s patients developed pneumonia and required breathing treatments including supplemental oxygen, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost 100 people, mostly children, were hospitalized in Texas because of complications from measles. Most people who have contracted measles in the U.S. this year have been unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the outbreak, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. downplayed the risk of measles, &lt;a href="https://nation.foxnews.com/watch/d5c0ee929861616db083854daa058a56/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:saying in a Fox News interview;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;saying in a Fox News interview&lt;/a&gt; in March that it’s “very, very difficult for measles to kill a healthy person.” The two children in Texas who died from the disease were unvaccinated but had no preexisting conditions, officials have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is not a little cold. It can cause very high fever that can become very rapidly life-threatening,” said Richard Plemper, a Georgia State University biomedical scientist whose lab is developing an antiviral treatment for the virus family that includes measles. There is currently no approved treatment for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 0.1% of measles cases in developed countries are fatal, Plemper says. “Yes, that’s a small number, but if it’s your child, what comfort is that? Measles is vaccine-preventable. In a country like the U.S., nobody has to die from measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public-health experts say there is still more to learn about the disease’s longer-term effects on patients who have recovered. Measles can cause yearslong “immune amnesia,” in which the body forgets how to fight other infections. In very rare cases, the disease can also cause a deadly type of brain inflammation that strikes several years after the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Better testing and wastewater surveillance can hinder disease spread&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the Texas outbreak, measles testing was a major hurdle, state public-health officials say. It took up to a week for test results to come back, which stymied efforts to curb the spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until about six weeks into the outbreak that testing capabilities improved, and people were able to get test results the next day, says Wells, the Lubbock public-health director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7290566/wastewater-tracking-measles/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Wastewater surveillance for measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Wastewater surveillance for measles&lt;/a&gt; could also have been instituted earlier, public-health experts say. Such testing, which was started midway through the Texas outbreak, can flag the presence of a disease even before people come forward with symptoms. Recently in Idaho, &lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/messages/pandemic-center-tracking-report-12768792" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wastewater surveillance detected measles activity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;wastewater surveillance detected measles activity&lt;/a&gt; at least a week before the state’s first case in 30 years was reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pushing vaccination is important—but so is meeting people ‘where they are’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas outbreak started in a Mennonite community in Gaines County where vaccination rates are low. State health officials say they pushed hard to get people in the community vaccinated, setting up mobile vaccine clinics and educating people on the safety and efficacy of the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, more than 300 people in the county were vaccinated as part of this campaign, says Zach Holbrooks, executive director of the South Plains Public Health District, which includes Gaines County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But officials said they could have done a better job at providing not just vaccines but also information and other resources that could have helped families that chose not to vaccinate and had sick kids at home. Many children showed up to the hospital with dehydration, for instance, and could have benefited from information on the importance of keeping children hydrated, Wells says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/6981222/public-health-measles-history/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Public Health Community Needs to Tell the Whole Truth About the History of Measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Public Health Community Needs to Tell the Whole Truth About the History of Measles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services said in an email that in future outbreaks, it would continue to share information about the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, but it might also introduce more general messaging that does not focus on vaccines, such as when people with measles symptoms should seek emergency care, sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have to meet people where they are,” says Lori Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, which represents local health departments across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman says that building trust with communities—and doing so before an emergency strikes—is indispensable. “Our work is only as successful as our ability to partner with communities,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;People do listen to official advice, and the quality of that advice matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas outbreak demonstrated that the public does heed official recommendations, says Plemper of Georgia State University, and highlights the heavy responsibility that health leaders shoulder when doling out advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://time.com/7263882/measles-vaccine-rfk-jr-vitamin-a/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:repeatedly;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; said that supplementing with vitamin A could effectively treat measles. Vitamin A is not an approved measles treatment, and while some research has shown that people with vitamin A deficiencies can get sicker from the disease, there is no evidence that people who aren’t deficient will benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking too much vitamin A, however, can cause organ damage.

But it has also made several appearances in California within the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A plague case was reported in El Dorado County in 2020, and two other cases were &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-plague-yosemite-20150819-story.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported in California in 2015&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suspected to have been caused by bites from an infected flea or rodent in Yosemite National Park. All three patients received treatment and made a full recovery, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though medical advancements have made the deadly disease treatable, it hasn’t been eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s more from experts on why the plague is still around and how dangerous it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="how-the-plague-is-contracted" class="subhead"&gt;How the plague is contracted&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plague is caused by the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Yersinia pestis &lt;/i&gt;and primarily affects small animals or rodents in the United States, Swartzberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can spread to humans and pets from the bite of an infected flea or from coming into close contact with or handling an infected rodent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three types of the plague:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bubonic plague, with the trademark swollen lymph nodes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Septicemic plague, when the infection spreads throughout the body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pneumonic plague, which infects the lungs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 80% of plague cases in the U.S. have been in the bubonic form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principal source of plague in Los Angeles County is wild rodents in rural areas. Woodland creatures that could carry the disease and should be avoided include chipmunks, wood rats, mice and marmots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who do contract the plague do so while hiking or camping in these areas and are unknowingly bitten by an infected flea, said Ashok Chopra, professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Texas Medical Branch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="where-the-plague-could-be-contracted-in-socal" class="subhead"&gt;Where the plague could be contracted in SoCal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials say the plague occurs in foothills, plateaus, mountains and along the coast but is largely absent from the southeastern desert region and the Central Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Areas in Los Angeles County with the highest risk are the rural recreational and wilderness areas of the Angeles National Forest and San Gabriel Mountains, county officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People and their pets can get the plague if they visit or live in areas where wild rodents are naturally infected, according to the Los Angeles County Public Health Department. People who live in close contact with rats also are at greater risk of getting the disease from the possibly infected rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="why-the-plague-has-stuck-around" class="subhead"&gt;Why the plague has stuck around&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there have been several vaccine candidates to ward off the plague, there aren’t any Food and Drug Administration-approved inoculations for the disease, Chopra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease also isn’t a top priority for infectious-disease experts or public health officials because it’s under control. It is still extremely uncommon and infects on average seven people in the U.S. per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plague can be treated with antibiotics, and if we get treatment in a timely manner, there’s little to fear, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if left untreated, it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="todays-top-stories" class="subhead"&gt;Today’s top stories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-08-24/supreme-court-reasonable-suspicion-border-agents-latino-arrests" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0fe1f81/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/320x213!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f1d8b37/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/568x379!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e865df6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/768x512!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/14eb28c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/1024x683!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/410483a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/1200x800!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="People in military uniforms with their faces covered are walking." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f09d7a0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/320x213!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f86bdaa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/568x379!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/19a5892/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/768x512!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9604d63/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/1024x683!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/651fbce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/651fbce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Masked people in Border Patrol uniforms gather in downtown Los Angeles while Gov.

But the industry now says the increase is untenable as it faces a sharp decline in revenue and unfair competition from the growing illicit market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An industry-sponsored bill moving through the Legislature would eliminate the tax increase — and the resulting loss in revenue would cut millions in funding for subsidized child care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-else-is-going-on" class="subhead"&gt;What else is going on&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id="this-mornings-must-reads" class="subhead"&gt;This morning’s must reads&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="other-must-reads" class="subhead"&gt;Other must reads&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 id="for-your-downtime" class="subhead"&gt;For your downtime&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/food/list/best-happy-hour-guide-los-angeles-new-and-affordable"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/34f4bd3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/320x240!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c8126b7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/568x426!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/299b774/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/768x576!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a36457/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/1024x768!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6916fcd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/1200x900!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="Two cocktails." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7514fa1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/320x240!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1f9f34d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/568x426!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8fff31c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/768x576!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1666a55/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/1024x768!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6383767/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/1200x900!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6383767/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/1200x900!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;A dirty martini and a Hippies in Paris cocktail are offered on the Apero Hour menu at CouCou in West Hollywood. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Jenn Harris / Los Angeles Times )&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="going-out" class="subhead"&gt;Going out&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 id="staying-in" class="subhead"&gt;Staying in&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-question-for-you-what-are-your-favorite-places-to-eat-and-drink-in-the-san-fernando-valley" class="subhead"&gt;A question for you: What are your favorite places to eat and drink in the San Fernando Valley?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shannon Yates&lt;/b&gt; writes, “My favorite place to eat in the Valley is the Country Deli in Chatsworth.

    &lt;p&gt;Seattle-area hospitals and emergency departments are again facing a summer surge of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In King County, recent rates of ER visits, positive tests, hospitalizations and some wastewater data all point to the same conclusion, one that reminds us this respiratory virus still behaves differently from many other seasonal pathogens, said Dr. Eric Chow, chief of communicable disease epidemiology and immunization for Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While common respiratory viruses like influenza or RSV generally circulate more widely during winter, COVID has continued to hit many parts of the country during the summer. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recent forecasting model, &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/why-covid-is-spreading-again-this-summer/" class="content-link"&gt;infections are rising in most states&lt;/a&gt;, though this wave has so far proved milder than those in prior years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not a surprise to us,” Chow said. “We’ve been seeing increases of COVID-19 around this time for the past several years. But I think it can catch people off guard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In King County, increases in emergency visits have been most dramatic among children under 4, Chow said. Children can still experience severe symptoms from COVID, especially kids who aren’t old enough to be vaccinated, underscoring the importance of parents getting vaccinated, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years after the country declared a national public health emergency, scientists are still not entirely sure what’s behind the summer spikes. Some health experts &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/why-covid-is-spreading-again-this-summer/" class="content-link"&gt;hypothesize&lt;/a&gt; summer travel and crowds contribute to the spread, or that immunity to the virus — either from vaccination or illness the prior winter — can fade by July and August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health epidemiologist Dr. Scott Lindquist isn’t fully convinced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the million-dollar question,” Lindquist said. “I would have thought we’d have an answer, or at least see COVID become a seasonal respiratory virus, but we are just not seeing that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while COVID persists in causing deaths and severe illness, we’re no longer seeing the huge peaks and valleys from early in the pandemic, Lindquist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not Earth-shattering, like it used to be,” he said. “What we’re talking about are very mild increases. I don’t want to dismiss that, because people still die of COVID. But it’s just not the same place we were.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington, about 1.4% of hospital emergency visits in early August were due to COVID, according to the &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/data-and-statistical-reports/diseases-and-chronic-conditions/communicable-disease-surveillance-data/respiratory-illness-data-dashboard" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;state Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;. That’s up from about 0.5% in June, but lower than ER rates this time last year and the year before, which were above 2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults are still hospitalized and seek emergency care for COVID at higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 1.8% of King County emergency visits — or about 290 visits — were due to COVID the week of Aug. 10 according to &lt;a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/respiratory-virus-data" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between October, when the state starts tracking respiratory disease season, and early August, about 475 people in Washington died from COVID, according to DOH. During the 2023-2024 season, almost 1,100 residents had died by this point in the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is promising,” Chow said. “It’s a reminder why immunity is so important. Thanks to a highly effective and safe vaccine, and also the fact that some people have had previous infection, this is probably why severe disease burden has decreased over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he said, “there is a portion of our population where COVID-19 health threats are still very real,” including among immunocompromised people and children too young to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There hasn’t been evidence that any one SARS-CoV-2 variant is fueling these increases in cases and hospitalizations in Washington state, Lindquist said. Multiple strains are competing with each other nationwide and here, including the newer NB.1.8.1, LP.8.1 and XFG, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as there are people who are vulnerable to getting infections, the virus will continue to evolve and breed new variants, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s also harder to know which variants are responsible for the most cases now, since not every sample is sent off to labs to be tested and sequenced, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, state and local health experts hope the late-summer surge will remind people to take more precautions against COVID, especially as indoor gatherings become more popular and students return to school. That includes masking in crowds, staying home when sick, increasing indoor air ventilation and getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are lessons we’ve already learned,” Lindquist said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bumps in cases and hospitalizations emerge as the country awaits clarity from the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC on which COVID vaccines will be available, and to which age groups, this fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shots approved for the 2024-2025 year — this past year — still provide good protection from serious illness and death from COVID, Chow said. But updated versions of the vaccine for the coming fall have yet to be approved by the FDA for certain age groups, which is weighing on the minds of many parents, including Chow, who has a 4-month-old daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t give her a vaccine right now because she’s too young, but by the time she is eligible, will she even have a vaccine that’s available for her?” he said. “It’s certainly a big question on my mind.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;At 60, you still feel mostly invincible. Sure, recovery takes longer after that weekend tennis match, and you've started holding restaurant menus at arm's length. But 80? That's another planet, barely visible from where you stand. Here's what geriatricians know that you don't: the choices you make right now—not next year, not after retirement—are writing the script for whether you'll be traveling at 80 or trapped at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research is both terrifying and liberating. While genetics loads the gun, your choices pull the trigger. The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8821855/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;major determinants of healthy aging&lt;/a&gt; aren't in your DNA but in three specific decisions that create a cascade effect over twenty years. These aren't expensive biohacks or exotic treatments. They're available to almost everyone. Yet most people ignore them, believing decline is as inevitable as taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research tracking why some 80-year-olds seem like they're 60 while others at 60 already seem 80 reveals the answer isn't in medicine cabinets or DNA tests. It's in three fundamental choices that, when made at 60, compound over two decades into either independence or dependence, vitality or frailty, engagement or isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Start lifting heavy things—your future mobility depends on it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without intervention, you'll lose &lt;a href="https://utswmed.org/medblog/age-related-sarcopenia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;30% of your muscle mass between 60 and 80&lt;/a&gt;. Let that sink in. Nearly a third of your physical strength, gone. This isn't about vanity or beach bodies. This is about whether you can get off the floor after playing with grandchildren, carry your own luggage, or recover from a fall without breaking a hip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1990, Dr. Maria Fiatarone Singh's groundbreaking research took nursing home residents aged 86-96 and put them through eight weeks of high-intensity resistance training. The results stunned the medical community: &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2342214/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;strength gains averaged 174%, with 9% muscle growth&lt;/a&gt;—essentially reversing a decade of decline. These were people in nursing homes, not athletes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what researchers emphasize: starting at 80 is like learning calculus when you can't do algebra. At 60, your body still eagerly responds to training. Your nervous system adapts, your hormones cooperate, your joints forgive. Wait until 80, and you're not just weak—you're metabolically broken, balance-impaired, and terrified of movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/how-can-strength-training-build-healthier-bodies-we-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that strength training at 60 changes your entire biological trajectory. Muscle isn't just for movement—it's your metabolic furnace, your glucose sink, your armor against falls. The people thriving at 80 aren't just the yoga devotees or marathon runners (though those help). They're the ones who learned to love the weight room at 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prescription isn't complicated: twice weekly, 8-10 exercises, progressing from moderate to challenging effort. We're not talking about becoming Arnold. We're talking about becoming someone who never needs help getting out of a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Protect your social connections like your life depends on it—because it does&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25910392/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Social isolation kills as reliably as smoking&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Julianne Holt-Lunstad's meta-analysis of 148 studies covering 300,000 people found that loneliness and social isolation increase mortality risk by 26-32%. At 60, you're still socially rich: work relationships, family obligations, community ties. By 80, without deliberate cultivation, your world can shrink to medical appointments and whoever delivers groceries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Academies report found &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25663/social-isolation-and-loneliness-in-older-adults-opportunities-for-the" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one-quarter of adults over 65&lt;/a&gt; are socially isolated. But isolation doesn't suddenly appear at 65—it's cultivated through a thousand small retreats starting at 60. Retirement removes daily colleagues. Friends move to Florida. Energy for maintaining relationships wanes. The infrastructure of automatic social contact crumbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with robust social connections showed 50% &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;increased survival odds&lt;/a&gt;. This isn't just about emergency contacts. Loneliness triggers inflammation, suppresses immune function, accelerates cognitive decline. Your body literally breaks down faster when socially disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 60, you face a choice: coast on existing relationships or actively build new ones. This means uncomfortable things like joining groups where you know nobody, learning technology to maintain distant friendships, becoming the one who initiates rather than waits. Research on "social convoys" shows you need 3-5 deep relationships to thrive. These don't spontaneously generate at 80—they're cultivated now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cruel timeline: when you most need connections (80+), they're hardest to form. Mobility issues, hearing loss, shrinking peer pool—everything conspires against new relationships. Your social wealth at 80 depends on what you bank at 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Challenge your brain with genuinely difficult new learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossword puzzles don't count. Neither does Sudoku number 10,000. The cognitive challenge that builds &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-0588-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cognitive reserve&lt;/a&gt;—your brain's ability to withstand age-related damage—requires genuine struggle. Think less "brain training" and more "brain boot camp."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4154531/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Denise Park at UT Dallas proved this definitively&lt;/a&gt;. Older adults learned quilting or digital photography—genuinely complex new skills requiring sustained effort over 14 weeks. Their memory improved significantly. The control group doing familiar activities? No change. The photography group showed the strongest gains, likely because they had to master technical information rapidly. The magic isn't in the activity; it's in the struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 60, your brain retains remarkable plasticity. You can still form new neural pathways, still master complex skills. The &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1504327" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Framingham Heart Study&lt;/a&gt; has tracked cognitive function for decades: those who embraced cognitive challenges maintained superior function decades later, independent of education or baseline intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice is stark: embrace cognitive discomfort or retreat to the familiar. Learn Python programming, study Mandarin, master the cello—something that makes you feel stupid regularly. The people sharp at 80 aren't the smartest; they're the ones who never stopped feeling dumb. They chose, at 60, to be beginners repeatedly, forcing their brains to build new highways rather than deepen existing ruts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The compounding effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three choices create what researchers call an "upward spiral of healthy aging." Strength training provides energy and confidence for social activities. Social connections offer accountability for both physical and cognitive challenges. Mental stimulation keeps you interesting enough that people want to connect. Each reinforces the others, compounding into either vitality or decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tragedy is how many 60-year-olds think they have time. They'll start weights "after the holidays." They'll make friends "in retirement." They'll learn guitar "when things settle." But the research is brutally clear: the window for setting your trajectory is now. Not next year. Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news? If you're reading this at 60, you're at the perfect pivot point. At 70, change is harder but possible. At 80, you're mostly managing what you built—or didn't build—earlier. But at 60, you can still fundamentally alter your path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question isn't whether you'll age—that contract is non-negotiable. The question is whether you'll be someone who ages with power, connection, and mental sharpness, or someone who ages into weakness, isolation, and fog. The research says the choice is yours. The doctors say these three decisions determine your outcome. The only thing left is to decide: which 80-year-old do you want to be?&lt;/p&gt;

Yet daily personal care routines can expose people to invisible risks within their own homes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hair sprays, serums, and heat styling tools release &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scented-products-release-indoor-air-pollutants/"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; so tiny they can slip deep into the lungs. New research reveals just how significant these exposures may be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-billions-of-tiny-particles"&gt;Billions of tiny particles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.purdue.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Purdue University&lt;/a&gt; team led by Nusrat Jung and Ph.D. student Jianghui Liu found that a 10-20 minute hair styling routine can produce more than 10 billion &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plastic-dust-is-making-indoor-air-more-polluted-than-outside/"&gt;airborne nanoparticles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These particles are smaller than 100 nanometers and can penetrate deeply into the lungs, triggering respiratory stress, inflammation, and even cognitive effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is really quite concerning,” Jung said. “The number of nanoparticles inhaled from using typical, store-bought hair-care products was far greater than we ever anticipated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heat-drives-the-release"&gt;Heat drives the release&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows that heating tools like straighteners or curlers are the primary drivers of nanoparticle release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At temperatures above 300 degrees Fahrenheit, volatile and low-volatility chemicals rapidly evaporate, nucleate, and condense into dense clouds of particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 360 degrees and higher, sub-100 nanometer particles made up more than 95 percent of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cutting-super-pollutants-could-quickly-cool-the-planet/"&gt;emissions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Atmospheric nanoparticle formation was especially responsive to these heat applications,” Liu explained. “Heat is the main driver – cyclic siloxanes and other low-volatility ingredients volatilize, nucleate and grow into new nanoparticles, most of them smaller than 100 nanometers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harmful-hair-styling-chemicals"&gt;Harmful hair styling chemicals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the chemicals, D5 siloxane stands out. This ingredient is widespread in hair products because of its smooth texture and thermal stability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet it is very persistent in the environment and bioaccumulates in living organisms. Animal studies link D5 siloxane to respiratory, liver, and nervous system damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we first studied the emissions from hair care products during heat surges, we focused on the volatile chemicals that were released, and what we found was already quite concerning,” Jung said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But when we took an even closer look with aerosol instrumentation typically used to measure tailpipe exhaust, we discovered that these chemicals were generating bursts of anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 nanoparticles per cubic centimeter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-than-one-pathway"&gt;More than one pathway&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Purdue study revealed that two mechanisms fuel nanoparticle creation. The first is volatilization of siloxanes and similar ingredients during heating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second involves atmospheric chemistry: fragrance additives and terpenes can react with indoor ozone, producing secondary organic aerosols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when no heat was applied, some nanoparticle formation still occurred through these chemical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-breathing-zone-risks"&gt;Breathing zone risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hair styling often happens close to the face, placing &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/millions-of-people-die-from-air-pollution-each-year-yet-theres-still-a-lack-of-monitoring/"&gt;emissions&lt;/a&gt; directly in the breathing zone. Modeling shows that nanoparticles deposit most efficiently in the pulmonary region, the deepest part of the lungs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary deposition rates for sub-100 nanometer particles are especially high, raising concern over repeated exposures from daily routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that temperature mattered more than product type. At 410 °F, more than 46 billion nanoparticles deposited in the respiratory system, compared to less than one billion at 300 °F. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long hair also led to higher doses, since longer styling times produced more emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, appliances behaved differently. Straighteners and curlers emitted the most ultrafine particles, while wavers generated fewer but larger particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, larger particles can carry greater mass, meaning risk cannot be judged by particle counts alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-safer-hair-styling-practices"&gt;Safer hair styling practices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For context, 20 minutes of hair straightening at high heat can equal the nanoparticle dose of 20-200 minutes of sitting in vehicle traffic or 30-100 minutes of exposure to urban outdoor air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In poorly ventilated homes, these exposures can become even higher as particles linger longer in indoor air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung and Liu recommend limiting the combined use of hair products and heat tools. If use cannot be avoided, ventilation becomes essential. Exhaust fans, open windows, or air purifiers can help reduce particle buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you must use hair care products, limit their use and ensure the space is well ventilated,” Liu said. “Even without heating appliances, better ventilation can reduce exposure to volatile chemicals, such as D5 siloxane, in these products.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-research-directions"&gt;Future research directions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies aim to measure even smaller particles down to one nanometer and identify their chemical makeup.

Some brands can have up to 160mg of caffeine, almost triple that of an instant coffee, nearly 10-times the level of taurine, an amino acid commonly found in meat, fish and eggs, as a salmon fillet and the same amount of sugar as a full fat Coke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has previously suggested people who drink at least one sugary drink a day are at higher risk of suffering male pattern hair loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study by Chinese researchers in 2023 found that younger men who consumed sweet drinks seven times a week had more than triple the chance of having hair loss than men who didn't consume them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the fresh research, scientists found that across the studies analysed sugary drinks impacted hair density, growth, thickness, shine, and hair loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one study in particular, &lt;span&gt;those drinking more than 3500ml per week—roughly 11 cans—were more likely to suffer the condition, particularly men, researchers found. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies have previously suggested this may be because high caffeine content in these drinks can increase cortisol levels, the stress hormone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Excess sugar is also linked to poor circulation and inflammation which can both weaken hair follicles and increase hair loss. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the scientists also discovered that vitamin D&lt;span&gt; lowered risk of both androgenetic alopecia—the genetic type—and alopecia areata—sudden hair loss, when the immune system attacks hair follicles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One trial reviewed also found a lack of protein was linked to hair thinning and colours lightening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Portuguese researchers found people who regularly consume sodas and fizzy drinks could dramatically raise their risk of hair loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts, however, have long been divided over whether sodas and fizzy drinks are linked to hair loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Susan Massick, an expert in dermatology at Ohio State University, told Healthline at the time: 'Diet does play a critical role in your overall health, particularly regarding risk for developing obesity, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, and hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, male-pattern hair loss is multifactorial.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While hair loss is usually associated with ageing, dermatologists have said they are increasingly seeing younger men seeking help for the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some going to the extreme, and expensive length, of getting hair transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's estimated that around a quarter of men in their 20s show signs of balding — but by the age of 50, that figure rises to 85 per cent of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, earlier this month it was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14996641/hair-loss-study-pp405.html"&gt;revealed &lt;/a&gt;a breakthrough drug could provide new hair hope for millions of men and women dealing with baldness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medication, called PP405, triggered hair to regrow on the heads of men and women who were balding on the front and to the front and top of their scalp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the phase 2a trial, participants rubbed gel containing the medication onto their scalp daily and saw hair begin to regrow by week eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 11:48:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxORXBpa2ZvS1BtUHJwSWltX2dxZmJ4ck9Ka3VlX192d2VURl9xYzJvX1hCOVg0TkxLNWlBOFBuRm81Y1dpa0dtZmlzZm00WXNybGJQT1gtY0p4eHJvY1liV0pzVDR6S1NjbWRScklwak1nQnJPWUtqOHRWZ1A4XzF2M3VFR2U3M0pNZGZjT09Td0h0RHUxSVBzOHk5N3NhX0dWVkQwVmJGM3nSAa4BQVVfeXFMTmVLaGVaWV9ZVVg2YVJnaVI5Z0hQZzZKU2RiS0dBLVI3S0ZjVWhIMEhXanFrOHdQN1pSTTBheXZ3emp3a2VOS0NUTHU2YUpXczBSX04xLWZPOUduRW15Ny1zOV9hUXhseEdoanE3Qi15M3RGOXdQdWF5YzFLdy1vOEtpRlg5cUhRZlR1ZmhRWkVmY0FDejRxR2FVMTlJdWtlaGNteU5OR3p0eUs4V1dR</guid></item><item><title>是什么让你头晕？ -《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/08/25/dizzyness-causes-remedies/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XWL3B2ZPCRC2BKBAR23L5RLBUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;

Some suggest these patterns can resemble what popular culture refers to as a “soul tie.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of neurons mirroring each other is a thoroughly studied mechanism. When we witness someone expressing emotion or taking action, our neurons reflect that behavior, enhancing empathy and connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this perspective, emotional entanglements might stem more from biology than mysticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This article has been reviewed for accuracy and context by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://independent.academia.edu/DrSarahMeehanOCallaghan" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Sarah Meehan O’Callaghan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an interdisciplinary researcher whose work explores culture, gender, and psychology.

Why does witnessing another person’s pain stir a physical ache in us? The mirror neuron system (MNS) may explain this reflexive emotional response, according to a 2009 study published in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2865077/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of neurons mirroring each other is a thoroughly studied mechanism, first documented in monkeys and later explored in humans. These specialized brain cells activate when we act and observe someone else doing the same, as reported in an earlier study published in &lt;a id="journal-title" class="anchor js-title-link anchor-primary anchor-has-background-color anchor-has-inherit-color staff-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3840169/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span class="anchor-text-container"&gt;&lt;span class="anchor-text"&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking experiment demonstrated that emotional pain can become so contagious that it physically registers in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, romantic partners were monitored via brain scans. When one was shown a symbol indicating the other was experiencing pain, the observer’s pain matrix activated without direct physical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This system enables empathy but can misfire. Judith Orloff, M.D., assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA and author of The Empath’s Survival Guide, warns that unregulated empathy can lead to emotional burnout (via &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/emotional-freedom/202206/how-the-brains-mirror-neurons-affect-empathy" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In relationships where emotional co-regulation becomes constant and unbalanced, often labeled “soul ties,” boundaries tend to dissolve, leading to enmeshment and a loss of self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recurring Dreams You Can’t Shake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="68abfd189315c__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?image_id=68abfd189315c__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="8 Unsettling Signs “Soul Ties” Still Grip You" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?media_id=68abfd189315c__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abfd189315c__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abfd189315c__880.jpg" alt="Person lying in dim light looking thoughtful and troubled, illustrating unsettling signs of soul ties impact." title="Person lying in dim light looking thoughtful and troubled, illustrating unsettling signs of soul ties impact." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/young-man-suffering-from-insomnia-at-night-6943440/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;cottonbro studio / Pexels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While dreams about falling or teeth cracking are common, repeatedly dreaming about one specific person may indicate a lingering emotional bond or what some might call a “soul tie.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2014 study published in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4704085/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports&lt;/a&gt; found that recurring dream imagery is shaped by the brain’s memory consolidation process during sleep. As memories are reactivated and integrated, they often surface as vivid, meaningful dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we have recurring dreams of an ex-partner, we should take note that dreams are the royal road to the unconscious and wonder what it is about that person that might relate to our childhood or primary caregiver attachments,” said Dr. Sarah Meehan O’Callaghan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, psychologist Dr. Veronika Matutyte explained that recurring dreams often reflect unresolved emotional attachments to individuals who are significant in our lives (per &lt;a href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/what-does-it-mean-when-you-dream-about-someone" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Glamour&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dreams featuring ex-partners delve into your romantic and emotional world,” Matutyte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They can signify longing, unresolved emotions, or reflections on the current state of your romantic life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand recurring dreams, Matutyte recommends keeping a journal to track repeating themes and emotions. She also suggests reflecting on your daily experiences to decode the symbolic meaning behind the dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Physical Sensations at Their Mention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="68abfd829eec9__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?image_id=68abfd829eec9__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="8 Unsettling Signs “Soul Ties” Still Grip You" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?media_id=68abfd829eec9__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abfd829eec9__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abfd829eec9__880.jpg" alt="Young man lying awake in bed at night, showing signs soul ties still grip with a troubled expression." title="Young man lying awake in bed at night, showing signs soul ties still grip with a troubled expression." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/an-insomniac-man-lying-down-8416435/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;SHVETS production / Pexels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_middle_0" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sudden jolt in your stomach or spike in heart rate when someone mentions a certain person might not just be nerves. The somatic-marker hypothesis suggests that these emotional responses are the body’s way of guiding decision-making during uncertain or emotionally charged moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This occurs when physical signals, linked to past emotional experiences, are processed in higher brain regions, as explained in a 2006 study from the &lt;a href="https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/personal/tim.dalgleish/dunnsmhreview.pdf" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic desensitization therapy, developed in the 1950s by South African psychologist Joseph Wolpe, offers one method for easing these visceral reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tested initially on anxious cats at Wits University, the approach gradually exposes individuals to triggering stimuli while teaching them relaxation techniques, according to a 2011 study published in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3215612/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Canadian Family Physician&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, it’s widely used for conditions like PTSD, social anxiety, and agoraphobia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cognitive Dissonance When You Reflect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="68abfde39ebd2__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?image_id=68abfde39ebd2__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="8 Unsettling Signs “Soul Ties” Still Grip You" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?media_id=68abfde39ebd2__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abfde39ebd2__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abfde39ebd2__880.jpg" alt="Man sitting on bed looking pensive and worried with woman lying in bed behind him, suggesting soul ties emotional struggle." title="Man sitting on bed looking pensive and worried with woman lying in bed behind him, suggesting soul ties emotional struggle." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/bickering-couple-on-bed-11790891/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Rhema / Pexels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reliving emotional pain after a breakup can signal more than just nostalgia it may reflect unresolved psychological tension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Seneca once observed, “We suffer more in imagination than in reality,” a sentiment that captures the impact of nagging rumination, a form of perseverative cognition in which the mind fixates on distressing thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a 2012 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3312901/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Innovations in Clinical Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; study, this repetitive mental loop often deepens emotional discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such ruminative thinking is frequently linked to intrusive thoughts and fractured self-perceptions resulting from relational trauma, as noted in an analysis reported by &lt;a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1029282" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;ERIC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same study found that intrusive beliefs like thinking one is unlovable explained 28% of the variance in breakup distress.

But when those memories stop you from forming healthy bonds with new people, they may act as barriers instead (per &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-at-any-age/202307/what-you-can-learn-about-yourself-from-your-past-lovers" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_middle_1" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation lies in oxytocin, the so-called “love hormone,” which is released into the bloodstream by the pituitary gland. While oxytocin strengthens attachment, residual traces after a breakup can skew attraction baselines and delay the ability to form secure new bonds, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/oxytocin-the-love-hormone" class=" staff-link"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt; states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same hormone influences a wide range of social behaviors, from nurturing to anxiety (via &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/understanding-hypnosis/202402/how-oxytocin-affects-our-relationships" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To move forward, therapists often recommend drawing on what attachment theory calls “positive schemas,” mental frameworks that support healthier connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Susan Krauss Whitbourne, Ph.D., Professor Emerita of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, wrote: “A certain kind of nostalgia for your ex, the type that allows you to feel you’ve grown and matured, is what can carry over into your current relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If negative feelings of loss and regret continue to dominate, findings from the University of Kansas suggest redirecting that emotional energy into constructive activities that encourage personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Compulsive Digital Tracking Habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="68abfe77c8622__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?image_id=68abfe77c8622__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="8 Unsettling Signs “Soul Ties” Still Grip You" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?media_id=68abfe77c8622__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abfe77c8622__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abfe77c8622__880.jpg" alt="Young woman holding a glass and looking away, showing signs of emotional tension and soul ties in a casual setting." title="Young woman holding a glass and looking away, showing signs of emotional tension and soul ties in a casual setting." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-woman-at-the-bar-5055750/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Ketut Subiyanto / Pexels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself repeatedly checking a former partner’s social media, you may be caught in a dopamine-driven feedback loop. This cycle reinforces itself through the brain’s reward system, creating a pattern that’s hard to break (per &lt;a href="https://outlook.monmouth.edu/2021/03/dopamine-driven-feedback-loops-what-are-they/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Monmouth University&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the brief dopamine rush can feel rewarding, studies show that compulsive tracking is strongly associated with breakup distress and persistent longing for ex-partners (via &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mindful-dating/202208/5-reasons-you-can-t-stop-checking-your-ex-s-social-media" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study even found that when participants looked at pictures of their exes, the same brain regions linked to physical pain lit up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical psychologist Roxy Zarrabi suggests several strategies for breaking the cycle: delay the urge by five minutes, replace it with a planned activity, focus on why the relationship ended, journal or talk through suppressed feelings, and set firm digital boundaries by temporarily deactivating accounts or blocking your ex (per &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mindful-dating/202210/6-tips-stop-checking-ex-s-social-media" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shared Unhealthy Behaviors You Never Had&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="68abff248c664__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?image_id=68abff248c664__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="8 Unsettling Signs “Soul Ties” Still Grip You" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?media_id=68abff248c664__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abff248c664__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abff248c664__880.jpg" alt="Young woman looking upset with a distant man in the background, illustrating signs soul ties still grip you." title="Young woman looking upset with a distant man in the background, illustrating signs soul ties still grip you." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/african-american-couple-arguing-at-home-5699715/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Alex Green / Pexels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_0" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picking up the very behaviors you once criticized in a partner may be explained by observational learning theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduced in the 1960s and 70s by psychologist Albert Bandura, the theory describes how people adopt new behaviors by watching others, remembering what they’ve seen, and later imitating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process has been studied through mechanisms like rule-governed behavior, imitation, and reinforcement, including a 2011 study published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3139552/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Analysis of Verbal Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3139552/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identity fusion can also drive this adoption of unhealthy habits. When individuals feel a profound sense of “oneness” with a partner or group, they may internalize behaviors, good or bad, as part of their shared identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A paper from the &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721414551363" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Association for Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt; highlights how strongly fused people are more likely to take on these actions under emotional or social pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a spillover effect where negative habits transfer through observational learning and identity fusion, eroding individuality and reinforcing unhealthy dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overwhelming Guilt When You Set Limits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="68abffaa2b5f3__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?image_id=68abffaa2b5f3__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="8 Unsettling Signs “Soul Ties” Still Grip You" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?media_id=68abffaa2b5f3__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abffaa2b5f3__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abffaa2b5f3__880.jpg" alt="Man on phone looking stressed while woman watches him, illustrating unsettling signs of soul ties affecting relationships." title="Man on phone looking stressed while woman watches him, illustrating unsettling signs of soul ties affecting relationships." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-and-woman-sitting-at-table-6963875/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Mikhail Nilov / Pexels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ilene S. Cohen, Ph.D., psychotherapist and faculty member in Barry University’s Department of Counseling, notes that while guilt can be intended as a moral compass, it often damages relationships and prevents people from honoring their own needs (per &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-emotional-meter/201705/when-guilt-keeps-you-setting-boundaries" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She explains that people-pleasers frequently assume responsibility for others’ emotions because they crave being needed. This dynamic pressures them into saying “yes” when they genuinely want to say “no.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Cohen adds, guilt convinces people they can ignore their needs and take on others’ burdens, but over time, this leads to exhaustion and imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapists often analyze this cycle through the lens of codependent dynamics, where one partner becomes “the giver” and sacrifices their well-being for a “taker” who relies on that pattern (via &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/codependency" class=" staff-link"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="postPoll-9226408" class="post-poll poll-wrapper single-post" data-poll-viewed="false" data-post-id="9226408" data-main-post-id="" data-poll-id="15808"&gt; &lt;input class="post-9226408-poll-value" type="hidden" value="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"&gt; &lt;div data-bind="if: isInitialised()"&gt;    &lt;div data-bind="if: !isLoading() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isShowingResults"&gt; &lt;div class="poll-content"&gt; &lt;h3 class="answered-content-title"&gt;Thanks!

In fact, a link between regular consumption of ibuprofen – a type of drug known as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) – and hearing loss was first identified in a major US study, the Nurses' Health Study, back in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research, which is actually a series of ongoing projects investigating how lifestyle factors influence women's health, revealed that taking ibuprofen more than twice weekly was linked to a 10 per cent higher risk of some degree of sensorineural deafness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a type of hearing loss caused by damage to the hearing mechanism in the inner ear, affecting the delicate hair cells in the cochlea, the spiral-shaped structure in the inner ear that is crucial for hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infection, trauma and chronic exposure to loud noise can all damage the hair cells. With ibuprofen, the mechanism isn't clear, but one theory is that the drug impairs blood flow to the cochlea – the inner ear needs a steady blood supply to function correctly and chemicals called prostaglandins are key to maintaining the correct blood flow. And NSAIDs block prostaglandins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once hair cells are damaged, that's it – they can't be repaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ibuprofen is now classified as having ototoxic (ear-damaging) effects. Other NSAIDs – indomethacin, naproxen, piroxicam and celecoxib, commonly used to treat pain caused by osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and sports injuries – are also associated with irreversible hearing damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ibuprofen is a type of drug known as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID). Taking it more than twice weekly was linked to a 10 per cent higher risk of some degree of sensorineural deafness in a major study in 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, aspirin, another type of NSAID, did not have this effect, in women at least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This indicates that whatever condition you need regular pain relief for, you should not continuously use an NSAID long term. It's better to try to adhere to short courses, maybe a week or two maximum, not months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;I am an 82-year-old fairly fit man with no health problems other than suffering from discitis for the past six months. I've been having infusions of antibiotics for about seven weeks. This has now stopped and the lower back pain continues. Will I see an end to this debilitating and depressing condition?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;Frank Allen, Lyme Regis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Martin Scurr replies: &lt;/span&gt;Discitis is a rare but serious condition, where the disc between two bones in the spine becomes chronically inflamed – typically in the lower spine as a result of infection caused by bacteria that's spread via the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The discs have little in the way of blood vessels in them, which limits the immune response, so bacteria can thrive. This leads to intense inflammation: potentially the infection can spread into the bone of the vertebrae either side, and form an abscess, affecting the nerves running in the spinal canal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Discitis is typically caused by staphylococci bacteria, found naturally on the skin. Discitis is more common in those with weakened immune systems, including older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of my patients suffered this condition some years ago, caused by salmonella, which we had to assume gained access to his body from food. Like yourself, the patient was a man in his eighties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The treatment involves a long course of high-dose antibiotics which must be given intravenously to ensure high levels in the blood. Usually this would continue for 12 weeks. Strict rest is important. In rare cases, surgery may be required to drain the abscess between the vertebrae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The persisting pain is not uncommon but your spinal specialist team can always refer you to pain control specialists. Your symptoms should settle entirely in the following months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;IN MY VIEW: Insurers shouldn't give health advice &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people are having to raid their savings, their pension funds and even family coffers to purchase treatment in the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seduced by the smart marketing, they often don't realise until too late that insurers impose strict rules governing any claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What also deeply worries me is that general practice is not covered. Instead, these insurers see themselves as guiding their customers through the so-called 'healthcare journey'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But patients need to be wary: the only professionals who are trained and entitled to guide patients through the 'healthcare journey' are GPs. Insurance firms have only one motive, the drive to increase profits, which means ensuring their customers receive the cheapest option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This isn't necessarily the best or the most appropriate. Not least, the insurer does not know the patient and their history, let alone their psychology, so how can they choose the best treatment options?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So regard the advice given by an insurer with great caution, including the recommended specialist. If in doubt, your GP is the best guide – both in terms of specialist and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;Write to Dr Scurr at Good Health, Daily Mail, 9 Derry Street, London, W8 5HY or email drmartin@dailymail.co.uk - include your contact details. Replies should be taken in a general context and always consult your own GP with any health worries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;KIGALI, Rwanda — In a landmark first for the continent hardest hit by HIV, a new clinical trial in South Africa has delivered a rare but extraordinary outcome: One young woman may be cured of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The story begins in May 2016 when Anele got a call from nurses at a local clinical research center in Umlazi township, which lies in South Africa's southeastern province of KwaZulu-Natal. They told her she needed to come in for an urgent appointment, before breaking the news in person that she had tested positive for HIV. She felt like her world had ended.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I cried a lot," recalled Anele, now 32, speaking to a group of assembled scientists, doctors and health officials on the first day at the International AIDS Society (IAS) conference in Kigali, Rwanda in mid-July. "I was only 23. That day, I was not OK at all." Anele explained at the IAS conference that she did not want to be fully identified due to the ongoing stigma associated with being HIV positive in Umlazi.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It may not have felt like it at the time, but compared with the &lt;a href="https://www.spotlightnsp.co.za/2025/03/31/8-million-people-living-with-hiv-in-sa-according-to-latest-estimates/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;estimated 5.2 million&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; other women living with HIV in South Africa, Anele was fortunate. Her early diagnosis and treatment plan were only possible because of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7593829/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a new social empowerment and medical &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;program called &lt;a href="https://ragoninstitute.org/fresh/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;FRESH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Females Rising through Education, Support and Health) which had begun in Umlazi back in 2012.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Six years after Anele's diagnosis, this program would see her enrolled in the first-ever clinical trial to attempt to cure HIV patients in Africa.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A trial born in Umlazi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhiv/article/PIIS2352-3018(25)00193-6/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;July 2025 article&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the medical journal &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, 10 people&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;worldwide&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;are considered cured of HIV after receiving stem cell transplants to treat aggressive blood cancer, which happened to destroy the virus. But that method is not considered safe or scalable. In recent years other "cure trials" have explored newer approaches including &lt;a href="https://www.eatg.org/hiv-news/first-in-human-trial-of-crispr-gene-therapy-for-hiv/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;gene editing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/news/headlines/clinical-trial-begins-using-car-t-cells-to-potentially-cure-hiv/2023/04" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CAR T-cell therapy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to enhance immune response, but they have yet to yield successful results.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But almost all of these trials have taken place in the U.S. Yet 67% of the 40.8 million people living with HIV are in Africa where genetic and demographic profiles are remarkably different, said &lt;a href="https://hivmedicine.ukzn.ac.za/discipline-staff/professor-thumbi-ndungu/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thumbi Ndung'u&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, who led the lab work for the trial.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In the West, the epidemic is predominantly in white, homosexual men, while in Africa, the majority of people living with HIV tend to be younger and female," Ndung'u told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This matters for several reasons. Biological responses to HIV differ between men and women, influenced by sex hormones. Yet, said &lt;a href="https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/914051/Krista-Dong" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Krista Dong&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and FRESH's clinical director, women are vastly underrepresented in cure trials. "Women make up 53% of global HIV infections, but they're grossly underrepresented," Dong noted.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-84718" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The biology of the virus also varies by region. While the dominant HIV strain in North America and Europe is clade B, sub-Saharan Africa sees mostly clades A, C, and D. Clade C, the world's most common subtype, has distinct features in how it interacts with the immune system, which potentially affects the success of curative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"To develop a cure intervention that has an impact, we have to make sure it is something that works in Africa," Ndung'u said. "And the only way we can ensure that's the case is by actually doing the trials in these populations."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A strategy of kick and kill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;FRESH has taken a different approach from earlier HIV programs. In KwaZulu-Natal, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7593829/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;researchers have long noted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that young women are particularly vulnerable to infection due to socioeconomic factors, including financial dependence on male partners and limited access to education or employment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iasociety.org/sites/default/files/Events/2022-HIV-Cure/18-The-FRESH-Cohort_Krista-Dong.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Launched&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 in Umlazi, where more than 60% of young women contract HIV before age 23, FRESH offered twice-weekly HIV testing along with an empowerment curriculum that included lessons on self-esteem and gender-based violence as well as career mentoring. Initially funded by private philanthropy and later the Gates Foundation, the program helped participants resume schooling or gain employment, while allowing researchers to detect HIV infections within days. (The Gates Foundation is a sponsor of NPR and this blog.)&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Having such frequent testing meant that the FRESH team could identify new HIV infections within a matter of days, enabling women to immediately start antiretroviral medication to suppress the virus, limiting the size and diversity of the viral reservoir. In theory, they would be easier to cure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2022, the clinical trial began. Twenty women enrolled, including Anele. All of them had been on antiretroviral therapy for an average of seven years. Sponsored by California-based drugmaker &lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gilead Sciences&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the trial used a new strategy: It aimed to flush HIV out of hiding, then neutralize it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The approach used a unique drug called vesatolimod to kick HIV out of its hiding places in the body, followed by a one-time infusion of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) on day seven. These antibodies, tailored to target clade C, would bind to the virus and summon immune cells to eliminate it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"HIV doesn't live in our blood, it lives in reservoirs whether in the lymph nodes or the liver or the brain, so you need to kick it out, so that the bNAbs can reach it," Dong said. "So what we were going for was this strategy of kick and kill."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over 20 weeks, participants received vesatolimod biweekly. Then, on day 35, they were asked to stop their antiretrovirals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They had access to counselors and a community advisory board from the University of KwaZulu-Natal and FRESH staff, assuring that they would be monitored extremely closely. But when they were first diagnosed, nurses had emphasized that they would need to take antiretrovirals for the rest of their lives. Stopping this treatment came as a shock.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The antiretroviral pause also carried real risks. When HIV rebounds, it can cause inflammation and raise the risk of transmission, but as Ndung'u explained, stopping this treatment is currently the only way to assess whether a patient is truly in remission. "We had to make sure that the participants fully understood the risks," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Within a year, 16 participants saw their virus rebound and resumed treatment — but four remained in remission, with undetectable viral loads.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potentially cured&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the coming years, understanding what set the four women who stayed in remission apart could yield vital clues about who might benefit most from this treatment approach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While Ndung'u and Dong don't yet have firm answers, they have hypotheses. Ndung'u suspects genetic factors may have helped the four women mount a more effective immune response. Dong is investigating why the therapy failed in the other 16 – whether their viral reservoirs were larger or their immune systems reacted negatively to one of the drugs. Unraveling these differences could be key to improving future strategies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The pair are eager to continue. Ndung'u hopes to launch a trial involving women infected at an unknown time — representing a more typical HIV population and possibly giving the antibodies more viral material to act on.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's also growing interest in how future cure trials might include participants with co-infections common in sub-Saharan Africa, such as tuberculosis or hepatitis B. "That's a unique but important challenge," &lt;a href="https://noguchi.ug.edu.gh/fellows/dr-helena-lamptey%EF%BF%BC/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Helena Lamptey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an immunology researcher at the University of Ghana, told NPR. "Many people with HIV have co-infections which are impacting the immune system and possibly helping HIV to persist." Cure strategies will need to reflect that reality.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For now, FRESH stands as a milestone. Of the four women who remained in remission at the trials' end, one later experienced a viral rebound. Two others chose to resume antiretrovirals – one for convenience after starting a new job that made weekly monitoring difficult, and the other to ensure a safe pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That leaves Anele. More than two years after stopping medication, she remains HIV-free and off treatment. While she remains cautious about declaring herself cured, Dong believes that it is a very real possibility.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Her case is fueling interest across the region. Researchers in countries such as Botswana have expressed the desire to run their own trials. With other new treatment possibilities emerging such as therapeutic vaccines and more advanced, long-lasting antibody infusions which Dong calls "super bNAbs," there is genuine optimism that a corner has finally been turned for people with HIV in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Even though the FRESH trial was not a home run, achieving long-term viral control in 20% of the participants is exciting," Dong said. "It has brought hope to the community that progress is being made."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Cox is a freelance health journalist who has written for publications around the world including NPR, &lt;/em&gt;The New York Times, Wired&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;The Guardian.&lt;em&gt; He has a Ph.D. in neuroscience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="CRN: Three-quarters of Americans Take Dietary Supplements" href="https://www.crnusa.org/newsroom/three-quarters-americans-take-dietary-supplements-most-users-agree-they-are-essential" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;Council for Responsible Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; (CRN), 75 percent of Americans take dietary &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/jeremy-london-supplements-for-heart-health/" target="_blank"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt;, almost all of whom believe these pills are essential for their health. In theory, this makes sense. What harm can putting added nutrients into your body do? But most people are surprised to learn that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t regulate supplements like they do medications, but rather as a subcategory of food.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;“What it means is that the [supplement] manufacturer can introduce anything into the market that they believe is safe,” &lt;strong&gt;Pieter Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;, MD, an internist at Cambridge Health Alliance and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, explained to the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.ama-assn.org/public-health/prevention-wellness/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-vitamins-and-supplements" target="_blank"&gt;American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt; (AMA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-mob-square-fixed first_ad karma_unit inline hide-desktop"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The FDA’s job is to identify the products that are causing harm after they’ve been on the market and remove them from store shelves,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there’s very little oversight of what’s in your supplements and what safe dosages are. As for the latter, doctors caution that one extremely common supplement can have serious cardiovascular risks if taken in excess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/supplements-that-cause-digestive-problems/" target="_blank"&gt;Doctor Says These 10 Supplements Can Damage Your Digestive System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Calcium supplements can raise your risk of heart damage.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/calcium-benefits/" target="_blank"&gt;Calcium&lt;/a&gt; is a mineral most commonly associated with healthy bones. In addition, “Your heart, muscles, and nerves also need calcium to function properly,” &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="Mayo Clinic: Calcium and calcium supplements" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/calcium-supplements/art-20047097" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But according to the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="NIH: Calcium" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Calcium-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH), up to 40 percent of U.S. adults consume less than the recommended amount of calcium, which increases the risk of low bone mass, fractures, and osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult men should get 1,156 mg of calcium daily, while women should aim for 1,009 mg. But since so many people don’t meet these goals through their diets, they turn to calcium supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you overdo it on these supplements, your heart could be in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2016 study published in the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="Journal of the American Heart Association: Calcium Intake From Diet and Supplements and the Risk of Coronary Artery Calcification and its Progression Among Older Adults" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/jaha.116.003815" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers from Johns Hopkins Medicine and the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill analyzed 10 years of medical tests covering more than 2,700 patients to examine the causes of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They concluded that taking calcium in the form of supplements “may raise the risk of plaque buildup in arteries and heart damage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a person ages, calcium-based plaque builds up in the body’s main blood vessel, the aorta and other arteries, impeding blood flow and increasing the risk of heart attack,” the researchers explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When it comes to using vitamin and mineral supplements, particularly calcium supplements being taken for bone health, many Americans think that more is always better,” study co-author &lt;strong&gt;Erin Michos&lt;/strong&gt;, MD, current director of Women’s Cardiovascular Health at Johns Hopkins, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://sph.unc.edu/sph-news/citing-potential-heart-damage-experts-recommend-caution-before-taking-calcium-supplements/" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “But our study adds to the body of evidence that excess calcium in the form of supplements may harm the heart and vascular system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other doctors agree that heightened levels of calcium in the blood—a condition known as &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/hypercalcemia-symptoms/" target="_blank"&gt;hypercalcemia&lt;/a&gt;—can be problematic for your heart health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hypercalcemia can seriously affect heart function and the cardiovascular system and can cause arrhythmias (an increase in irregular heartbeats) and EKG abnormalities due to the increased calcium levels disrupting the heart’s electrical activity,” &lt;strong&gt;Brynna Connor&lt;/strong&gt;, MD, healthcare ambassador at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://northwestpharmacy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;NorthWestPharmacy.com&lt;/a&gt;, previously explained to &lt;em&gt;Best Life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is because calcium is a positively charged ion that, when in the blood in normal quantities, helps carry electrical activity to the heart (along with the muscles and brain),” she continued. “However, when too much calcium is in the blood, it can alter the electrical activity of the heart, causing a change in heart rate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;But you shouldn’t limit your dietary calcium intake.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, doctors agree that hypercalcemia is rarely caused by diet. In fact, the 2016 study found that “a diet high in calcium-rich foods appears to be protective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is likely because the body metabolizes dietary calcium and calcium supplements differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It could be that supplements contain calcium salts, or it could be from taking a large dose all at once that the body is unable to process,” study author &lt;strong&gt;John Anderson&lt;/strong&gt;, PhD, professor emeritus of nutrition at UNC’s Gillings School of Global Public Health, explained in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if you’d like to up your calcium intake through what you eat, the following foods are very high in calcium:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plain, low-fat yogurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fortified orange juice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part-skim mozzarella&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sardines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nonfat milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fortified soy milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tofu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canned salmon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cottage cheese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fortified breakfast cereals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spinach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to understand that for your body to adequately absorb calcium, it also needs &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/what-happens-to-your-body-vitamin-d/" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re concerned your calcium levels are low, or you’re considering taking a calcium supplement, first speak with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;analyzed data from nearly 16,000 adults aged 19 and older using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHAMES III).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined how much animal and plant protein people typically consume and whether those patterns were associated with their risk of dying from heart disease, cancer or any cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found no increased risk of death associated with higher intake of animal protein. In fact, the data showed a modest but significant reduction in cancer-related mortality among those who ate more animal protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot of confusion around protein - how much to eat, what kind and what it means for long-term health. This study adds clarity, which is important for anyone trying to make informed, evidence-based decisions about what they eat," explains Stuart Phillips, Professor and Chair of the Department of Kinesiology at McMaster University, who supervised the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure reliable results, the team employed advanced statistical methods, including the National Cancer Institute (NCI) method and multivariate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) modelling, to estimate long-term dietary intake and minimize measurement error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was imperative that our analysis used the most rigorous, gold standard methods to assess usual intake and mortality risk. These methods allowed us to account for fluctuations in daily protein intake and provide a more accurate picture of long-term eating habits," says Phillips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found no associations between total protein, animal protein or plant protein and risk of death from any cause, cardiovascular disease, or cancer. When both plant and animal protein were included in the analysis, the results remained consistent, suggesting that plant protein has a minimal impact on cancer mortality, while animal protein may offer a small protective effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observational studies like this one cannot prove cause and effect; however, they are valuable for identifying patterns and associations in large populations. Combined with decades of clinical trial evidence, the findings support the inclusion of animal proteins as part of a healthy dietary pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When both observational data like this and clinical research are considered, it's clear both animal and plant protein foods promote health and longevity," says lead researcher Yanni Papanikolaou, MPH, president, Nutritional Strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was funded by the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA), a contractor to the Beef Checkoff. NCBA was not involved in the study design, data collection and analysis or publication of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Older adults who stay socially engaged may live longer, a new study reveals.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Geriatrics Society&lt;/em&gt; suggests that staying socially connected may play an important role in helping older adults live longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from 2,268 people in the United States who were 60 years of age or older. Participants completed the Psychosocial and Lifestyle Questionnaires and provided blood samples in 2016. When researchers followed up four years later, they found a clear connection between higher levels of social involvement and lower mortality risk. Older adults who were highly engaged in social activities were 42% less likely to die within that period compared to those with low engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain types of interaction appeared especially beneficial. Volunteering, spending time with grandchildren, and joining sports teams or social clubs were strong indicators of improved survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Biological and Physical Factors&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, analyses indicated that decelerated biological aging and greater physical activity levels played key roles in facilitating the beneficial relationship between social engagement and lower mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Staying socially active is more than a lifestyle choice. It is closely linked to healthier aging and longevity,” said corresponding author Ashraf Abugroun, MBBS, MPH, of the University of California, San Francisco. “These results underscore how participating in community life contributes to better health in older adults.”&lt;/p&gt;

Research has shown bananas are helpful for cardiovascular and digestive health, per the &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/bananas/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;An average size banana contains about 450 milligrams of potassium. For reference, it's not the fruit with the highest potassium count (1 cup of jackfruit contains nearly double that amount), but it does offer about 13% to 20% of a person's daily recommended potassium intake. Adults should be getting between 2,300 and 3,400 mg per day depending on age, sex and pregnancy status, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health (NIH);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bananas also include 3 grams of fiber (adults should aim for 21 to 38 grams of fiber per day depending on factors like sex and age). That's "important for gut health," Nadeau notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Bananas are also a quick and easy source of carbohydrates, making them a perfect pre-workout snack for an energy boost," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to lower your cholesterol? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/10/09/are-lentils-good-for-you/75312053007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Adding lentils to your diet could help.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Adding lentils to your diet could help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What are the cons of eating bananas?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For the general population, health experts say there aren't a ton of downsides to eating bananas. But for people with certain health conditions, it may be best to limit your banana intake, or even steer clear of them in general; that's a question best answered by your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Per the Cleveland Clinic, those with elevated potassium levels or diabetes may run the risk of increasing their potassium or blood sugar levels too high by eating a banana. If you have diabetes, choosing a smaller portion of banana or one that's underripe (aka still green) could help with this. And people who are sensitive or allergic to latex may also be allergic to foods that contain a certain protein, including bananas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/25/how-much-potassium-do-bananas-have/85653187007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How much potassium do bananas have?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;How much potassium do bananas have?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life UK</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 09:02:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5lOWFhVE5XT29lVkZoMWxnejU5RGt2N2lZUmVoY0RtQTRLRG5rSXEtTE9VaUQySEk4MFFVUGVkbnYwdms0MUdINGRPRkRWOV90RGlWTXdjVUNlOERsOXVKb28yVzBlWi11MGVKeEhnZExaUF83bkdISS1LanpxZw</guid></item><item><title>随着学生重返校园，疫苗怀疑危机蔓延-今日美国</title><link>https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/25/kids-back-to-school-vaccine-rates-exemptions/85629130007/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Before becoming a school nurse in Austin, Texas, Becca Harkleroad assumed mandated &lt;a href="/story/news/health/2025/08/14/hhs-rfk-task-force-childhood-vaccines-safety/85662933007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/08/14/hhs-rfk-task-force-childhood-vaccines-safety/85662933007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;childhood vaccinations&lt;/a&gt; were just part of &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/25/back-to-school-guide-2025-vaccines-meals-dei/85757375007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;back-to-school&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It never occurred to me until I was a school nurse that immunizations could be such a controversial topic,” said Harkleroad, executive director of the Texas School Nurses Organization (TSNO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/08/donald-trump-maga-estranged-family-podcast/85560726007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/08/donald-trump-maga-estranged-family-podcast/85560726007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;The controversy has only gotten more divisive in recent years&lt;/a&gt;, she said, leading more parents to exempt their kids from receiving mandated vaccinations before heading back to school due to religious or philosophical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In the 2024-2025 school year, 17 states had more than 5% of kindergarteners claiming a nonmedical vaccine exemption. Depending on the state, not every school building has a nurse on site. But if they do, the extra workload to handle those exemptions typically falls on them, Harkleroad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“What we try to do is prepare our nurses as much as possible to have those hard conversations… To hear what parents say and respond in a nonjudgmental way,” she said. “A kid is a parent’s most absolute precious treasure. Of course, they’re going to question everything they do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As nonmedical exemptions rise across the country, vaccine rates among kindergarteners are steadily decreasing. In the 2019-2020 school year, only three states reported that less than 90% of kindergarteners were vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella. Last year, that figure rose to 16 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In these states, health experts say lawmakers have made it easier for parents to opt out of vaccinating their children, which has fueled exemption rates. The decline in vaccination rates is also partly due to vaccine misinformation on social media and mixed messages about vaccine recommendations from federal health officials, said Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On Aug. 19, &lt;a href="/story/news/health/2025/08/19/covid-vaccine-recommendation-children-american-academy-pediatrics/85729535007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/08/19/covid-vaccine-recommendation-children-american-academy-pediatrics/85729535007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;the American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; broke with federal guidance and released its own vaccine recommendations. The schedule recommends that all children between six months and 23 months receive the latest COVID-19 vaccine, despite Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="/news/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; announcing in May that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was no longer recommending the shot for healthy children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="/story/news/health/2025/08/20/rfk-jr-responds-aap-covid-vaccine-guidelines/85740271007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/08/20/rfk-jr-responds-aap-covid-vaccine-guidelines/85740271007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;In response to the AAP guidance&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy called the professional organization of board-certified pediatricians “angry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“What’s disturbing are these mixed messages... that are not consistent with the science and are coming from the highest levels of Health and Human Services,” Huang said. It leads parents to question vaccines, leading to decreased vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He fears this trend may fuel disease outbreaks among children as they head back to school, just as &lt;a href="/story/news/health/2025/08/18/texas-measles-outbreak-over/85711167007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/08/18/texas-measles-outbreak-over/85711167007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;a measles outbreak centered in West Texas ended Aug. 18&lt;/a&gt;. The outbreak led to 762 cases, with two-thirds occurring in children, and two deaths of school-aged children since late January. More than 94% of cases were in unvaccinated people, according to data from the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In Texas, about 4.3% of kindergarteners opted out of receiving vaccines for nonmedical reasons during the 2024-2025 school year. If the trend continues this year, the state may fall short of the 95% vaccination rate needed to achieve herd immunity and prevent outbreaks, said Dr. Sapna Singh, chief medical officer at Texas Children’s Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It’s extremely concerning and it’s a discussion I’ve been having more and more with families,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A new state law that was passed during the measles outbreak will also make it easier for Texas parents to access vaccine exemption forms. Instead of requesting the forms to be mailed to parents, they can download the forms online starting Sept. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The mail-in process was “designed that way for parents to make a thoughtful decision,” said Terri Burke, executive director of the Immunization Partnership based in Houston, Texas. “The very basic consequence is that we’re going to see a tremendous increase in kindergarteners attending school unvaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Proponents of the law argued it modernizes and streamlines a burdensome and outdated process for busy parents juggling other tasks ahead the start of the school year, &lt;a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/publiccomments/billhistory/HB01586H.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/publiccomments/billhistory/HB01586H.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to a compilation of public comments submitted to Texas lawmakers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But Harkleroad worries parents may download the exemption because it’s more convenient than getting their child vaccinated, especially in rural areas where healthcare can be difficult to access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Exemption forms are already available online in some states, like Pennsylvania, which reported a 6% vaccine exemption rate during the 2024-2025 school year. Holly Verderame, president of the Pennsylvania Association of School Nurses and Practitioners and a school nurse in Chester County, said parents can also write a letter to the school opting out of mandated vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"School nurses, in general, are always concerned about an outbreak of any kind.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers in China studied university students’ diets and stool samples to examine how microplastics from takeout containers and bottled drinks affect gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students who ate takeout meals more frequently had significantly higher levels of microplastics, along with gut bacteria changes linked to inflammation and poor health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the study was small, researchers say it highlights the urgent need for policies limiting plastic packaging and further research into long-term health effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your takeout food might come with an extra ingredient: tiny pieces of microplastic. And, according to a new study, they're disrupting your gut health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In August, researchers from Shanxi Medical University in China published their findings in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749125013582#sec4" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Environmental Pollution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, offering an in-depth picture of how microplastics in commonly used plastic packaging are affecting human gut health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To assess these impacts, the researchers focused on a primary source of takeout orders: college students, who the team noted "frequently consume takeout food, contributing to over 50% of total takeout orders." They also observed that university students are a particularly at-risk group, as "people who order takeout food 4–7 times weekly may ingest 12–203 pieces of [microplastics] through containers. Additionally, environmental sampling of indoor environments detected [microplastics] in university dormitories and classrooms. University students face compounded [microplastic] exposure risks through oral ingestion and inhalation." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The team screened more than 200 students for inclusion in the study and selected 24 based on strict health criteria. They then asked all participants to keep a food and lifestyle diary for a week, recording how often they ate from plastic containers, drank bottled beverages, and tracked other habits that might lead to plastic ingestion. Each participant also provided stool samples, which were collected in glass jars using metal spoons to prevent cross-contamination from other plastics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers then analyzed those samples using both Raman spectroscopy and micro-FTIR, which can detect incredibly small plastic particles. The team also used DNA sequencing to examine the gut bacteria of the student participants. They found that every participant had microplastics in their stool.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On average, the researchers found between 171 and 269 plastic particles in every 100 grams of feces. Most of the microplastics were PET, the same plastic used in soda and water bottles, and most appeared as small, thin fibers. The team also detected nanoplastics, but in much smaller quantities. (The researchers noted that the technology to detect nanoplastic particles is still developing, and some of these particles are so tiny they may have been ingested rather than excreted with the feces.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The research team also observed a clear outcome: students who reported eating plastic-packaged food three or more times daily had higher levels of microplastics than those who ate less. However, they wanted to go beyond just detecting the plastics and understand what they mean for our health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So they also looked at the participants' gut bacteria and discovered that students with the highest plastic exposure had increased levels of certain bacteria associated with inflammation and illness, as well as decreased levels of beneficial bacteria that support gut health. This finding, the team added, underscores microplastics' "potential to compromise gut barrier integrity and promote systemic inflammation." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the study had a small participant pool and cannot yet prove a direct link between the plastics and gut bacteria, it is a major step in connecting the dots.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Despite analytical limitations in nanoplastic detection, this study pioneers the identification of microbial biomarkers for plastic exposure and emphasizes the urgent need for regulatory policies targeting plastic packaging," the team concluded, adding that "future studies with larger cohorts are warranted to understand "long-term health impacts." &lt;br&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;measles surged in Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; early this year, the Trump administration's actions sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists that kept them from performing the agency's most critical function — emergency response — when it mattered most, an investigation from KFF Health News shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak soon became the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-us-cases-record-high-since-1992/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;worst the United States has endured&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in over three decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25502931-acting-hhs-secretary-communications-memo-1-21-25/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;interfered with&lt;/a&gt; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-trump-mmwr-bird-flu-studies-blocked-meddling/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;stalled&lt;/a&gt; the agency's &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-data-analyses-missing-mmwr-bird-flu-seasonal-influenza/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/01/cdc-dei-scientific-data/681531/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;censored&lt;/a&gt; its data, and abruptly &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hhs-layoffs-federal-agencies-track-disease-regulate-food-health-insurance/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CDC hasn't reached out to us locally," Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. "My staff feels like we are out here all alone," &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/170_4ea49e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;she added&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak," one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. "All this training and then we weren't allowed to do anything." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, like many in West Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;researchers estimate&lt;/a&gt;. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak that unfolded in West Texas illustrates the danger the country faces as vaccination &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;rates drop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-mmr-vaccine-myths/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;misinformation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;fueled doubt&lt;/a&gt; in vaccines and exaggerated &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-on-vitamin-a-unsupported-therapies-for-measles/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the ability of vitamins&lt;/a&gt; to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Texas outbreak&lt;/a&gt; spread to &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Outbreak-Data" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/public-health-officials-release-information-on-potential-measles-exposures" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/situacion-epidemiologica-de-enfermedades-prevenibles-por-vacunacion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Mexico's Chihuahua state&lt;/a&gt; — at minimum. Together these &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;linked outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is absolutely outrageous," said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. "When you're battling contagious diseases, time is everything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"The CDC is 'stressed' currently"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-gaines-county-public-health-measles-vaccine/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;late January&lt;/a&gt; had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren't getting tested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this may be very large," she wrote in a &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Feb. 3 email&lt;/a&gt; to the Texas Department of State Health Services.

What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/164.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;One email&lt;/a&gt; asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC's recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?" Wells wrote on Feb. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It never hurts to ask the CDC," said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the &lt;a href="https://immunizeusa.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Immunization Partnership&lt;/a&gt;, a Texas nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The CDC had gone dark," said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. "We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn't expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the Trump administration's &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25502931-acting-hhs-secretary-communications-memo-1-21-25/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;freeze on federal communications&lt;/a&gt; had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed," one CDC scientist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the situation was not unique to measles. "Like most public health organizations, we weren't able to get ahold of our program people in February," he said. Information trickled out through the CDC's communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. "The CDC was gagged," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through private conversations, Benjamin said he learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/14/nx-s1-5297913/cdc-layoffs-hhs-trump-doge" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;lay off&lt;/a&gt; CDC staffers in droves. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's not that the CDC was delinquent," Benjamin said. "It's that they had their hands tied behind their backs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn't need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. "We would always offer a conversation and ask if there's anything we could do," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state's correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records "confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That's &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Email-State-Vaccines-To-Holbrooks_Redacted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;corroborated in emails&lt;/a&gt; from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC," Zach Holbrooks, the health district's executive director, told KFF Health News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren't already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn't spread measles to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in &lt;a href="https://anabaptistworld.org/texas-measles-outbreak-draws-attention-to-traditionalist-mennonite-community/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;close-knit Mennonite communities&lt;/a&gt; where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn't want to be tested, didn't want to name their contacts, and didn't want to talk with the health department. "It doesn't matter what resources I have if people won't avail themselves of it," Holbrooks said. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against COVID-19 restrictions deepened that mistrust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some &lt;a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/the-illegal-immigrants-who-love-trump" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;live in the U.S. illegally&lt;/a&gt;, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. &lt;a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/the-illegal-immigrants-who-love-trump" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Locals guess&lt;/a&gt; the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;far larger&lt;/a&gt; than the &lt;a href="https://demographics.texas.gov/Resources/TDC/Conference/b5dd2dd3-e840-45db-9e1d-8b450bd37c74/20230524_2020CensusUndercountEngagingTexas.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;U.S. Census&lt;/a&gt; count. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don't know how many people are in the community," Holbrooks said. "There's a lot of people in the shadows out here." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts say the situation in Gaines County sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 450 people — including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses, and volunteers — helped control a measles outbreak sparked in an Eastern European immigrant community in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9004490/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Clark County&lt;/a&gt;, Washington, in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Melnick, Clark County's public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. "We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc7" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",7]'&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, hundreds of people in the city's health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City's assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8103967/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;data from prior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33712549/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;. Then there's the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay6485" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the lasting toll&lt;/a&gt; of some measles infections, including &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;deafness or worse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think there's a price tag to put on a child's death that would otherwise be prevented," Zucker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/401.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;emailed a colleague&lt;/a&gt;: "I'm so overwhelmed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A death ignites a response &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 26, Texas announced that &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-death-texas-outbreak/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;a 6-year-old child had died&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;brief notice&lt;/a&gt; on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/278_46af73.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;In emails&lt;/a&gt;, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC's notice might exacerbate &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/science-speaks-blog/2025/talking-to-patients-about-measles-vitamin-a-and-the-importance-of-vaccination/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a problem&lt;/a&gt;: Doctors were &lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/public-health/2025-03-27/west-texas-children-treated-for-vitamin-a-toxicity-as-medical-disinformation-spreads-alongside-measles-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;treating children&lt;/a&gt; with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. A local Lubbock news outlet &lt;a href="https://www.everythinglubbock.com/video/%e2%80%98its-been-flying-off-the-shelf%e2%80%99-lubbock-pharmacy-sees-more-vitamin-a-and-cod-liver-oil-purchases-amidst-west-texas-measles-outbreak/10533712/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reported on a large drugstore&lt;/a&gt; where vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which contains high levels of vitamin A, were "flying off the shelf."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10788247/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;dire abnormalities&lt;/a&gt; during fetal development. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups — including &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;one founded&lt;/a&gt; by Kennedy — that diminished the need for vaccination by &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/science-speaks-blog/2025/talking-to-patients-about-measles-vitamin-a-and-the-importance-of-vaccination/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;inaccurately claiming&lt;/a&gt; that vitamin A staved off the disease's worst outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?" Milton asked &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/278_46af73.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;in an email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the CDC privately fretted, too. "HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials," one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency's notices and alerts. "If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. We haven't seen those babies born yet." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another CDC official said they've had to "walk a fine line" between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. "We're providing vitamin A," Kennedy said in an interview on &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;. "There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness," he claimed, "against serious disease and death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://methods.cochrane.org/equity/vitamin-measles#:~:text=for%20disadvantaged%20communities-,Vitamin%20A%20reduces%20the%20risk%20of%20death%20from%20measles%20by,measles%2Drelated%20deaths%20and%20complications" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;studies Kennedy referenced&lt;/a&gt; were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12271920/pdf/main.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;seldom useful&lt;/a&gt; against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. He followed this with numerous &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;inaccurate statements&lt;/a&gt;. "There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year," he said. "It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera." There is &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that measles vaccines "cause deaths every year." Scores of studies show that the vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub5/full" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;doesn't cause&lt;/a&gt; encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.&lt;/p&gt;

The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-vaccines-do-not-contain-fetal-cells-thimerosal/?srsltid=AfmBOooFb-cjKAkF4bdqTZQGSfABTYTou4a103IbBEydq3cDgzmGs1xo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;does not contain&lt;/a&gt; an iota of fetal cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Staff are exhausted"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite national attention after the country's first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Local hospitals are at capacity," &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/257_bdb6df.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;wrote Jeffrey Hill&lt;/a&gt;, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. "The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now," &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/260.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;he added&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding," Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/104.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt;, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. "Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It &lt;a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/measles-takes-root-mexico" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;spread to Mexico&lt;/a&gt; when an unvaccinated Mennonite child visited relatives in Seminole and returned home with an infection. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen &lt;a href="https://liberties.aljazeera.com/en/mexico-grapples-with-its-worst-measles-outbreak-in-decades/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;in decades&lt;/a&gt;, with at least 3,700 cases and &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/situacion-epidemiologica-de-enfermedades-prevenibles-por-vacunacion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;13 deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the state of Chihuahua.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then another child in West Texas &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/texas-measles-outbreak-second-child-death-unvaccinated/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;died of measles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine &lt;a href="https://tinalexander.github.io/notes/2025/04" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;advisory meeting&lt;/a&gt; in late April. "There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas," Sugarman said. "We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. "A lot of people presumed their kids had measles," he said, "and didn't see the need to confirm it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 18, health officials declared the West Texas &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-texas-over-health-officials/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;outbreak over&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;not to vaccinate&lt;/a&gt; their kids, alarmed by unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers lacking expertise in vaccines and infectious disease, including some who have expressed anti-vaccine views. One of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, &lt;a href="https://x.com/RWMaloneMD/status/1908665463279677915" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;blamed the deaths of children&lt;/a&gt; with measles on "medical mismanagement," &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;without evidence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/health/trump-state-health-grants-cuts.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;$11 billion&lt;/a&gt; in public health funds earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As measles surged in Texas early this year, the Trump administration’s actions sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists that kept them from performing the agency’s most critical function — emergency response — when it mattered most, an investigation from KFF Health News shows.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The outbreak soon became the worst the United States has endured in over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25502931-acting-hhs-secretary-communications-memo-1-21-25/"&gt;interfered with&lt;/a&gt; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-trump-mmwr-bird-flu-studies-blocked-meddling/"&gt;stalled&lt;/a&gt; the agency’s &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-data-analyses-missing-mmwr-bird-flu-seasonal-influenza/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/01/cdc-dei-scientific-data/681531/"&gt;censored&lt;/a&gt; its data, and abruptly &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/politics/probationary-federal-employees-agencies-firings-doge"&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt; staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CDC hasn’t reached out to us locally,” Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. “My staff feels like we are out here all alone,” &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/170_4ea49e.pdf"&gt;she added&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak,” one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. “All this training and then we weren’t allowed to do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, like many in West Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html"&gt;researchers estimate&lt;/a&gt;. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outbreak that unfolded in West Texas illustrates the danger the country faces under the Trump administration as vaccination &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm"&gt;rates drop&lt;/a&gt;, misinformation flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/"&gt;fueled doubt&lt;/a&gt; in vaccines and exaggerated &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-on-vitamin-a-unsupported-therapies-for-measles/"&gt;the ability of vitamins&lt;/a&gt; to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;Texas outbreak&lt;/a&gt; spread to &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Outbreak-Data"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/public-health-officials-release-information-on-potential-measles-exposures"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/situacion-epidemiologica-de-enfermedades-prevenibles-por-vacunacion"&gt;Mexico’s Chihuahua state&lt;/a&gt; — at minimum. Together these &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm"&gt;linked outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;“This is absolutely outrageous,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. “When you’re battling contagious diseases, time is everything.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘The CDC Is “Stressed” Currently’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-gaines-county-public-health-measles-vaccine/"&gt;late January&lt;/a&gt; had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren’t getting tested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think this may be very large,” she wrote in a &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf"&gt;Feb. 3 email&lt;/a&gt; to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf"&gt;another email&lt;/a&gt; what she’d learned from conversations around town: “According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In that email &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/251.pdf"&gt;and others&lt;/a&gt;, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/164.pdf"&gt;One email&lt;/a&gt; asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC’s recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?” Wells wrote on Feb. 5.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It never hurts to ask the CDC,” said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I asked him to escalate this question to someone more qualified,” &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/163.pdf"&gt;Milton wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “Of course, we know the CDC is ‘stressed’ currently.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Tear-sheet-163.png" alt="A clipping of a redacted email that reads, &amp;quot;I just called the CDC and spoke to the information specialist.

He wanted to reach scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who could answer urgent questions about measles from front-line workers in West Texas. Emails have been redacted to protect the privacy of individuals and facilities.&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;(Screenshot by KFF Health News)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the &lt;a href="https://immunizeusa.org/"&gt;Immunization Partnership&lt;/a&gt;, a Texas nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The CDC had gone dark,” said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. “We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn’t expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technically, the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25502931-acting-hhs-secretary-communications-memo-1-21-25/"&gt;freeze on federal communications&lt;/a&gt; had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed,” one CDC scientist said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the situation was not unique to measles. “Like most public health organizations, we weren’t able to get ahold of our program people in February,” he said. Information trickled out through the CDC’s communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. “The CDC was gagged,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through private conversations, Benjamin learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/14/nx-s1-5297913/cdc-layoffs-hhs-trump-doge"&gt;lay off&lt;/a&gt; CDC staffers in droves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not that the CDC was delinquent,” Benjamin said. “It’s that they had their hands tied behind their backs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn’t need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. “We would always offer a conversation and ask if there’s anything we could do,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state’s correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records “confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That’s &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Email-State-Vaccines-To-Holbrooks_Redacted.pdf"&gt;corroborated in emails&lt;/a&gt; from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC,” Zach Holbrooks, the health district’s executive director, told KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren’t already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn’t spread measles to others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in &lt;a href="https://anabaptistworld.org/texas-measles-outbreak-draws-attention-to-traditionalist-mennonite-community/"&gt;close-knit Mennonite communities&lt;/a&gt; where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn’t want to be tested, didn’t want to name their contacts, and didn’t want to talk with the health department. “It doesn’t matter what resources I have if people won’t avail themselves of it,” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against covid restrictions deepened that mistrust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some &lt;a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/the-illegal-immigrants-who-love-trump"&gt;live in the U.S. illegally&lt;/a&gt;, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. &lt;a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/the-illegal-immigrants-who-love-trump"&gt;Locals guess&lt;/a&gt; the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf"&gt;far larger&lt;/a&gt; than the &lt;a href="https://demographics.texas.gov/Resources/TDC/Conference/b5dd2dd3-e840-45db-9e1d-8b450bd37c74/20230524_2020CensusUndercountEngagingTexas.pdf"&gt;U.S. Census&lt;/a&gt; count.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don’t know how many people are in the community,” Holbrooks said. “There’s a lot of people in the shadows out here.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health experts say the situation in Gaines sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Tear-sheet-124.png" alt="A clipping of a redacted email that reads, &amp;quot;Below is some info I learned from speaking with the Mennonite women and also from talking to providers and staff today. Hopefully this gives you some perspective. Younger people in the Mennonite community are not vaccinated—those over 25 are more likely to be vaccinated. Young parents are not vaccinating their children. Older community members understand that Measles is dangerous.

According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November. The community fdeels burned by COVID-19 restrictions; we need to be mindful of this. We need to respect the culture; don't go in telling people what to do. By-in from men is important. We should focus on education — signs/symptoms, how it's spread.

KFF Health News obtained emails through Freedom of Information Act requests to local health departments. The emails have been redacted to protect the privacy of individuals and facilities.&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;(Screenshot by KFF Health News)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 450 people — including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses, and volunteers — helped control a measles outbreak sparked in an Eastern European immigrant community in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9004490/"&gt;Clark County&lt;/a&gt;, Washington, in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alan Melnick, Clark County’s public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. “We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, hundreds of people in the city’s health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City’s assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8103967/"&gt;data from prior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33712549/"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;. Then there’s the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay6485"&gt;the lasting toll&lt;/a&gt; of some measles infections, including &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html"&gt;deafness or worse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think there’s a price tag to put on a child’s death that would otherwise be prevented,” Zucker said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/401.pdf"&gt;emailed a colleague&lt;/a&gt;: “I’m so overwhelmed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Death Ignites a Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 26, Texas announced that &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;a 6-year-old child had died&lt;/a&gt; of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html"&gt;brief notice&lt;/a&gt; on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/278_46af73.pdf"&gt;In emails&lt;/a&gt;, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC’s notice might exacerbate &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/science-speaks-blog/2025/talking-to-patients-about-measles-vitamin-a-and-the-importance-of-vaccination/"&gt;a problem&lt;/a&gt;: Doctors were &lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/public-health/2025-03-27/west-texas-children-treated-for-vitamin-a-toxicity-as-medical-disinformation-spreads-alongside-measles-outbreak"&gt;treating children&lt;/a&gt; with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. A local Lubbock news outlet &lt;a href="https://www.everythinglubbock.com/video/%e2%80%98its-been-flying-off-the-shelf%e2%80%99-lubbock-pharmacy-sees-more-vitamin-a-and-cod-liver-oil-purchases-amidst-west-texas-measles-outbreak/10533712/"&gt;reported on a large drugstore&lt;/a&gt; where vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which contains high levels of vitamin A, were “flying off the shelf.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10788247/"&gt;dire abnormalities&lt;/a&gt; during fetal development.&lt;/p&gt;

Emails obtained by KFF Health News have been redacted to protect the privacy of individuals and facilities.&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;(Screenshot by KFF Health News)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups — including &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/robert-f-kennedy-jr/"&gt;one founded&lt;/a&gt; by Kennedy — that diminished the need for vaccination by &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/science-speaks-blog/2025/talking-to-patients-about-measles-vitamin-a-and-the-importance-of-vaccination/"&gt;inaccurately claiming&lt;/a&gt; that vitamin A staved off the disease’s worst outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?” Milton asked &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/278_46af73.pdf"&gt;in an email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the CDC privately fretted, too. “HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials,” one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency’s notices and alerts. “If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. We haven’t seen those babies born yet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another CDC official said they’ve had to “walk a fine line” between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. “We’re providing vitamin A,” Kennedy said in an interview on &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;. “There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness,” he claimed, “against serious disease and death.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://methods.cochrane.org/equity/vitamin-measles#:~:text=for%20disadvantaged%20communities-,Vitamin%20A%20reduces%20the%20risk%20of%20death%20from%20measles%20by,measles%2Drelated%20deaths%20and%20complications"&gt;studies Kennedy referenced&lt;/a&gt; were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12271920/pdf/main.pdf"&gt;seldom useful&lt;/a&gt; against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. He followed this with dangerously &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/"&gt;inaccurate statements&lt;/a&gt;. “There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year,” he said. “It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.” There is &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/"&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that measles vaccines “cause deaths every year.” Scores of studies show that the vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub5/full"&gt;doesn’t cause&lt;/a&gt; encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-jr-mmr-vaccine-fetus-b2742886.html"&gt;another interview,&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy said, “The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris.” The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-vaccines-do-not-contain-fetal-cells-thimerosal/?srsltid=AfmBOooFb-cjKAkF4bdqTZQGSfABTYTou4a103IbBEydq3cDgzmGs1xo"&gt;does not contain&lt;/a&gt; an iota of fetal cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Staff Are Exhausted’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite national attention after the country’s first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Local hospitals are at capacity,” &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/257_bdb6df.pdf"&gt;wrote Jeffrey Hill&lt;/a&gt;, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. “The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now,” &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/260.pdf"&gt;he added.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding,” Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/104.png"&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt;, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. “Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It &lt;a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/measles-takes-root-mexico"&gt;spread to Mexico&lt;/a&gt; when an unvaccinated Mennonite child returned home after visiting family in Seminole. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen &lt;a href="https://liberties.aljazeera.com/en/mexico-grapples-with-its-worst-measles-outbreak-in-decades/"&gt;in decades&lt;/a&gt;, with at least 3,700 cases and &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/situacion-epidemiologica-de-enfermedades-prevenibles-por-vacunacion"&gt;13 deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the state of Chihuahua.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then another child in West Texas &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;died of measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine &lt;a href="https://tinalexander.github.io/notes/2025/04"&gt;advisory meeting&lt;/a&gt; in late April. “There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas,” Sugarman said. “We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. “A lot of people presumed their kids had measles,” he said, “and didn’t see the need to confirm it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 18, health officials declared the West Texas &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt;outbreak over&lt;/a&gt;, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/"&gt;not to vaccinate&lt;/a&gt; their kids, worried over unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/kennedy-rfk-vaccine-panel-acip-cdc-hhs-immunizations/"&gt;on the fringes&lt;/a&gt; of the scientific establishment. For example, one of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, &lt;a href="https://x.com/RWMaloneMD/status/1908665463279677915"&gt;blamed the deaths of children&lt;/a&gt; with measles on “medical mismanagement,” &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/"&gt;without evidence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/health/trump-state-health-grants-cuts.html"&gt;$11 billion&lt;/a&gt; in public health funds earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amid Lubbock’s toughest months, Wells sent &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/253.pdf"&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt; to the department’s exhausted staff. “The future is uncertain, and I know this is an unsettling time for many of us,” she wrote. “Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large-scale study found that following a Mediterranean-style diet significantly reduces the risk of dementia, particularly in people genetically predisposed to &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;Alzheimer’s&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Alzheimer&amp;amp;#039;s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects older adults, leading to memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. It is the most common cause of dementia. The disease is characterized by the buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain, which disrupt cell function and communication. There is currently no cure, and treatments focus on managing symptoms and improving quality of life.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mediterranean Diet Linked to Dementia Risk Reduction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study led by investigators from Mass General Brigham, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Broad Institute of &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;MIT&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;MIT is an acronym for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It is a prestigious private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts that was founded in 1861. It is organized into five Schools: architecture and planning; engineering; humanities, arts, and social sciences; management; and science. MIT&amp;amp;#039;s impact includes many scientific breakthroughs and technological advances. Their stated goal is to make a better world through education, research, and innovation.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt; and Harvard suggests that a Mediterranean-style diet may help reduce dementia risk. The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, found that people at the highest genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease benefited more from following a Mediterranean-style diet, showing a greater reduction in dementia risk compared to those at lower genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One reason we wanted to study the Mediterranean diet is because it is the only dietary pattern that has been causally linked to cognitive benefits in a randomized trial,” said study first author Yuxi Liu, PhD, a research fellow in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, and a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Chan School and Broad. “We wanted to see whether this benefit might be different in people with varying genetic backgrounds, and to examine the role of blood metabolites, the small molecules that reflect how the body processes food and carries out normal functions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Genetic and Metabolic Roots of Alzheimer’s&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few decades, researchers have learned more about the genetic and metabolic basis of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. These are among the most common causes of cognitive decline in older adults. Alzheimer’s disease is known to have a strong genetic component, with heritability estimated at up to 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One gene in particular, apolipoprotein E (&lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt;), has emerged as the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer’s disease — the more common type develops later in life and is not directly inherited in a predictable pattern. People who carry one copy of the &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; variant have a 3-to-4-fold higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s. People with two copies of the &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; variant (called &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; homozygous) have a 12-fold higher risk of Alzheimer’s than those without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tracking Diet, Genes, and Metabolites Over Decades&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore how the Mediterranean diet may reduce dementia risk and influence blood metabolites linked to cognitive health, the team analyzed data from 4,215 women in the Nurses’ Health Study, following participants from 1989 to 2023 (average age 57 at baseline). To validate their findings, the researchers analyzed similar data from 1,490 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, followed from 1993 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers evaluated long-term dietary patterns using food frequency questionnaires and examined participants’ blood samples for a broad range of metabolites. Genetic data were used to assess each participant’s inherited risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Participants were then followed over time for new cases of dementia. A subset of 1,037 women underwent regular telephone-based cognitive testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dietary Protection Strongest in High-Risk Individuals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that the people following a more Mediterranean-style diet had a lower risk of developing dementia and showed slower cognitive decline. The protective effect of the diet was strongest in the high-risk group with two copies of the &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; gene variant, suggesting that diet may help offset genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that dietary strategies, specifically the Mediterranean diet, could help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and stave off dementia by broadly influencing key metabolic pathways,” Liu said. “This recommendation applies broadly, but it may be even more important for individuals at a higher genetic risk, such as those carrying two copies of the &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; genetic variant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Study Limitations and the Need for Broader Research&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study limitation was that the cohort consisted of well-educated individuals of European ancestry. More research is needed in diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, although the study reveals important associations, genetics and metabolomics are not yet part of most clinical risk prediction models for Alzheimer’s disease. People often don’t know their &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; genetics. More work is needed to translate these findings into routine medical practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Next Steps: Toward Personalized Dementia Prevention&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In future research, we hope to explore whether targeting specific metabolites through diet or other interventions could provide a more personalized approach to reducing dementia risk,” Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A hormone-receptor interaction weakens immunity. Targeting it could fight cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at UT Southwestern Medical Center have identified how a hormone binds to a receptor on immune cells, allowing cancer cells to evade the body’s defenses. The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Immunology&lt;/em&gt;, points to potential new directions in cancer immunotherapy and may also open avenues for treating inflammatory and neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Myeloid cells are among the first group of immune cells recruited to tumors, but very quickly these tumor-fighting cells turn into tumor-supporting cells. Our study suggests that receptors on these myeloid cells get stimulated by this hormone and end up suppressing the immune system,” said Cheng Cheng “Alec” Zhang, Ph.D., Professor of Physiology and a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center at UT Southwestern. Dr. Zhang co-led the study with first author Xing Yang, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in the Zhang Lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zhang noted that current immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, only benefit about 20%-30% of patients. This limited success suggests that cancer uses multiple strategies to escape detection and destruction by the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Discovery of LILRB4 receptor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, researchers in the Zhang Lab examined how myeloid cells, a type of immune cell that normally attacks cancer, could be suppressed. They identified an inhibitory receptor called LILRB4, and when this receptor was activated, the myeloid cells lost their ability to target tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on that discovery, Dr. Zhang, Dr. Yang, and their team conducted a genome-wide search for proteins that interact with LILRB4. One strong candidate was a hormone known as SCG2. While earlier studies hinted that SCG2 might influence immune activity, its precise role and receptor were not established. Laboratory tests confirmed that SCG2 binds directly to LILRB4, triggering a signaling cascade that shut down the tumor-fighting function of myeloid cells and prevented them from recruiting T cells to attack tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mice genetically altered to express the human form of LILRB4, injected cancer cells that produced SCG2 grew rapidly as tumors. Treating these mice with an antibody that blocks LILRB4 significantly slowed cancer growth, as did artificially ridding the animals’ bodies of SCG2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these experiments suggest that interactions between LILRB4 and SCG2 allow cancer to grow unchecked by myeloid cells, T cells, and potentially other immune cell types. Dr. Zhang suggested that disrupting this interaction could someday offer a new immunotherapy option to treat cancer. Conversely, because this interaction neutralizes myeloid cells’ immune activity, delivering extra SCG2 could be a promising treatment for autoimmune or inflammatory disorders spurred by myeloid cells. Dr. Zhang and his colleagues plan to investigate both ideas in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;

When they're not taking it [marijuana], their threshold of being able to handle anxiety is so low they actually require it just to function in daily life.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forty-four percent of 19- to 30-year-olds used marijuana in 2022, the latest date available, or 25.3million people, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nida.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/2023/08/marijuana-and-hallucinogen-use-binge-drinking-reached-historic-highs-among-adults-35-to-50"&gt;estimates suggest&lt;/a&gt;, up from 28 percent that used the substance in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest that users have a roughly 30 percent chance of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14183807/elton-john-america-worst-decisions-health.html"&gt;becoming addicted to weed&lt;/a&gt;, with signs of addiction including inability to reduce usage, constant cravings and relationship problems. Withdrawal can feature a lack of appetite, restless sleep, mood swings and, in more extreme cases, uncontrolled vomiting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-6106111/One-seven-Americans-used-marijuana-year.html"&gt;According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 2.7million Americans meet the criteria for marijuana use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Addiction may be attributable to the drug's potency, which has increased over time. Ryan Sultan, a psychiatrist at Integrative Psychiatry who specializes in substance use, said the strength of marijuana products had increased by design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘One of the marketing schemes is to talk about your [marijuana] being as strong as possible. When you get stronger, the risk of addiction for anything is going to go up,’ he told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;More young adults are becoming addicted to cannabis, experts suggest (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pollock added: ‘Kids grew up with the idea from parents and [others] that weed is a very bad substance; it's illegal and you can't engage in it. All of a sudden, they're seeing it's legal with weed shops on every corner.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marijuana is illegal at the federal level and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-11645727/How-America-surrendered-marijuana-KAYLA-BRANTLEY-reveals-pot-ubiquitous-US.html"&gt;fully legal in 24 states&lt;/a&gt;, plus Washington DC. More than half of Americans live in states where recreational marijuana is legal, and 79 percent live in a county with at least one dispensary, according to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/08/facts-about-marijuana/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A typical dispensary sells ‘pre-rolls’, such as joints and blunts, as well as gummies and edibles. Dozens of strains are available from $25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The content of THC, the psychoactive ingredient that makes one 'high' after consuming marijuana, in most strains is around 20 to 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a significant rise in THC content from 1995, when the average batch of marijuana seized by the DEA had a THC content of four percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sultan said: ‘An old joint would have a little bit of weed, like a skinny, little coffee straw, and now we have these massive, enormous joints.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In weed pens and vapes, THC can reach percentages in the 90s. They are normally available for $50 to $100. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pollock said: ‘Weed pens make it very convenient. They reduce the amount of smell quite a bit, so even in school or at work, it's very easy to hide it in comparison to other addictive substances such as alcohol, where it is much more apparent that someone is actively under the influence.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sultan is also concerned about the pens and vapes, as they are part of a trend of marijuana products designed for faster, easier consumption, with weed at its strongest levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows how cannabis use has risen among 19-to-30-year-olds and older adults as more states have legalized the drug&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, marijuana is illegal at the federal level, classified as Schedule 1, putting it in the same class as heroin and ecstasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;President Donald Trump said in August that he was 'looking' at reclassifying the drug: ‘Some people like it, some people hate it. Some people hate the whole concept of marijuana because if it does bad for the children, it does bad for people that are older than children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It's a very complicated subject, the subject of marijuana. I've heard great things having to do with medical and I've heard bad things having to do with just about everything else.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Joe Biden’s administration &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/us/politics/marijuana-schedule-drug-biden.html"&gt;proposed &lt;/a&gt;moving marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug last May. A Schedule 3 drug, such as ketamine or testosterone, has 'moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sultan, however, believes there should be more oversight around weed, especially its source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weed grown illegally can be contaminated with pesticides or other toxic ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It's gone from a boutique hobby to organizations that are trying to make money. There's very little regulation or enforcement of regulation around quality [of] ingredients, whether the label is accurate or looking for pesticides. It's supposed to all be tested but a lot of the testing is a little bit of a joke.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-12-19/california-weed-cleanup"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt; found that 'more than half of cannabis smoking products in California’s legal market contain chemicals for which there is no public safety monitoring.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were 2,022 cases of vape product-related lung injuries &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html"&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;in January 2020, per the CDC. About 80 percent of patients reported using weed products, which were largely acquired from 'informal sources' such as dealers, online sellers or friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking ahead, Pollock and Sultan believe there need to be drastic changes to the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sultan added: 'If science was in charge of the laws, which we never have been, we would pretty clearly say that no one should be using under the age of 25.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 08:17:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNejQ1VjhNbVVVTFJZRWtyY2Mwb3pJY2oxUEVQQTF0YU9WVUxua3g0Wmx3T0FPZFNYankzZ2VpX19wSklQbTZqUEFMOVlPTkYyTVVWYkpMWS1VaVdvLVZtZ2xwRjIwY25ZLWwweGRpSTRhTkUzeTZ4NXpTRTFBbGFhLVVnMjNBT1VxOUlqOFJNNjFHdUxHNFZQQVh2SzLSAaIBQVVfeXFMT05ycUNhR3c4aXBtbGY5THBXc2FuX0p6OWlIRUIwaTNKMkVRTzB3OF9CeHljZ1dDTGpWM0o5ZU50WXZtbHZSblU5X2lSWDdTbFlvZkxpc3lUcVN5SDR3VXQ5X19RdW1GRklBZXE2MUxnc3VoWFQwTzM4c2szRVlKdGNpbjJLQTFaakh2Qmo2R2pZSGs0YWVBMGpEMFdob1VoNVJ3</guid></item><item><title>通过简单的10秒测试可以及早预测痴呆症风险- The Mirror</title><link>https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/dementia-risk-could-predicted-early-35761554</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-body" class="ArticleBody_article__AwrJE" data-testid="body"&gt;&lt;h1 class="HeadingOne_heading-one__mmNWJ  __className_db5d47"&gt;Dementia risk could be predicted early with simple 10-second test&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 class="LeadText_lead-text__wd_PA __className_337f14" data-testid="leadtext"&gt;Testing your physical abilities could reflect how healthy your brain is.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_image-embed__0T8WX ImageEmbed_image-lead__Ti3qQ" data-testid="leadimage"&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure_figure__Uce4f"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35761441.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1755782872.jpg" alt="Man standing up" loading="eager" srcset="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35761441.ece/ALTERNATES/s508/0_GettyImages-1755782872.jpg 508w, https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35761441.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1755782872.jpg 615w,

Dementia is a syndrome characterised by a &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/distressing-dementia-warning-sign-can-35330238" target="_self" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt;group of symptoms related to the ongoing deterioration of brain functions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;It is most prevalent in individuals over the age of 65 and often results in memory issues and behavioural changes. In some instances, the &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/early-dementia-signs-can-found-35275759" target="_self" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt;symptoms of dementia may not become apparent until the condition has advanced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;However, there are methods to predict your chances of developing dementia early. Neurologist &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@doctor.bing/video/7540035872360615199?lang=en" target="_self" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt;Doctor Baibing Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, better known online as Dr Bing, shared some ways to assess your risk of dementia. In a video posted on the social media platform TikTok he listed potential ways to test for dementia, including a simple 10-second check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;"Here are five signs that someone might be at risk for dementia, he said. "Number one is the inability to stand on one leg for at least 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="BoxStyles_box-container__Qk3WH BoxStyles_non-commercial__aiWwo" data-testid="recommended-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;"If you're 70 years old or younger (and have legs) you should be able to do this and if you can't do this it's associated with increased risk of dementia because impaired balance reflects early dysfunction in the brain regions responsible for motor control such as cerebellum and basal ganglia, which are also affected in neurodegenerative processes. " His recommendations are backed by research published in the &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19276547/" target="_self" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt;Journal of Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/a&gt; in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;In a trial involving more than 680 participants, scientists discovered that people who were unable to balance on one leg for five seconds faced a greater risk of mental deterioration associated with Alzheimer's disease. The study's authors concluded: "An abnormal one-leg balance test is a marker of more advanced dementia and predicts a higher rate of cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="BoxStyles_box-container__Qk3WH BoxStyles_non-commercial__aiWwo" data-testid="non-commercial-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image-group"&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_image-embed__0T8WX false" data-testid="imageembed-35761443"&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure_figure__Uce4f"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35761443.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2143995561.jpg" alt="Man standing on one leg" loading="lazy" srcset="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35761443.ece/ALTERNATES/s458b/0_GettyImages-2143995561.jpg 458w, https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35761443.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2143995561.jpg 615w,

More precisely, the research determined that failing to maintain balance on one leg for over 20 seconds correlated with microbleeds and "silent" strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Study lead Dr Yasuharu Tabara, from Kyoto University in Japan, explained: "Our study found that the ability to balance on one leg is an important test for brain health.

Individuals showing poor balance on one leg should receive increased attention, as this may indicate an increased risk for brain disease and cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Dr Bing outlined four additional methods for assessing dementia risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="HeadingTwo_heading-two__4TTeG  __className_db5d47"&gt;Bodyweight squat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;The failure to perform a bodyweight squat may also signal mental deterioration. He explained: "This is usually tested using a chair stand test or a sit to stand test and the inability to do this is associated with dementia risk because poor lower limb strength and mobility indicate early decline in neural circuits involved in both motor and cognitive function.

Some would argue that satisfying your sweet tooth or trying a new dessert is just as important as going for a morning walk. Similar to humans, our furry friends also have a knack for sugary treats, and this video of a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever’s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Golden Retriever’s&lt;/a&gt; first time trying donuts showed exactly how much they love them. Banks’ mom documented his very first go at the snack, and it’s as sweet as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Golden Retriever is ‘gentle’ while trying donuts in video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems our pets enjoy a sweet snack just as much as we do, but it’s essential to tread carefully, because once the sugar rush kicks in, there’s no stopping. A dog owner documented her Golden Retriever’s first experience with donuts in a wholesome Instagram video. The in-video text shared more context to the post, “Letting Banks try a donut for the first time and look how gentle he is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the clip, the duo appeared to be sitting in an outdoor cafe setup when the dog mom, Lydia Morey, told the pup to take “gentle bites.” Morey then took a small portion of the sweet treat and offered it to him, advising him to take a single bite at first. Banks didn’t rush with his experience as he clearly wanted to savor the sweetness of the moment and carefully bit a tiny chunk before licking all the crumbs off his nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following clips of the video showed the Golden Retriever going in for a second bite of the donut following his owner’s command. It was clear from his nose licks and paw taps that he didn’t just like the treat, but it was love at first sight. Banks then went in for a third bite while his mom, evidently satisfied by his reaction, smiled at the camera, before finally finishing it off with a fourth bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenters praised the pup’s gentleness with his first donut ever, with one user even hoping to “have his self-control.” Morey further revealed in the caption that she believes he is likely the only Golden “who would prefer sweet over savory,” and that he has been this way since he was a puppy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/188046-golden-retriever-first-time-trying-donuts-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Golden Retriever’s First Time Trying Donuts Is as Sweet as It Gets;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Video: Golden Retriever’s First Time Trying Donuts Is as Sweet as It Gets&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 07:03:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5PN2k2TjBmeXl6XzlaVV8tVENrUmFrOGdvNkdEV1UzeGtfcExhUlJveEU1QWhDc01USXgxb1E4bHctRmMtZm1MTURYN3lHM0JubklBS3RSM0F2VzhnS2JaTFMtSjQxLVZUVkRzV3BuUk0zRXQtNDhF</guid></item><item><title>培训师说，如果您只有15分钟的空闲时间，这是您应该做的步行锻炼- Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/walking/a-trainer-says-this-is-the-walking-workout-you-should-do-if-you-only-have-15-minutes-to-spare</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p id="fd349949-440a-4047-8721-474f2a3c7e05"&gt;When you only have 15 minutes to spare, one of the best things you can do for your health is to go for a walk. Time spent outdoors is great for your mental and physical health, and if you want to challenge yourself, there’s a simple way to make it into a walking workout—just add structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denise Chakoian, a fitness trainer and the owner of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.corefitprov.com" target="_blank" data-url="http://www.corefitprov.com" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;CORE&lt;/a&gt;, rates walking workouts for the cardiovascular benefits while being gentle on your joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="fd349949-440a-4047-8721-474f2a3c7e05-2"&gt;“For many people, especially beginners or those returning after injury, walking provides a safe way to build endurance without the strain that running or high-intensity workouts can bring,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chakoian adds that some of the many cardiovascular benefits of walking include blood pressure regulation, boosting circulation and strengthening the heart muscle, all of which can contribute to higher energy levels and an improved sense of wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking also engages the large muscles of the legs and core, which improves posture and balance over time,” says Chakoian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a trainer’s standpoint, the accessibility of walking means clients are more likely to stay consistent, since it requires no special equipment and can be done almost anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you can do this walking workout on a treadmill if you need a little extra support with balance, or if that is a more accessible option, Chakoian recommends getting outside as often as you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-p4Su7x9hVwBZ5Bz6idkAbk" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-p4Su7x9hVwBZ5Bz6idkAbk slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking outdoors exposes people to fresh air and sunlight, which supports mood and vitamin D levels,” says Chakoian. “Beyond physical health, walking plays a major role in stress management and mental clarity. A steady walking routine helps lower cortisol and creates time to reset mentally, which is just as important as the physical benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-do-this-15-minute-walking-workout" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-this-15-minute-walking-workout"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do this 15-minute walking workout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check id="df796964-503e-4002-8031-c82266b6d39e"&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images / wera Rodsawang)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="a3ecafad-37e3-4179-8330-def290d51629"&gt;Chakoian’s walking workout spends five minutes on the warm-up and cool-down.

			&lt;p&gt;The secret to stronger, whiter, healthier teeth has been hidden on the top of our heads this entire time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/toothpaste-made-from-hair-provides-natural-root-to-repair-teeth"&gt;King's College London&lt;/a&gt; have devised a way to use a common protein found in hair to help regenerate tooth enamel; the substance that keeps people's pearly whites strong and pearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teeth aren't bones – a vital distinction that isn't just for pedantry, but an explanation for why they don't &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lab-grown-teeth-are-another-step-closer-to-reality-scientists-reveal"&gt;regenerate&lt;/a&gt; when lost or broken. So when tooth enamel erodes through diet, lapses in oral hygiene, or even aging, &lt;span&gt;exposing the softer, pale yellow dentin beneath, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;it's the start of permanent damage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lab-grown-teeth-are-another-step-closer-to-reality-scientists-reveal"&gt;Lab-Grown Teeth Are Another Step Closer to Reality, Scientists Reveal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dental decay can weaken a tooth's strength and stiffness (ability to resist deformation) by up to &lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202502465"&gt;95 percent&lt;/a&gt;, leading to persistent pain and loss of function. The resultant cavities form holes in the teeth and may expose the nerve endings within, leading to hypersensitivity, potential tooth loss, and eventually even jawbone deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This issue is surprisingly common: the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/infographics-do/gbd-2019"&gt;Global Burden of Disease 2019&lt;/a&gt; reports that untreated dental caries (decay) in permanent teeth affects approximately 2 billion people. This makes dental decay potentially &lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202502465"&gt;the most common disease worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and a cause of ballooning healthcare costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentally applied resins often used to fix decay can be toxic, inferior to real tooth enamel, and a burden to resource and material sustainability. And while fluoride treatments can slow enamel erosion, they cannot prevent or reverse it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter the protein &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin"&gt;keratin&lt;/a&gt;, which the researchers extracted from sheep wool (as opposed to our own hair) and placed in artificial saliva. The keratin pulled minerals from the simulated spit and assembled itself into something like tooth enamel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lo and behold, it behaved like it, too, filling in caries to provide enamel-like protection, function, and pearlescent brilliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For best effect, the researchers combined different types of keratin, and other proteins, to achieve various desired characteristics. These included a hierarchical (nesting-doll-like) structure that gave the keratin mix exceptional strength, durability, and resistance to numerous types of degradation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172013" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172013" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hair_toothpaste1_642.jpg" alt="diagram of keratin toothpaste research" class="wp-image-172013 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hair_toothpaste1_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hair_toothpaste1_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hair_toothpaste1_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172013" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;From sheep to teeth - the path of keratin toothpaste.

Products may be available in the form of a daily toothpaste, or a clinically applied gel, like nail varnish. Imagine going to the dentist to get your teeth varnished and seeing your smile transform over the following days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this research may propel the dental industry toward a more &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-we-build-a-circular-economy-to-save-the-planet"&gt;circular economy&lt;/a&gt; founded on a "&lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/toothpaste-made-from-hair-provides-natural-root-to-repair-teeth"&gt;waste-to-health innovation&lt;/a&gt;," creating an essential healthcare resource from what are otherwise garbage materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202502465"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Healthcare Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Here's something that might surprise you: the person who leaves the party early to go home and read isn't missing out. They're onto something. While society pushes the narrative that happiness requires constant connection, those who genuinely enjoy solitude have quietly developed qualities the rest of us spend thousands on therapy trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research challenges everything we assume about loners. People who actively seek and enjoy time alone aren't damaged or deficient. They've figured out that &lt;a href="https://www.thepositivepsychologypeople.com/the-misconception-about-introversion-and-extroversion-enjoying-alone-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;solitude and loneliness&lt;/a&gt; are completely different things. One is being alone and feeling empty; the other is being alone and feeling full. Those who've mastered the latter have developed remarkably enviable traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They have bulletproof self-awareness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who love solitude know themselves in ways that unsettle the rest of us. They can explain exactly why they reacted badly to that comment last Tuesday, what triggers their anxiety, which childhood experience shaped their thing about authority. This isn't narcissism—it's the result of spending actual time with their thoughts instead of drowning them out with podcasts and plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/what-self-awareness-really-is-and-how-to-cultivate-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; only 10-15% of the 95% of people who think they're self-aware, actually are. Those who regularly  spend time alone tend to fall into that rare category. They've had uncomfortable conversations with themselves that others avoid. They've sat with feelings long enough to understand them, not just react.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result? Better decisions, stable relationships, less time wasted on things that don't matter. They're not guessing what they want—they know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They're creative without trying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solitude lovers don't need brainstorming sessions or creative workshops. Their minds naturally generate ideas because they've given their brains something most of us deny them: unstructured time. When you're alone without distraction, your mind wanders into the &lt;a href="https://introvertdear.com/news/introverts-alone-time-science-marti-olsen-laney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;default mode network&lt;/a&gt;—basically, your brain's screensaver mode where the magic happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when random thoughts collide to form new ideas. It's why people get their best insights in the shower or on long walks alone. Those who regularly seek solitude are essentially giving themselves multiple shower moments every day. They're not forcing creativity; they're creating the conditions where it naturally emerges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Cain, author of "Quiet," points out that many of our greatest innovations—from the theory of evolution to the personal computer—came from people who knew how to be alone with their thoughts. The correlation isn't coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They're emotionally independent (and it shows)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch someone who loves solitude navigate a crisis. They don't immediately call six friends for advice or post vague status updates fishing for support. They sit with the problem, process it internally, then reach out if they actually need help—not because they can't handle feeling bad for five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/psychology/emotion-self-regulation#:~:text=Emotion%20self%2Dregulation%20is%20the,illness%20in%20children%20and%20adults." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;emotional self-regulation&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly rare. Most of us use other people as emotional regulators, constantly seeking validation, comfort, distraction. But those comfortable with solitude have learned to be their own emotional support system first. They still value connections, but aren't dependent on others to manage their internal weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their relationships are cleaner. They're not using friends as therapists or partners as parents. They show up whole, not as emotional vampires seeking completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They have laser focus in a distracted world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who love being alone have trained their brains to do something most of us have forgotten how to do: concentrate on one thing for extended periods without checking their phone. They can read entire books. They can work on projects for hours. They can have thoughts that last longer than a TikTok video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't because they're naturally better at focusing. It's because solitude is essentially focus training. When you're alone without distractions, you have to learn to be with whatever you're doing. There's no one to talk to, no social energy to feed off. Just you and the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our attention-deficit culture, this ability to sustain &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7851038/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;deep focus&lt;/a&gt; is becoming a superpower. While everyone else is struggling with productivity hacks and focus apps, solitude lovers have been building this muscle naturally through their quiet afternoons alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They're authentically themselves (because they've met themselves)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something different about people who spend significant time alone—they seem more solidly themselves. They're not trying on personalities or adapting interests to match whoever they're with. They know what they like, believe, value because they've had time to figure it out without outside influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7851038/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;authentic self-knowledge&lt;/a&gt; means less susceptibility to peer pressure, trends, manipulation. They've built identity from inside out, not from external feedback. While everyone wonders "who am I?" they've answered that question—multiple times, in depth, probably in journals they'll never share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, by caring less about fitting in, they become more interesting. Authenticity is magnetic, and they've got it in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They're masters of emotional intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the stereotype of the emotionally stunted loner, people who enjoy solitude often have superior emotional intelligence. They've spent so much time observing their own emotional patterns that they've become experts at recognizing them in others. They notice the slight tension in someone's voice, the forced smile, the subtle shift in energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes from &lt;a href="https://fns.sg/the-four-archetypes-of-self-awareness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;internal self-awareness&lt;/a&gt;—understanding your own emotions so well that you can recognize their echoes in others. Solitude lovers have done the homework on their own emotional landscape, which makes them surprisingly good at navigating others'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're often the friends who check in at exactly the right moment, who know when to push and when to give space, who can sit with someone else's difficult emotions because they've already sat with their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They solve problems differently (and often better)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give a problem to someone who loves solitude and watch what happens. They don't immediately crowdsource solutions or form a committee. They take the problem away, sit with it, turn it over in their mind, approach it from seventeen different angles. Then they come back with a solution that no one else thought of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because solitude allows for &lt;a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/divergent-thinking#:~:text=Divergent%20thinking%20expands%20possibilities.,make%20decisions%20based%20on%20evidence." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;divergent thinking&lt;/a&gt;—the ability to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions. When you're alone, you're not anchored by groupthink or conventional wisdom. Your mind is free to wander down weird paths and make unexpected connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While everyone else is following the same problem-solving playbook, solitude lovers are writing their own. They're not necessarily smarter—they've just given their brains the space to think differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They have unusual resilience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who enjoy being alone have a secret weapon when life gets hard: they're already comfortable with discomfort. They've sat through boring afternoons, restless evenings, anxious mornings without immediately reaching for distraction. They've learned difficult feelings pass if you let them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This builds emotional resilience that's hard to develop otherwise. When crisis hits, they don't panic about being alone with thoughts—that's their default. They know how to be their own companion through difficulty, never truly alone even by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've been doing exposure therapy for existential discomfort their whole lives. While others learn to sit with uncertainty through meditation apps, they've been doing it naturally for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. They choose quality over quantity (in everything)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who love solitude are ruthlessly selective—with their time, their relationships, their commitments. They've learned that everything has an opportunity cost measured in alone time, so they make sure it's worth it. This leads to a life that might look smaller from the outside but feels infinitely richer from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have fewer friends, but deeper friendships. Fewer hobbies, but genuine expertise. Fewer experiences, but more meaningful ones. They've figured out that depth beats breadth almost every time, and they structure their lives accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quality-over-quantity approach extends to their inner life too. They'd rather have one profound insight than twenty surface-level observations. One hour of genuine solitude beats ten hours of distracted alone time. They're not just choosing to be alone—they're choosing to be alone well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting thing about people who love solitude isn't that they've opted out of society—most haven't. They've figured out you can't give what you don't have. All those qualities we admire—creativity, authenticity, emotional intelligence, resilience—grow in the quiet spaces we usually try to fill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot twist: people who love being alone often make the best company. They show up complete, not as needy fragments seeking validation. They listen better because they're not just waiting to talk. They're more interesting because they've actually developed interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the secret isn't forcing ourselves to be more social or to love solitude. Maybe it's recognizing that people who've figured out how to be alone have developed the very qualities that make being together worthwhile. They're not antisocial—they're doing the homework the rest of us keep avoiding. Judging by the results, maybe we should take notes.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Cannabis compounds are showing early promise for healthy aging, a new study has found. However, much more research is needed to learn how results might differ depending on&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-how-long-a-cannabis-high-actually-lasts"&gt; the frequency of use&lt;/a&gt; and the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the UK reviewed 18 different studies across 15 years of research (2008 to 2023), involving both &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_mouse"&gt;animal models&lt;/a&gt; and human participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By synthesizing findings from preclinical models, clinical studies, and real-world evidence, we aimed to elucidate the potential of cannabinoids, in fostering healthy aging, mitigate age-related decline, and promote well-being in older populations," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-025-00267-x"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cannabis-linked-to-2x-risk-of-heart-disease-death-scientists-discover"&gt;Cannabis Linked to 2x Risk of Heart Disease Death, Scientists Discover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists focused on the key cannabis compounds &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol"&gt;cannabidiol&lt;/a&gt; (CBD) and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol"&gt;tetrahydrocannabinol&lt;/a&gt; (THC), finding some strong results for anti-aging effects in animal tests, and more mixed results in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the statistics are "promising" in terms of how cannabis can reduce inflammation and protect the brain, the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-025-00267-x"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt;. In animals, cannabis doses were linked to longer lifespans, improved learning, and reduced inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers caution against overhyping these positive signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171458" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171458" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CannabisTable.jpg" alt="Cannabis use" class="wp-image-171458 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CannabisTable.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CannabisTable-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CannabisTable-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171458" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cannabis use has been linked to both positive and negative health effects.

In people, we've seen it have the potential to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/largest-study-yet-on-cannabis-and-brain-function-finds-a-worrying-link"&gt;damage memory function&lt;/a&gt; in one study, while also protecting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/male-cannabis-users-seem-to-show-less-cognitive-decline-study-finds"&gt;against cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; in another. These aren't easy results to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are also keen to acknowledge that staying healthy into old age is dependent on a whole host of factors, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-30-year-study-may-have-found-the-single-best-diet-for-healthy-aging"&gt;what we eat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-how-much-sleep-you-need-for-successful-aging"&gt;how much sleep&lt;/a&gt; we get. Cannabis is only part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While these compounds show promise in addressing specific age-related challenges, maintaining a healthy lifestyle through a balanced diet, regular exercise, good sleep hygiene, and stress management remains crucial for promoting healthy aging and overall well-being," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-025-00267-x"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's cautious optimism, and the review does highlight a gap in our knowledge: we need more research into the effects of cannabis on people, involving greater numbers of participants, longer periods of time, and clearer signs of cause and effect when it comes to anti-aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that the drug is now being used more and more for medicinal purposes, and is legal in an increasing number of places in the world. However, there are still plenty of questions over &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cannabis-use-is-linked-to-epigenetic-changes-scientists-discover"&gt;just how cannabis use impacts us&lt;/a&gt; – based on age, dosage amount, and accompanying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's population is getting older, and our bodies are being asked to live for longer than ever before, on average. Scientists are keen to figure out ways to ensure that longer lifespans can be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-live-past-100-experts-recommend-these-four-habits"&gt;enjoyed in good health&lt;/a&gt;, and careful cannabis use could be something worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With aging emerging as a global challenge linked to chronic diseases, identifying interventions that support a healthy lifespan and healthspan has become imperative," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-025-00267-x"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-025-00267-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Cannabis Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The materials are then processed and refined, releasing large amounts of heat-trapping gas along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On the disposal end, less than 10% of plastic is properly recycled, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/plastic-pollution-health-crisis-disease-death/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; CBS, which means the majority of our plastic waste winds up in already overflowing landfills and in fragile habitats. Over time, plastic litter may leach chemicals into soil systems, water sources, and food supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is plastic pollution concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new report references evidence to suggest that human health can be negatively affected by plastic pollution throughout the life course, from infancy onward, and with risks higher in young children. Potential health concerns include reproductive issues, cognitive dysfunction, cardiovascular problems, stroke, and cancer — and may total over a trillion dollars annually in economic losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In terms of its environmental tolls, the production of plastics generated close to 2 billion tons of heat-trapping gases in 2019 alone, &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/plastics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the United Nations. Just a few years later, the UN would take up the mission of convening global talks to reach an international treaty addressing the plastics crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In conjunction with its new report, The Lancet's Countdown on Health and Plastics was launched as an independent monitoring effort just ahead of the latest round of UN-hosted negotiations this August. Indeed, Countdown co-authors noted the "expected finalisation of this treaty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unfortunately, by the end of this month's meeting, the talks had failed to reach an agreement, with oil-producing parties refusing to move forward with plastic production caps, preferring to lean on recycling and waste management strategies instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meanwhile, rising global temperatures and plastic pollution are "causing disease, death and disability today in tens of thousands of people," Landrigan said, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/plastic-pollution-health-crisis-disease-death/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; CBS. "and these harms will become more severe in the years ahead as the planet continues to warm and plastic production continues to increase.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about plastic pollution?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While researchers work to develop new and more flexible recycling technologies as well as plastic-sensing methods for detecting pollution, widespread &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/support-eco-friendly-initiatives-by-mainstream-brands" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-plastic initiatives;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;anti-plastic initiatives&lt;/a&gt; and community cleanup efforts can help individuals tackle the issue as a collective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Households can take steps to reduce use and pollution by making simple &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plastic-free swaps;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;plastic-free swaps&lt;/a&gt; at home.

It’s fast, detailed, and helps catch problems that other scans might miss. Over the years, technology has made CT scans even sharper and more useful, which explains why hospitals and clinics are using them more than ever. In fact, in the US, the number of CT scans being done has climbed back up after the pandemic slowdown and is now higher than before. Simply put, CT has moved from being “special” to almost essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/experts-warn-of-salmonella-dublin-cattle-born-superbug-that-is-spreading-to-humans/articleshow/123487059.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/intermittent-fasting-can-increase-the-risk-of-heart-disease-finds-study-heres-what-it-means/articleshow/123488759.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Intermittent fasting can increase the risk of heart disease, finds study: Here's what it means&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="7628252" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="JAMA-study" source="Orion"&gt;JAMA study&lt;/keyword&gt; highlights the life threatening risk associated with annual computed tomography (CT) examinations in the United States&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;has found that the widespread use of CT scans in the United States could be linked to about 103,000 new cancer cases over the lifetime of those exposed in 2023 alone. With 93 million CT scans performed that year, researchers estimate that radiation from these scans could account for roughly 5% of all new cancer diagnoses annually if current practices continue. The study highlights that while CT scans are an essential diagnostic tool saving countless lives, their radiation exposure is a known cancer risk, especially concerning children, who are more sensitive to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How did researchers estimate the 103,000 future cancers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers estimated the projected 103,000 future cancers from the 2023 CT scans by combining several key data points and methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number of CT scans: They used data showing that approximately 93 million CT scans were performed in the US in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiation dose per scan: Each type of CT scan involves a measurable radiation dose, which is known from medical physics and radiology studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk models: Researchers applied well-established cancer risk models, primarily based on data from atomic bomb survivors and other radiation-exposed populations. These models estimate the lifetime risk of developing cancer per unit of radiation exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demographic factors: The risk assessment accounted for age, sex, and the specific organs exposed during the CT scan, recognizing that younger patients have higher sensitivity to radiation-induced cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifetime risk projection: By multiplying the radiation dose from each scan by the associated cancer risk and the number of scans performed, then summing across all scan types and patient demographics, researchers estimated the total number of future cancer cases attributable to 2023 examinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjustments for uncertainty: Researchers included statistical uncertainty ranges and sensitivity analyses to reflect confidence intervals in their estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach integrates real-world CT scan usage data with recognized radiation risk science to provide a credible projection of the potential long-term cancer burden from medical CT imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common cancers projected to result from CT radiation include lung, colon, leukemia, bladder, and breast cancers. Abdominal and pelvic CT scans contribute to the largest share of these cancer cases. The risk per scan is higher in children but, since adults undergo the majority of scans, most projected cancers occur in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts emphasize that for individual patients, the risk from a necessary CT scan is low and the benefits usually outweigh the risks. However, the growing use of CT imaging, sometimes in situations without clear clinical need, raises concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How should one weigh CT scan benefits versus radiation risk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weighing the benefits of a CT scan against the radiation risk depends on your specific health situation, and it’s important to discuss this with your healthcare provider. Here’s a simple way to approach it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical necessity: If your doctor recommends a CT scan, it’s usually because the potential benefits, accurate diagnosis, guiding treatment, or detecting serious conditions, outweigh the small risk of radiation. Often, CT scans provide critical information that other tests cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors: Consider your age, overall health, and frequency of past scans. Younger people and children are more sensitive to radiation. If you’ve had multiple CT scans recently, it’s worth discussing whether this scan is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatives: Ask if there are non-radiation imaging options like MRI or ultrasound that could provide similar information. Sometimes these are suitable alternatives with no radiation exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiation dose: Inquire about the radiation dose for your particular CT scan. Advances in technology have reduced doses significantly, and radiologists strive to use the lowest dose needed for clear images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communication: Be open with your doctor about your concerns. Together, you can evaluate the urgency of the scan, potential health consequences of skipping it, and personal risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, if a CT scan is recommended by a qualified provider, the benefit of accurate diagnosis and treatment outweighs the risk. But it’s always good to have a clear, informed discussion tailored to your health needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study calls attention to balancing CT scan benefits with their potential long-term cancer risks, urging more cautious and judicious use of this powerful imaging technology in US healthcare. "If current practices persist, CT-associated cancer could eventually account for 5% of all new cancer diagnoses annually," the researchers have warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 02:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>长期新冠肺炎患者的生活与帕金森氏症和中风相当- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/life-with-long-covid-comparable-to-parkinsons-and-stroke</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;When most people think of COVID now, they picture a short illness like a cold – a few days of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="171985" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;, sore throat or cough before getting better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for many, the story doesn't end there. Long COVID – &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Post_COVID-19_condition-Clinical_case_definition-2021.1"&gt;defined by the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) as symptoms lasting at least three months after infection – has become a lasting part of the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="171985" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most research has focused on describing symptoms – such as fatigue, brain fog, and breathlessness. But we know less about their effect on daily life, and this hasn't been well studied in Australia. That's where our new study, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1071/PY25033"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt;, comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-are-trying-nicotine-gum-for-long-covid-could-it-treat-brain-fog"&gt;People Are Trying Nicotine Gum For Long Covid – Could It Treat Brain Fog?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show long COVID isn't just uncomfortable or inconvenient. People with the condition told us it can profoundly limit their daily life and stop them from doing what they want to do, and need to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is long COVID?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long COVID affects about &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/post-covid-19-condition-(long-covid)"&gt;6% of people with COVID&lt;/a&gt;, with more than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-022-00846-2"&gt;200 symptoms&lt;/a&gt; recorded. For some, it lasts a few months. For "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0042-1759568"&gt;long haulers&lt;/a&gt;" it stretches into years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of the problem is hard to measure, because symptoms vary from person to person. This has led to debate about what long COVID really is, what causes it, and even &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmqr.2022.100167"&gt;whether it's real&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But mounting evidence shows long COVID is very real and serious. Studies confirm it reduces quality of life to levels seen in illnesses such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/CPT.0000000000000291"&gt;chronic fatigue syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ptj/pzac005"&gt;stroke, rheumatoid arthritis and Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here's what people with long COVID told us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We surveyed 121 adults across Australia living with long COVID. They had caught COVID between February 2020 and June 2022, with most aged 36–50. Most were never hospitalised, and managed their illness at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But months or years later, they were still struggling with daily activities they once took for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171991" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171991" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/long_covid_life_642.jpg" alt="woman sitting on a couch with her head in her hands" class="wp-image-171991 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/long_covid_life_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/long_covid_life_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/long_covid_life_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171991" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Life with long COVID can make normal activities a challenge. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEVkCgpKHI/"&gt;Pavel Danilyuk/Pexels/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the impact, we asked them to complete two surveys widely used in health research to measure disability and quality of life – the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/international-classification-of-functioning-disability-and-health/who-disability-assessment-schedule"&gt;WHODAS 2.0&lt;/a&gt;) and the Short Form Health Survey (&lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/health-care/surveys_tools/mos/36-item-short-form.html"&gt;SF-36&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These surveys capture people's own voices and lived experience. Unlike scans or blood tests, they show what symptoms mean for everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with long COVID reported worse disability than 98% of the general Australian population. A total of 86% of those with long COVID met the threshold for serious disability compared with 9% of Australians overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, people had trouble with daily activities on about 27 days a month and were unable to function on about 18 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tasks such as eating or dressing were less affected, but more complex areas – housework and socialising – were badly impacted. People could often meet basic needs, but their ability to contribute to their homes, workplaces and communities was limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality of life was also badly affected. Energy levels and social life were the most impacted, reflecting how fatigue and brain fog affect activities, relationships and community connections. On average, overall quality of life scores were 23% lower than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the implications?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;International research shows similar patterns. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s41687-023-00572-0"&gt;One study across 13 countries&lt;/a&gt; found similar levels of disability. It also found women had higher disability scores than men. As long COVID disability has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.28.24308048"&gt;many facets and can change a lot over time&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn't fit into traditional ways of providing health care for chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key insight from our study is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5435/JAAOS-D-23-00040"&gt;the importance of self-reported outcomes&lt;/a&gt;. Long COVID has no diagnostic test, and people often report &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2025.108665"&gt;health professionals are sceptical&lt;/a&gt; about their symptoms and their impact. Yet our study showed people's own ratings of their recovery strongly predicted their disability and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shows self-reports are not just "stories". They are valid and reliable indicators of health. They also capture what medical tests cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, fatigue is not just being tired. It can mean losing concentration while driving, giving up hobbies, or pulling away from cherished friendships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171993" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171993" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/long_covid_life2_642.jpg" alt="worker looking fatigued, being comforted by another worker" class="wp-image-171993 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/long_covid_life2_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/long_covid_life2_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/long_covid_life2_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171993" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Fatigue can interfere with work, hobbies, and relationships. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGEXzuhfvw/"&gt;KORN V./Quality Stock Arts/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study shows long COVID disrupts futures, breaks connections, and creates daily struggles that ripple out to families, workplaces and communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What needs to happen next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence presented to the &lt;a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House/Former_Committees/Health_Aged_Care_and_Sport/LongandrepeatedCOVID/Report"&gt;2023 parliamentary long COVID inquiry&lt;/a&gt; estimates hundreds of thousands of Australians are living with long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know disadvantaged communities are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.51435"&gt;even more likely&lt;/a&gt; to be impacted by the cascading effects of long COVID. So ignoring the scale and severity of long COVID risks &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/first-covid-hit-disadvantaged-communities-harder-now-long-covid-delivers-them-a-further-blow-183908"&gt;deepening inequality&lt;/a&gt; and worsening its impact even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By building services based on lived experience, we can move towards restoring not just health, but dignity and participation in daily life for people with long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need rehabilitation and support services that go beyond basic medical care. People need support to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/PHM.0000000000002368"&gt;manage fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, such as "pacing" and conserving energy by not overexerting themselves. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10926-024-10173-3"&gt;Workplaces need to accommodate&lt;/a&gt; people with long COVID by reducing hours, redesigning job demands and offering flexible leave. People also need support to rebuild social connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this requires people with long COVID to be thoughtfully assessed and treated. Listening to patients and valuing their experience is a crucial first step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We'd like to acknowledge the following co-authors of the research mentioned in this article: Tanita Botha, Fisaha Tesfay, Sara Holton, Cathy Said, Martin Hensher, Mary Rose Angeles, Catherine Bennett, Bodil Rasmussen and Kelli Nicola-Richmond.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263623/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/danielle-hitch-382866"&gt;Danielle Hitch&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Lecturer in Occupational Therapy, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/deakin-university-757"&gt;Deakin University&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/genevieve-pepin-519306"&gt;Genevieve Pepin&lt;/a&gt;, Professor, School of Health and Social Development, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/deakin-university-757"&gt;Deakin University&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/kieva-richards-2461600"&gt;Kieva Richards&lt;/a&gt;, Lecturer in Occupational Therapy, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/la-trobe-university-842"&gt;La Trobe University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

							&lt;p&gt;Back in college, I had a roommate who would wrap himself in a thick comforter while our apartment hit 78 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AC was broken, windows were open, and there he was—cocooned like he was camping in the Arctic instead of sweating through a Brooklyn heatwave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Aren't you dying in there?" I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Can't sleep without it," he mumbled through the fabric fortress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought he was just being dramatic. But turns out, the need for blanket security—even when it's physically uncomfortable—reveals some fascinating things about how our brains work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After diving into the research (and interrogating every blanket-dependent person I know), I've noticed six traits that keep showing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They're highly sensitive to their environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blanket sleepers aren't just picky about temperature—they're tuned into everything. Like that friend who immediately notices when someone rearranges the furniture or can't concentrate if there's even the faintest hum from the refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This heightened sensitivity is actually a real thing. Researchers call it "&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/highly-sensitive-person"&gt;sensory processing sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;," and about 20% of people have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their nervous systems pick up on subtleties others miss: the way light hits the wall differently, slight changes in air pressure, even emotional shifts in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these folks, a blanket isn't just about warmth—it's about creating consistent sensory input. The gentle, even pressure acts like a buffer against all those tiny environmental changes that might otherwise keep their brains alert and scanning for threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it like wearing noise-canceling headphones, but for your entire body. The blanket creates a predictable sensory environment that lets their mind finally downshift into sleep mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They crave routine and predictability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know those people who eat the same breakfast every day, take the same route to work, and get genuinely thrown off when their favorite coffee shop changes its menu? Yeah, they probably sleep with blankets year-round too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something deeply satisfying about having one part of your day that stays exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When everything else feels chaotic—work deadlines, family drama, the general unpredictability of existing as a human—that familiar weight and texture becomes an anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started noticing this pattern when I was tracking my own sleep habits last year. On nights when my routine got disrupted—late dinner, different pillow, forgot to charge my phone—I slept terribly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the one constant that helped me drift off, even on weird nights? My lightweight blanket, folded just so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blanket becomes part of a sleep ritual that signals to your brain: "Okay, we're doing this thing we always do. Time to power down." It's like having a consistent opening chord in the song of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They're naturally more anxious&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's where things get interesting. Anxiety and blanket dependency often go hand in hand, and it's not just because anxious people are "needy" or "childish." There's actual &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/do-weighted-blankets-work"&gt;neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we're anxious, our nervous system is stuck in alert mode—heart rate elevated, muscles tense, mind racing through worst-case scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deep pressure from a blanket triggers something called "deep pressure stimulation," which activates our parasympathetic nervous system (the "rest and digest" mode) and helps regulate cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the same reason weighted blankets became so popular, or why some people find tight hugs incredibly calming. The pressure creates a physiological shift that anxious brains desperately need but often can't access on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One friend described it perfectly: "Without my blanket, I feel like I'm floating in space. With it, I feel grounded." That sense of being unmoored, untethered—that's anxiety talking. And the blanket provides literal and figurative weight to counter that feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They're deeply introspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might sound like a stretch, but hear me out. People who need blankets for sleep tend to be the same ones who spend a lot of time in their heads—processing the day, analyzing interactions, planning tomorrow, or just letting their minds wander through random thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introspective people often struggle with what sleep researchers call "&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-90673-1"&gt;cognitive arousal&lt;/a&gt;"—their brains don't have an easy off switch. They're the ones lying in bed remembering a conversation from three weeks ago or suddenly solving a work problem at 11 PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blanket creates a physical boundary that helps contain all that mental activity. It's like building a soft fortress around your thoughts, giving them a defined space instead of letting them scatter everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I experienced this firsthand during a particularly stressful period where I was obsessing over a career decision. No blanket meant lying there mentally drafting pros and cons lists until 2 AM. With my trusty throw, somehow that same mental energy felt more contained, more manageable. Less like thoughts spiraling outward, more like them settling inward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They value emotional security above comfort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, blanket sleepers will choose emotional comfort over physical comfort almost every time. They'll endure being hot, sweaty, or uncomfortable because the alternative—feeling exposed or unprotected—is worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not about temperature regulation; it's about emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blanket represents safety, security, a known quantity in a world full of unknowns. Taking it away feels like removing a shield, leaving them vulnerable to whatever anxieties or worries might creep in during those quiet moments before sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: sleep is when we're most defenseless. We're unconscious, unaware, completely out of control. For people who already tend toward anxiety or sensitivity, adding the feeling of physical exposure makes that vulnerability unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've watched friends choose to be uncomfortably warm rather than sleep without their blanket, even when they're complaining about the heat. It's not logical—it's emotional. And emotions don't care about logic when it comes to feeling safe enough to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is about being "weak" or "childish." Needing a blanket to sleep comfortably is just one way some brains have learned to self-regulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a pretty elegant solution, actually—using something simple and accessible to address complex neurological and emotional needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a year-round blanket sleeper, you're probably someone who feels deeply, notices subtly, and needs a little extra help creating the conditions for rest. That's not a flaw—it's just how your particular nervous system works best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you're sharing a bed with someone who insists on blankets in July, maybe cut them some slack. They're not trying to torture you with their body heat. They're just trying to feel safe enough to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the simplest solutions are the most profound ones. A blanket isn't just fabric—it's a tool for emotional regulation, sensory management, and psychological safety. Not bad for something you can pick up at Target for twenty bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;THANKS to social media platforms like TikTok, there is a lot of hype around magnesium. But is the obsession warranted?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Express spoke with general practitioner and social media content creator Dr Mariana Browne to learn more about the different types of magnesium and what they are good for. There are about five different types of magnesium salts that can help boost your magnesium levels. One of the most popular is magnesium citrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often use this to aid with constipation because it helps draw water into the gut and stimulate a bowel movement, explained Browne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium glycinate is another popular magnesium that many have been using. This can help with anxiety and aid with sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have patients who use it for their muscle cramps because it also aids with muscle relaxation. However, if you take it during the day it can make you feel tired,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium sulphate which was in the news recently is used intravenously in the hospital for severe asthma, pre-eclampsia, paediatric nephritis and to prevent seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The least popular are magnesium malate which can help people boost energy and magnesium threonate, a form of magnesium that can help with cognition and memory. The mineral is also available in the form of magnesium oil which is also very popular on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This oil can be applied directly onto the skin and usually contains magnesium chloride which can potentially aid in anxiety, sleep and relaxation, said Browne. The application of magnesium oil is also believed to ease muscle pain and cramps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not all supplements are for everybody,” said the physician. “As with any supplement, I recommend not relying solely on magnesium, instead try to make necessary lifestyle changes. If you have problems sleeping, try to address the root cause behind your insomnia, exercise and do things that will make you tired naturally, cut back on caffeine and alcohol. If you have digestion issues, instead of relying on the magnesium citrate, eat lots of fibre and drink lots of water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Browne recommends having a conversation with your physician about whether magnesium or any other supplement is right for you especially if you are on medication or have a chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Well, then there is one more reason to add kiwi to your diet. Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a California-based gastroenterologist trained at Harvard and Stanford, has explained why kiwi is a powerful addition to your diet to improve gut health. Take a look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Relieves constipation naturally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are struggling with constipation, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9572406/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;kiwi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; is your saviour. This green and tangy fruit naturally relieves constipation, thanks to its fiber content. “Kiwi has a unique type of fiber that pulls water into your stool, making bowel movements softer, easier, and more regular,” Dr. Sethi explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Why kiwi should be part of your daily routine? Benefits for digestion, skin, and immunity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;IBS-friendly&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often find that most fruits give them bloating, pain, and discomfort due to high FODMAP sugars. Kiwi, however, is naturally low FODMAP. “Meaning it's less likely to trigger bloating, gas, or pain in people with IBS,” Dr. Sethi adds. You can enjoy this fruit, reap its benefits, without upsetting your gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Excellent source of fiber&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to keep your gut healthy and going is to add adequate fiber. Dr. Sethi stresses that one kiwi has about 2-3 grams of fiber. Explaining the benefits of the special type of fiber found in kiwi, the doctor adds, “It's the kind of fiber that makes it powerful for gut motility and stool consistency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Digestive enzyme boost &lt;br&gt;  &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://biomedpharmajournal.org/vol17no2/a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis-of-kiwifruits-impact-on-functional-constipation/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Kiwi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; helps improve digestion. But how? This fruit contains actinidin, a natural enzyme that helps break down protein. This enzyme is responsible for how the gut handles heavy meals, especially those rich in meat or dairy. So if you eat kiwi with or after a protein-rich meal, it may help with digestion and reduce post-meal discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Clinically proven&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sethi stresses that the benefits of kiwi are clinically proven. Research supports kiwis’ role in improving gut health. Clinical studies have shown that eating just two green kiwis a day regularly can significantly reduce constipation symptoms within a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Better than supplements&lt;br&gt;  &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s right. This humble fruit could even beat your expensive supplements. When digestion becomes sluggish, people turn to powders and pills to boost fiber intake. However, studies suggest that kiwi performs even better. “Studies suggest kiwi works as well as, and sometimes better than, common fiber powders or pills, without the artificial additives,” Dr. Sethi says in a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNv6z6EWoRp/?hl=en&amp;amp;img_index=1" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; shared on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The benefits extend beyond gut health&lt;br&gt;  &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course, the benefits of eating kiwi are not just limited to gut health.

We're not just seeing CRPV, but we're seeing increases in Lyme disease and other mosquito-borne illnesses and tick-borne illnesses as well,' Dr Omer Awan of the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maryland/index.html" id="mol-d44c1a30-811c-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; School of Medicine told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan noted that the type of heat and moist conditions mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas thrive in has been spreading out into parts of the US that have never dealt with those conditions before. And the viruses affecting rabbits, squirrels, and deer are spread by insect bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Throughout the northern US and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/canada/index.html" id="mol-fece0f70-811c-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1" class="class"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, squirrels have been spreading squirrel fibromatosis, a virus causing wart-like growths that may ooze fluid but usually heal on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rabbits, cases of cottontail rabbit papilloma virus (CRPV), also known as Shope papilloma virus, have been spreading north throughout the Midwest, moving from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/colorado/index.html" id="mol-fece0f71-811c-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1" class="class"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; to Minnesota, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nebraska/index.html" id="mol-fece0f72-811c-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1" class="class"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/south-dakota/index.html" id="mol-fece0f73-811c-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1" class="class"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Americans from the Pacific Northwest to the Northeast have spotted cases of deer cutaneous fibroma, better known as deer warts. This condition is the same viral family as the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hpv/index.html" id="mol-13f603d0-811d-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1" class="class"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt;, causing growths all over a deer's body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A Reddit user recently posted images of a rabbit in Shope papilloma virus in Saint Paul, Minnesota in late July &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Deer warts are spread by a virus which is transmitted through mosquito and tick bites. This deer, posted on X, was photographed in Ohio &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the sightings are taking Americans by surprise, experts assured that these grotesque conditions are not new diseases, but are centuries-old viruses that only infect the species carrying them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan emphasized that humans cannot contract any of these conditions from wildlife or the insects that bite them. That's because each virus will not replicate in a tick or mosquito for it to be transmitted to people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, as the summer heat bleeds into more months of the year, the doctor warned that these disease-carrying pests are living longer and invading more states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That puts more Americans at risk for the other diseases they carry, including Lyme, West Nile, Zika, Dengue Fever, and Chikungunya, all of which are potentially fatal conditions in severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The threat will not likely be year-round but certainly will expand by weeks, if not months, in the year. We will start to see these diseases become endemic in areas not thought to harbor these diseases, which is already occurring,' Dr Awan explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is a prime environment and climate for many of these illnesses to soar. I think it's sort of a perfect storm for many of these diseases to thrive,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AccuWeather has forecasted that the fall will be hotter than normal for parts of 25 states, particularly in the eastern and northwestern US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AccuWeather's lead long-range expert Paul Pastelok said: 'There is a clear trend of hot and sticky summer weather sticking around longer into the back-to-school season across much of the East Coast and many other parts of the country.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The AccuWeather team added it's not just the fall forecast that's a problem; warmer temperatures throughout all of 2025 have affected the number of disease-carrying insects people will see the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Disease-carrying mosquitoes cannot transmit deer warts, squirrel fibromatosis, or cottontail rabbit papilloma virus, but they can infect humans with other illnesses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Residents in Canada have also captured images of infected squirrels who were covered in hairless tumors associated with fibromatosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Warmer, humid weather doesn't just bring outdoor fun - it can bring mosquitoes. These insects thrive in wet, hot climates. The location's weather patterns over the past several months can determine how many mosquitoes emerge,' meteorologists explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While climate changes in recent years have helped the virus to spread, Dr Awan noted that there's one other factor contributing to the increase in mutated animal sightings: social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People are starting to talk about it more, they're starting to document it more on social media, and hence, there's been a lot more discussion about this,' the doctor explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you look at a rabbit, you start to see these outgrowths through the head, the face, the neck. It certainly prompts your attention, and people take pictures of it, and they talk about it,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Colorado, there have been multiple sightings of rabbits with CRPV, particularly near the city of Fort Collins, over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) has urged anyone who sees infected rabbits to stay away and not touch them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reports of squirrel fibromatosis, or squirrel pox, date back to 2023, when residents in Maine captured images of common gray squirrels covered in tumors while visiting their backyards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Squirrel fibromatosis is caused by a virus that cannot be transmitted to people or other animals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A Reddit user posted an image in 2024 of a rabbit in Fort Collins, Colorado, exhibiting signs of Shope papilloma virus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In late June, a Reddit users photographed a young deer with its face completely covered in warts in Milwaukee, Wisconsin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While disease-carrying insects can transmit the virus, wildlife experts believe homeowners who put bird feeders in their yards may have also unintentionally caused the virus to spread to more squirrels who gathered there looking for food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shevenell Webb from the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife said: 'It's like when you get a large concentration of people. If someone is sick and it's something that spreads easily, others are going to catch it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for deer warts, the condition is part of the same broad family of viruses that can affect humans, known as papillomaviruses, which target the skin and mucous membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In humans, papillomaviruses cause conditions like common warts, plantar warts, and genital warts, and some strains are linked to cancers such as cervical or throat cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deer warts can be small, like a pea, or grow as big as a football, appearing gray, black, or fleshy and often hairless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is rarely fatal. The deer's immune system fights off the virus, and the warts shrink and disappear on their own after a few months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases, if the warts grow too large or become infected with bacteria, they can cause problems like blocking a deer's vision or ability to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These include forgetfulness, difficulty learning, and slower reflexes. So what contributes to an aging brain? A new study has found the culprit behind it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, has identified a protein that’s at the center of this decline. The findings of the research are published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00940-z" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aging and the &lt;keyword id="6361813" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="brain" source="Orion"&gt;brain&lt;/keyword&gt; &lt;br&gt;      &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that a certain protein slows the aging brain, and they know how to counter it. Aging is particularly harsh on the hippocampus, which is the brain region responsible for learning and memory. To understand what aging does to the brain, the researchers looked at the genes and proteins in the hippocampus that changed over time. They observed this in mice model. What they found is significant for further research on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6039826/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that there was one difference between the old and young animals. It was the presence of a protein called FTL1. The researchers observed that the old mice had more FTL1, compared to the younger mice. Interestingly, the presence of FTL1 also led to fewer connections between brain cells in the hippocampus and diminished cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study&lt;br&gt;      &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further understand if FTL1 was the culprit, the researchers artificially elevated FTL1 levels in young mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they found was striking. They noticed that the brains and behavior of the young mice began to resemble that of old mice. In experiments in petri dishes, nerve cells engineered to make lots of FTL1 grew simple, one-armed neurites — rather than the branching neurites that normal cells create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers lowered the levels of FTL1 in the hippocampus of the old mice, surprisingly, they began to regain their youth. The old mice also had more connections between nerve cells, and also responded to memory tests in a better way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is truly a reversal of impairments. It’s much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms,” Saul Villeda, PhD, associate director of the UCSF Bakar Aging Research Institute and senior author of the paper, said, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also noticed that the FTL1 slowed down metabolism in the cells of the hippocampus in old mice. But the researchers had found a way to combat it. They treated the cells with a compound that stimulates metabolism and prevented these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are optimistic that their work could lead to therapies that block the effects of FTL1 in the brain. “We’re seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age. It’s a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 00:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAJBVV95cUxPaEtxcVhPMEp3dU9lV01MOE9fNkg5X3o1M085SXdVX010bXFQZVZ0VDM5RzlIQUV3bGREd3h1azFwVGk1TkdkenBQeGkyR01yQ2VseEphdVVIakJxRjE0dGRDdkhTeFNVaHlYWnhVRUxic01RZmE1YjJJRm5yNElJX2FtYW56VFJ6MW1kcEFtbDNmQTliY01CUS1nTDNWWkFXTy1kNkdjeEttc0ZSaUZSYm1xTVplbkZJdDJEUHBQQkxoOWcyRTFfVDB6ZUIwZkhmaHVoVkdWaFZxcHBmTUpfaTFjajNTVHA3OTdfMFItQThLYWxEX25mcUV1dl9uX1BGSUZxT0liMjVxbHNVdGRVMA</guid></item><item><title>随着廉价血压药物与致命的乳腺癌作斗争取得突破- Vanguard News</title><link>https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/08/breakthrough-as-cheap-blood-pressure-drug-fights-deadly-breast-cancer/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vanguard News</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 00:19:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNLUQxUXhNQzM3X0xRWmpTYkVobWd0MDNUbVlyZ05LQlhEQVRPY1RmQ0dibEM5T3JPZ2V1eXZyeXNzYVgwMG5icWVmblJuazFHdlpHV0h3V1BGd0NnY0NORnJtNHo2c2hIclkwcjZkZGpDUEp6bEVIRGFXQ1EtMDEzNmQzNHFIWHFVeFhUWlVOSTQyR3ZtY1JXZk1LX0Z5a2FKMHEyeTRvZHM5Z9IBrwFBVV95cUxPR084aE1fSTlENHFuNVRsRXJnLTJKbldDYzhGUW5GVVpBWG1NX0pldmdoa0M5cndVb2VsMVlyYkllV3hvUmgwakNaSTJza0duaGlRaEpaRHJqcHpfcG9vaTI2MGxaUmpscVJYZWh1VzVmUm1YQVdiUkhiNzBkb29UelBJSGZzZWw3R05rakRKaWQ0THVTTWtqZjh2cTNycHNDdHVxT3J1XzVxWXlZczY0</guid></item><item><title>5件与糖尿病药物不太搭配的事情- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/things-that-don-t-mix-well-with-your-diabetes-medications-11795966</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you have diabetes, the focus is often on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating a healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; to better manage the disease and timing your meals with your medications. But understanding what specific foods and drinks interact with your medications is also key. “Diabetes medications are designed to work in a very specific way to help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290068/12-healthy-ways-to-lower-your-blood-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;control your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;,” says&lt;a href="https://baptisthealth.net/academics/residencies-and-fellowships/pharmacy/pgy2-pharmacy-residency-programs/pgy2-ambulatory-care-pharmacy-residency/pgy2-ambulatory-care-pharmacy-residency-preceptors" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; Elaina Rosario, Pharm.D., CPh, BCACP, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. “When you eat certain foods, they can change how your medication is absorbed, how it works in your body, or how quickly it is used up. This can sometimes make the medication less effective, or in some cases, too strong.”

However, this type of interaction isn’t as common since many times the foods in the diet don’t directly affect absorption of the medications. Instead, Emch says that it’s more common that foods eaten work against their intended purpose. “When you take a diabetes medication to lower blood sugar, and then consume foods that cause &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-spike-your-blood-sugar-11762553" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;rapid glucose spikes&lt;/a&gt;, you're essentially creating a tug-of-war in your system,” she says. Other foods like those high in fat may also have an impact.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some dietary fats like unsaturated fats are beneficial for health, but saturated fats in excess are associated with an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/risk-factors-prediabetes-8733895" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increased risk for type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, meals that are high in fat may affect the bioavailability of certain medications. “High-fat foods slow digestion which delays how quickly some medications are absorbed and when they take effect,” says&lt;a href="https://nourishedwithdaria.com/about-diabetes-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; Daria Zajac, RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Examples of high fat foods include whole-fat dairy products, processed meats, fried foods and baked goods like cookies and cake.” Not only can they slow down how fast a medication works, according to Rosario, they can also trigger the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/common-side-effects-of-glp-1-medication-8778573" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;gastrointestinal side effects&lt;/a&gt; of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-foods-high-in-added-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Foods High in Added Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  “Limiting &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-packaged-foods-for-blood-sugar-8747313" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-sugar foods&lt;/a&gt; can help prevent rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar,” says Riker. This is because foods with added sugar may make it more difficult for your diabetes medication to work as intended. Emch points to high sugar foods like candy, sodas and desserts as well as fruit juices as some of the biggest culprits when it comes to foods that work against your diabetes medication. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “These don't stop medications like metformin from working, but they make it significantly harder to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290068/12-healthy-ways-to-lower-your-blood-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maintain stable blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;,” says Emch. “It's like trying to bail water out of a boat while someone else is pouring more water in.” This doesn’t mean avoiding all foods with carbohydrates and sugar. Instead, focus on whole food sources of carbohydrates that are also natural sources of fiber like beans and legumes, whole grains, and whole fruits and vegetables whenever possible. “The quality and quantity of carbohydrates matter,” says Riker.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Highly Processed and Refined Carbohydrates &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Foods that are primarily carbohydrates and are also highly processed like white bread, high sugar cereals, chips, pretzels, crackers and baked goods like croissants, cookies and pies can often cause a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/reasons-for-high-blood-sugar-11741305" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;spike in your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;. “If you take a fast-acting insulin or a medication that works with meals, this sudden spike can make it difficult for the medication to keep up, or it could lead to a sudden drop later if the medication works too aggressively to bring it down,” says Rosario.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “While your diabetes medication is designed to manage blood sugar, it's much easier for it to work effectively when your blood sugar levels are kept more stable.” If you choose to include &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;highly processed or refined carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; in your diet, it can help to pair them with protein or fat as part of a balanced meal. This combination can help to slow digestion which may prevent blood sugar spikes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, most of the diet should not be made up of highly processed carbohydrate sources. “The American Diabetes Association (ADA) specifically recommends that people with diabetes preferentially eat minimally processed sources of carbohydrate that are high in fiber,” says&lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-us/board-of-directors" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Joshua J. Neumiller, Pharm.D., CDCES, FADCES, FASCP&lt;/a&gt;, president of health care &amp;amp; education at the American Diabetes Association.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Medications that are in the class of SGLT2 inhibitors like Jardiance, Steglatro, and Farxiga work by allowing excess sugar to be removed via urine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The diuretic effect of these medications may be compounded by the diuretic effect of excess caffeine. This doesn’t mean a cup of coffee or two will be a cause for concern, but those taking these medications should consider sticking to the recommended limit of 400mg caffeine per day (or approximately three to four cups of coffee).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-alcohol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Alcohol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Alcohol should be limited when taking diabetes medications,” says Zajac. Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach or when skipping meals may worsen the effect it has when taking diabetes medications. “Alcohol increases the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-your-blood-sugar-is-too-low-11746496" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;risk of low blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, especially for those taking insulin or sulfonylureas, since it interferes with the liver’s ability to release glucose into the bloodstream,” says Riker.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Riker also says that alcohol can worsen side effects like nausea and digestive upset when taking medications like metformin. “For those on SGLT2 inhibitors (i.e. Jardiance, Farxiga), alcohol’s dehydrating effects can increase the chances of dehydration, low blood pressure and rare but serious complications like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Following recommendations to limit alcohol is essential when undergoing diabetes treatment. “The ADA recommends that people with diabetes &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-and-your-health-11685623" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consume alcohol in moderation&lt;/a&gt; by limiting intake to ≤2 drinks per day for men and ≤1 drink per day for women,” says Neumiller. “It is important that people with diabetes understand that hypoglycemia can be delayed after drinking alcohol and that blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully to prevent severe low blood glucose levels.” For these reasons, it’s recommended that any alcohol intake is discussed with your doctor pharmacist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With so many diabetes medications available today, it’s difficult to provide one-size-fits-all recommendations when it comes to your diet and food choices. “Your pharmacist is a great resource for understanding how best to take your diabetes medications in relation to meals and if any specific types of foods should be avoided with your prescribed medications,” says Neumiller. These tips can get you started with making changes that work best for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Consider Meal Timing:&lt;/strong&gt; Be sure to time meals and snacks appropriately depending on what’s recommended for your medication as different medications can have different effects. “Some medications need to be taken with the first bite of a meal, while others are taken 30 minutes before, and some are taken with your evening meal,” says Rosario. “Missing the right timing can affect how well the medication works.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Stay Hydrated:&lt;/strong&gt; “Hydration is essential, especially for those on SGLT2 inhibitors like Jardiance or Farxiga, which can increase fluid loss and raise the risk of dehydration or electrolyte imbalance,” says Riker. Drink primarily water and other unsweetened beverages to promote optimal hydration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Consider Portion Sizes:&lt;/strong&gt; Some medications may require paying special attention to portion sizes than others. “For those on GLP-1 receptor agonists such as Ozempic, Trulicity, or Victoza, large or high-sugar meals may worsen nausea or lead to dumping syndrome,” says Riker.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Monitor Your Numbers:&lt;/strong&gt; “A tool that can be used to monitor how foods affect your blood sugar is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heres-why-you-shouldnt-measure-your-blood-sugar-with-your-smartwatch-according-to-the-fda-8601517" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;continuous glucose monitor&lt;/a&gt;,” says Rosario. “They are available with a prescription and over the counter and provide a great insight on how food and your diabetes medications affect your blood sugar levels.” When you monitor your blood sugar, you can identify trends based on the foods you eat and the timing of your medications. “Pay attention to how you feel after eating certain foods. If you notice a pattern of feeling unwell or having unusual blood sugar readings after a particular meal, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian,” says Rosario.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Consider All Medications and Supplements:&lt;/strong&gt; “Other medications and supplements can affect blood sugar or interact with diabetes drugs, so it’s important to consider your full medication list when planning meals,” says Zajac. Pharmacists are an important resource to patients when identifying potential food-drug interactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Managing diabetes requires paying close attention to when and what you eat as well as the timing of your medication. You should adjust your diet to allow room for the foods you enjoy while also limiting those that may cause significant interactions with your diabetes medications like those &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-eating-too-much-sugar-11721349" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in added sugars&lt;/a&gt;, saturated fat, highly processed carbohydrates, and caffeine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Monitoring your blood sugar is the best way to ensure your current plan is working for you. But seeking the care of a registered dietitian or other healthcare provider can be helpful to provide guidance and support, especially if you’re newly diagnosed. “Bottom line, it is important to work with your healthcare professional to be educated on possible side effects of your medication so you can better manage your blood sugar levels and prevent side effects,” says Riker.&lt;br&gt;

Hot pasta is easier to separate, he explained, and plastic breaks down in much the same fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At around 75 degrees, plastic water bottles don't break down all that much. However, people often transport and store water bottles &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/well/eat/plastic-water-bottle-health-microplastics.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in their cars;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;in their cars&lt;/a&gt;, where ambient temperatures can soar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The crucial temperature that that starts to happen in is around 140 to 170°F, which is very normal to get to inside of a hot car in the summertime. It's at that point that it starts to become more likely that you're going to pull particles or chemicals into your water," Tuten said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is that concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Microplastics are particles of plastic smaller than 5 millimeters in size — and while their effects have yet to be fully quantified, a growing body of evidence links them to a number of adverse health impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Their small size allows microplastics to penetrate virtually every part of the human body, as well as soil, the ocean, rivers, and remote areas like Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ongoing research identified potential reproductive impacts, vascular damage, and cancer linked to exposure to microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Wei-Chin Ho, an assistant professor of biology at UT Tyler, cautioned East Texans about a higher risk of microbial contamination in extreme heat. While his warning concerned bacteria, it aligned well with what Tuten discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Just because you can not see [it] does not mean it is not there," Ho said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What can be done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/explore-critical-climate-issues/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Staying aware;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Staying aware&lt;/a&gt; of environmental risks like microplastics is important as scientific understanding of the issue evolves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's difficult to &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/choose-plastic-free-options-for-everyday-products" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avoid plastic entirely;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;avoid plastic entirely&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:using less plastic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;using less plastic&lt;/a&gt; — particularly for personal water bottles and tumblers — is a great way to reduce direct exposure to microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?rec46XrRMPgZfQY79" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for weekly updates on the latest innovations &lt;strong&gt;improving our lives&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shaping our future&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 23:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOTEg0VEoxekc5N2piVmZoRzdvYUFNcl9td3BreDI3RjcySHNoUFhRM3hyUGp5OUQ0dDhXbE5TUXNhUWk4YzRzOC1UR2ZzREFZemNWdGxid2ZONUtaOHZtM3pLLXVYeUxCX2RybFZCM25uRVBadWZsVUJ4RE5xVEM4cHVuRHg4OVZNZWdxMkFKalhkWENR</guid></item><item><title>研究发现， “毒药之王”正在世界各地的稻田中积聚- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/king-of-poisons-arsenic-is-building-up-in-warming-rice-fields-around-the-world/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice feeds billions. It thrives in warm, wet fields and stores energy in a way that fits busy lives and tight budgets. Those same flooded fields can also make arsenic more available to rice plants, and some of that arsenic can end up in the grain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of field evidence points to a new twist: &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/astonishing-global-heat-in-january-2025-defied-climate-expectations/"&gt;as the planet warms&lt;/a&gt; and CO₂ rises, flooded soils lose oxygen more often and for longer stretches. That chemical shift frees arsenic from soil particles, and rice roots take up more of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-climate-rice-and-arsenic"&gt;Climate, rice, and arsenic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of outdoor trials, researchers report that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/world-water-day-2025-preserving-glaciers-protecting-our-future/"&gt;climate conditions&lt;/a&gt; expected by mid-century would increase the flow of inorganic arsenic – the harmful form – from soil to plant to grain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work appears in a leading medical journal and was conducted by teams at Columbia University’s &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mailman School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, with collaborators in China and the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that this increase in arsenic levels could significantly elevate the incidence of heart disease, diabetes, and other non-cancer health effects,” explained &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/lewis-ziska" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Lewis Ziska&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of Environmental Health Sciences at the Columbia Mailman School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-arsenic-is-in-rice"&gt;Why arsenic is in rice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arsenic occurs naturally in many soils and waters. In paddies that stay flooded, oxygen dwindles. Iron minerals that normally bind arsenic dissolve, and arsenic becomes more mobile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmer conditions paired with higher CO₂ push that chemistry along, especially in fields that remain waterlogged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under future settings – temperatures &lt;a href="https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/why-did-ipcc-choose-2deg-c-goal-limiting-global-warming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;more than 2°C&lt;/a&gt; (about 3.6°F) above pre-industrial levels plus elevated CO₂ – the balance tilts toward more inorganic arsenic entering the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That does not make every bowl risky. Local geology, irrigation sources, soil type, and farming practices all shape grain levels. It does mean that the odds can shift in places where paddies stay saturated for long periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-rice-and-arsenic"&gt;Studying rice and arsenic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists did not rely on short greenhouse trials. They grew 28 rice varieties outdoors for roughly a decade using a Free-Air CO₂ Enrichment (&lt;a href="https://ess.science.energy.gov/face/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FACE&lt;/a&gt;) system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process releases extra CO₂ around crops in the open air so that sunlight, wind, microbes, and soil behave as they do in real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those long-running field data then fed into models linking plant arsenic levels to typical rice intake and body size across major &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/feeding-the-world-without-harming-nature-the-complex-balance-of-farming/"&gt;rice-eating countries&lt;/a&gt; in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The projections indicate a sizable shift in risk. Lifetime cancer risks, particularly for lung and bladder cancer, increased by 44% relative to ambient conditions. China alone may face 19.3 million excess cancer cases related to arsenic exposure through rice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a health perspective, the toxicological effects of chronic iAs exposure are well established; and include cancers of the lung, bladder, and skin, as well as ischemic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-kills-differently-now-than-five-decades-ago/"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dr. Ziska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-cancer outcomes also matter. The modeling points to increased risks for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases tied to long-term inorganic arsenic exposure in populations with high rice intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-risks-are-the-highest"&gt;Where risks are the highest&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet and water sources shape exposure. Regions where rice is a daily staple and paddies are often kept flooded will see the largest impacts under warmer, CO₂-richer conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ingesting rice in regions like southern China and Southeast and South Asia is already a significant source of dietary arsenic and cancer risk,” said Dr. Ziska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within countries, irrigation that draws from arsenic-rich groundwater can raise grain levels. Varieties also differ in how strongly they transport arsenic from roots to grain, which creates room for practical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-bad-what-can-be-done"&gt;This is bad, what can be done?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/genetic-fixes-may-save-crops-from-climate-stress/"&gt;Plant breeding&lt;/a&gt; can help: select and develop varieties that limit arsenic uptake even when soils push it toward the roots. Breeders already see large differences among rice lines in how much arsenic reaches the grain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trillions-of-cubic-meters-of-water-is-used-to-grow-crops-each-year/"&gt;Water management&lt;/a&gt; is another lever. Continuous flooding increases arsenic mobility, while giving soils time to drain lets oxygen return, which can hold arsenic in less available forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-harvest steps matter too. Milling and cooking methods can reduce how much arsenic ends up on the plate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No single fix works everywhere. Shifting water regimes, for example, can raise cadmium in some settings, so local testing and tailored management are essential to avoid trading one problem for another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-and-moving-parts"&gt;Limits and moving parts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any mid-century projection carries uncertainty. Policies can bend emissions paths, and farmers adapt as technology and economics shift. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diets change with income, urbanization, and migration. The underlying processes are well established. The decade of fieldwork done for this study adds weight because it includes real weather, pests, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/engineered-plant-microbiomes-the-future-of-crop-protection/"&gt;microbial communities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rice-arsenic-and-human-health"&gt;Rice, arsenic, and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice remains a staple food, and the findings from this research don’t claim that every bowl on every table becomes unsafe. Instead, the scientists point to smarter ways of managing risk and a need to act upstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmers can adjust irrigation where feasible. Breeders can favor varieties that move less arsenic to the grain. Public health agencies can track arsenic in grains and irrigation sources to guide choices in hotspots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study underscores the urgent need for action to reduce arsenic exposure in rice, especially as climate change continues to affect &lt;a href="https://www.nifa.usda.gov/topics/global-food-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;global food security&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dr. Ziska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping rice safe in a warming world is within reach: breed smarter, water smarter, process smarter—and cut emissions, because the air over our fields follows us to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(25)00055-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Lancet Planetary Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 23:54:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQZ3pJbENnR3VuVHZNY2JyWC1EaXZlanJsSVBxbENqWmhNWkJDWDBfUWVjYVdfQ0xqcWpWV0c2NTF5YlRiY3U5eTV0QzJKbEJRVkhUVE0wTElpSmpoYjU2ejNpaWNzcTQ2M2MyaXJ6R1ZSY3U0UVdKSGduZm10RktJckRTd0ZRQ1gyZlMyWE1YUkVFVURiTnNMN0VDM2d4a0V4ak5tSHVHRGlwQQ</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员警告疫情威胁，危险病毒病例增加一倍以上： “我们看到令人担忧的增长” - yahoo.com</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/health-officials-warn-epidemic-threat-235000423.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dozens of cases of a potentially debilitating vector-borne disease have been identified in the United Kingdom this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7419g1l488o" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BBC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; reports, almost twice as many as last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On the surface, this uptick in cases of chikungunya virus might not appear to be concerning in scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In all, &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/chikungunya-virus-uk-symptoms-travel-advice-b2809382.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:73 people;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;73 people&lt;/a&gt; in the U.K. contracted chikungunya, up from 27 in the same span of time in 2024 — a 170% increase in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chikungunya is a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vector-borne illness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vector-borne illness&lt;/a&gt;, infecting humans through mosquito bites.
