Travis Gourley said a maintenance worker found the suspicious device before 9 a.m. in a grassy area at the apartment complex, located in the 10700 block of I-10 westbound near Huebner Road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;The employee took the device to the office and noticed it looked “suspicious,” Gourley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;The employee then called 911. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;“Bomb squad made the scene — they determined the device to be a live device. They decided to make the device safe enough to transport, and it will be transported away from the location,” Gourley said, adding that the device will be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Gourley said the bomb had “black powder leaking out of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Officers evacuated residents within 300 feet and are speaking with residents and witnesses, Gourley said.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6ow279000h3b7afpk8tywt@published"&gt;My 12-year-old son has not seen his father since we divorced and he moved about seven hours north, 11 years ago. Backstory: Both paternal grandparents and all three of his father’s siblings were drug addicts. When I found out that his father was also using drugs, after we had moved across the country to leave behind that toxic situation, I filed for divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="163" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6ow06m000c3b7az9mxajj6@published"&gt;When my son was younger, I always explained his father’s absence by saying, “Your dad loved you so much but knew he wasn’t able to be a parent. He knew that Mommy loved you and would be able to take care of you always.” This felt like an adequate explanation for a small child, and since he rarely asked questions about his father, I never really went any deeper with it. Now that we are nearing the teen years, I feel like I should give him a more fleshed-out history. I also worry about the genetic predisposition to addiction; from a clinical perspective, this information is necessary for the choices he will be faced with making in the upcoming years.&lt;br&gt;Should I bring up this history in our conversations about why his father, or anyone else from his father’s family, is not in his life? I’m worried that telling him will make him feel like he is genetically cursed, potentially making drugs more likely.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6ow7ap000m3b7aq9w7pj8d@published"&gt;But I also worry that not saying it will make it seem like it was a shameful secret we tried to bury. He has a dad who’s been in his life since he was 2, a little brother who adores him. Maybe he just isn’t interested in knowing about a family he never knew.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6owguc00113b7aoy799oyz@published"&gt;You can tell your son the truth. There is nothing inherently shameful about the fact that his father was an addict. Addiction destroys families because it is a personal, physical, and some may even say spiritual sickness that makes its sufferers sacrifice everything they would want to hold dear, including those they love. Addiction is terrible. But it is no more shameful than cancer, and it does not need to be a secret.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6owiza00163b7ae2x3gt72@published"&gt;So if and when your son asks, you can be honest. You can say, “Your father had the disease of addiction, and it made it very difficult for him to show up for you and love you as you deserved to be loved. I’m sure he would have liked to have done better, but he could not. And the good news is that I am able to be here and love you and your dad is able to be here and love you, and we always will.”&lt;/p&gt;

But the unfortunate truth is that the science on this is &lt;a href="http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/genes/"&gt;equivocal&lt;/a&gt; at best. And there is nothing you can say or not say to your son that will guarantee he won’t try drugs, or even become addicted. Obviously this doesn’t stop us from trying. We tell our children that drugs can have a way of ruining lives for some people, many people, and that no one whose life was destroyed ever thought it was going to happen to them. Addiction is cunning, baffling, and powerful. And we hope these words have an impact. And they may. But there is no way to guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6owmgy001g3b7a2knix7mf@published"&gt;As parents we cannot live too far in the future no matter how much we would like to. Right now, today, you have a safe and happy child who is loved and supported. That’s all you need for today. You can be assured that he is off to a much better start and in better hands than his father was.&lt;/p&gt;

We have shared custody in which my son spends every other weekend, parts of the summers, and school vacations with his father. I have always encouraged his father to spend as much time with him as possible, and there have been very few issues regarding custody.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6p0bnz00253b7a39lhv3tj@published"&gt;My son is now 12 and in seventh grade. In our town, he has a choice between two high schools: one that is traditional, and the other is specialized and will teach him a trade. I was curious which school he might like to attend, and he brought up that he’d had this conversation with his father already. Apparently his father and stepmom (who is a foreigner) are encouraging my son to go to a high school in their town and live with them.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6p2atv000u3b7av1yfhy9s@published"&gt;This angers me for two reasons. One, his father should have spoken to me about this before bringing it up to our son. I don’t want to get his hopes up only for plans to fall through. Two, my son has lived with me and my husband his whole life. We have raised him to be a competent, respectful, and helpful young man. But like any 12-year-old, he has his faults. I don’t feel like his overly lenient father can provide him the parenting a teenager will require.&lt;/p&gt;

I feel like they are trying to take my son from me.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s right. He has a choice about where he wants to go to school and also where he wants to live. It’s entirely understandable not to like that. But in this case, not liking something doesn’t make it wrong or unfair.&lt;/p&gt;

And I wonder if and why you feel that way. Nothing in your letter explains why his dad should have less of a right to him than you do. Your kid has two parents. You are one of them. (Surely this can’t be related to your bizarrely xenophobic comment that your husband’s partner is a “foreigner.” You know that “foreigners” also successfully have and raise kids, don’t you?) Your son’s dad has every right to suggest that your son come and live with him in high school. And while I agree that it would have been much kinder of him to bring this up to you before he brought it up to your son, the cat’s out of the bag now.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6p20ci000k3b7aiowvh6kc@published"&gt;Your son is in seventh grade, and he doesn’t have to make this decision for a year. Even though the topic was introduced in a less-than-ideal way, it is good that it’s out in the open. This is a big decision and would require serious transition. Having it introduced now gives everyone a chance to sit with it for a while. Your son may be leaning toward it now, but against it later. You may be leaning against it now, but come around later. Either way, your ex did you all a favor by jumping the gun.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="207" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6p1su3000e3b7aeb2g9vs5@published"&gt;But the one thing I would remind you is that your son’s wishes in this matter should be considered very important, perhaps the most important of anyone’s. You don’t like his father’s parenting style, but there’s no indication that it’s a bad or dangerous one. Just not what you prefer. I’m sure he has some opinions about your choices as well. (As you know, that’s the wonderful world of co-parenting with an ex.) The point here is that your son spends significant time in his father’s household. He comes back happy and in one piece, and is so comfortable there that he’s considering moving there for high school. What is being suggested here is a change in the custody agreement; in most states, courts will take both households into account as well as your son’s preferences as they decide whether or not to grant it. That is, if you want to take it to court. I would remind you that it’s not necessary to do that yet, and probably better not to do it at all. No kid deserves to see their parents fighting one another in court. It’s clear you care deeply for your son, so you should try with all your might to avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;

But if I ask my brother’s fiancée to be one of my bridesmaids, I’m worried that my parents may refuse to pay. My parents and brother are estranged, and have had very limited contact for several years. Their relationship is tumultuous, and I’ve done my best to stay out of it, but frequently I do something that makes my parents think I’ve formed some sort of alliance with my brother. These “infractions” have included attending their daughter’s birthday party, taking photos with her and posting them on Facebook, and going out to dinner with them. This has caused me to also have a somewhat strained relationship with my parents for the past year or so.&lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/06/dear-prudence-wedding-problems-for-wedding-season-who-pays-who-goes-and-who-goes-too-far.html"&gt; I want my brother’s fiancée to be a bridesmaid and their daughter to be a flower girl, but that also has the potential to cause a big problem. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FENNVILLE, Mich. (WOOD) — A person at Fennville High School was recently diagnosed with active tuberculosis, officials say. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No information about the patient’s identity has been released, with officials citing the person’s privacy, but the Fennville Public Schools superintendent said the person has been treated and is expected to be OK. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a Tuesday release, the district and the Allegan County Health Department said they have implemented a “comprehensive and coordinated response plan.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="761ovxjo" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Our top priority is the health and well-being of our students and staff,” Superintendent Albert Lombard said in a statement. “We appreciate the rapid, seamless coordination with the Allegan County Health Department. We are following all expert protocols to ensure this situation is managed quickly, discreetly, and effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="761ovxjo" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The district and health department said they were working to identify anyone who may have spent an extended period of time in an enclosed space with the patient and will reach out individually to anyone who may have been exposed with instructions for testing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are working closing with Fennville Public Schools to ensure that that active and inactive TB cases have access to safe and effective testing and treatment. Although tuberculosis can be a serious condition, it is treatable. Completing treatment is one of the best ways to protect yourself, your family and friends, and your community,” Dr. Richard Tooker, the health department’s medical director, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/keep-mi-healthy/communicablediseases/diseasesandimmunization/tb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a bacterial disease that is often spread when people speak, cough or sing. It does not spread as easily as the cold or the flu, but can be spread among people who are in closed spaces or around each other for an extended period of time. The illness cannot be spread by someone who has inactive TB. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Active TB is diagnosed when a person has a positive test and signs or symptoms, such as an abnormal chest X-ray, night sweats, a cough or weight loss. Officials advised anyone with symptoms to contact their doctor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The district and ACHD stress that while active TB is a serious, contagious condition, it is treatable, and outbreaks are uncommon in U.S. school settings,” the Tuesday release said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year, 165 people in Michigan were diagnosed with TB, according to the Michigan Department of Health. In January, a student at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.woodtv.com/news/kalamazoo-county/1-diagnosed-with-active-tb-found-at-kalamazoo-central-hs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kalamazoo High School was diagnosed with TB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists warn that current requirements may be too low. Credit: SciTechDaily.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even “normal” levels of vitamin B12 may not be enough to protect the aging brain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UCSF researchers found that older adults with lower, but still technically normal, B12 showed slower processing speeds, more white matter damage, and cognitive weaknesses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;When “Normal” Vitamin B12 May Not Be Enough&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting the standard daily requirement for vitamin B12, which is essential for making &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_a15e5d2ae3fd42fd6258493af70006cf" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt;, red blood cells, and nerve tissue, may not provide enough protection for the brain, particularly in older adults. In fact, falling within the “normal” range could still increase the risk of cognitive problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at UC San Francisco studied healthy older adults and discovered that participants with lower B12 levels, even though still considered normal, showed neurological and cognitive weaknesses. These individuals had more damage in the brain’s white matter (the network of nerve fibers that allows different regions of the brain to communicate) and scored lower on tests measuring cognitive speed and visual processing compared with those who had higher B12 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;Annals of Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rethinking Vitamin B12 Guidelines&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to senior author Ari J. Green, MD, of UCSF’s Departments of Neurology and Ophthalmology and the Weill Institute for Neurosciences, the results raise concerns about whether current B12 recommendations are sufficient and suggest that guidelines may need to be revised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Previous studies that defined healthy amounts of B12 may have missed subtle functional manifestations of high or low levels that can affect people without causing overt symptoms,” said Green, noting that clear deficiencies of the vitamin are commonly associated with a type of anemia. “Revisiting the definition of B12 deficiency to incorporate functional biomarkers could lead to earlier intervention and prevention of cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;

The richest natural sources are animal-based foods such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products. For those who follow vegetarian or vegan diets, B12 can be obtained through fortified foods like breakfast cereals, plant-based milks, and nutritional yeast, or by taking supplements to ensure adequate intake.

&lt;h4&gt;Low B12, Slower Thinking, and Brain Lesions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers enrolled 231 healthy participants without dementia or mild cognitive impairment, whose average age was 71. They were recruited through the Brain Aging Network for Cognitive Health (BrANCH) study at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their blood B12 amounts averaged 414.8 pmol/L, well above the U.S. minimum of 148 pmol/L. Adjusted for factors like age, sex, education and cardiovascular risks, researchers looked at the biologically active component of B12, which provides a more accurate measure of the amount of the vitamin that the body can utilize. In cognitive testing, participants with lower active B12 were found to have slower processing speed, relating to subtle cognitive decline. Its impact was amplified by older age. They also showed significant delays responding to visual stimuli, indicating slower visual processing speeds and general slower brain conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRIs revealed a higher volume of lesions in the participants’ white matter, which may be associated with cognitive decline, dementia, or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Implications for Prevention and Future Research&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the study volunteers were older adults, who may have a specific vulnerability to lower levels of B12, co-first author Alexandra Beaudry-Richard, MSc, said that these lower levels could “impact cognition to a greater extent than what we previously thought, and may affect a much larger proportion of the population than we realize.” Beaudry-Richard is currently completing her doctorate in research and medicine at the UCSF Department of Neurology and the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In addition to redefining B12 deficiency, clinicians should consider supplementation in older patients with neurological symptoms even if their levels are within normal limits,” she said. “Ultimately, we need to invest in more research about the underlying biology of B12 insufficiency, since it may be a preventable cause of cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since the February 2025 publication, the findings have sparked wide discussion among researchers and clinicians. Several reviews have reinforced the link between low-normal vitamin B12 and subtle neurological damage, pointing out that current guidelines may underestimate the brain’s true requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commentators have called for raising the cutoff for deficiency and shifting toward measuring biologically active B12 (holo-transcobalamin) rather than total serum levels, as even “healthy” amounts may leave older adults vulnerable to cognitive decline and white matter damage. Early reports also highlight associations between low active B12 and elevated neurodegeneration markers such as tau protein, strengthening the case for redefining what counts as adequate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO — The Chicago Department of Health is encouraging Chicagoans to get vaccinated as respiratory virus season kicks up — and that includes the latest COVID-19 shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city health department has endorsed the vaccination standards set by the Illinois Department of Health for this year’s flu season, recommending everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated against flu, the vast majority of people get vaccinated against COVID-19 and some people get RSV immunization.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They mark a rare break with federal recommendations, as vaccine advisers under federal Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have not recommended the COVID-19 vaccine for anyone — but didn’t recommend against it, instead saying that &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/acip-recommends-covid19-vaccination-individual-decision-making.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;“individual decision-making” should determine if someone gets the shot.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illinois offering its own standards was “necessary because the federal government is no longer following its rigorous scientific review processes for vaccine-related decisions,” according to the state health department. The guidelines come out of a “detailed review” by the Illinois Immunization Advisory Committee of state and federal data, guidance documents and other recommendations, according to a press release from the city’s health department. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Respiratory season, which occurs between November and March, &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/respiratory-season" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;encompasses the time of the year when most respiratory infections happen.&lt;/a&gt; These infections can include the common cold, flu, COVID-19, pneumonia and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Health Department will provide free updated flu and COVID-19 vaccines for Chicago residents throughout the season at its immunization clinics. &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/clinical_health/immunization_clinics.html?utm_source=sfmc&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CDPH+Vaccine+Guidance+2025-26&amp;amp;utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fwww.chicago.gov%2fcity%2fen%2fdepts%2fcdph%2fsupp_info%2fclinical_health%2fimmunization_clinics.html&amp;amp;utm_id=1389291&amp;amp;sfmc_id=82406958" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; for clinic locations and hours and to register; walk-ins are accepted, but registration is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting Monday, COVID-19 vaccines are available at the city clinics for people 12 years and older. COVID-19 vaccines are not yet available for children younger than 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vaccination guidelines: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flu vaccines are recommended for everyone 6 months and older.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;COVID-19 vaccines are recommended for
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All children 6 months-23 months.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;All adults 18 and older.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Children ages 2-17 who have at least one underlying risk factor, never been vaccinated for COVID-19 before or live with at-risk individuals.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Children ages 2-17 whose parents/guardians want them to get a COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;All pregnant people, those who are planning to get pregnant, those postpartum and those lactating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;RSV vaccines are recommended for
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All adults 75 years and older.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;All pregnant people during 32-36 weeks of pregnancy.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;All infants up to 8 months old entering their first RSV season whose mother did not get an RSV vaccine during pregnancy. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Children 8 months-19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Adults ages 50-74 who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

One of those study participants died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;In another study, one participant (again out of 2,500) developed Guillain-Barré syndrome nine days after receiving the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;In one &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/168889/download?attachment" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.fda.gov/media/168889/download?attachment" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="study" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on Abrysvo of over 18,500 people, one person developed Guillain-Barré syndrome seven days after they were vaccinated, while another developed Miller Fisher Syndrome, which is a rare form of Guillain-Barré syndrome, eight days after they received the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;You can develop Guillain-Barré syndrome from other causes, making it tricky to pin it to the vaccines. “Given the small number, it is unclear whether the vaccine caused these events, or whether they occurred due to chance,” Dr. Adalja said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Both the FDA and CDC’s advisory committee thought that these cases were probably coincidental, but that’s something that people are keeping an eye on,” Dr. Schaffner said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="28" data-lazy-id="P0-19"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Is the RSV vaccine safe to get?" data-anchor-id="is-the-rsv-vaccine-safe-to-get" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emt9r7s1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0"&gt;Is the RSV vaccine safe to get?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;On the whole, doctors said the vaccine is safe. “The RSV vaccine is very safe based on the clinical trial data,” Dr. Adalja said. “The risk-benefit ratio favors it in the approved groups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Schaffner agreed. “The vaccine is safe,” he said, adding that both he and his wife get it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Ultimately, Dr. Russo said that choosing to get the RSV vaccine comes down to your individual risk-benefit ratio. “There’s little question that if you’re 60 and older and you have significant underlying cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, or other significant comorbidities, the benefits of vaccination really outweigh any potential risks,” he said. “Those people should get vaccinated. RSV can be as deadly as influenza.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But, Dr. Russo said, if you’re “perfectly healthy” and over 60, he recommended talking to your healthcare provider about whether you should receive the vaccine. “Certainly in high-risk groups, there’s little question where the benefit exceeds a potential and ill-defined risk," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="33" data-lazy-id="P0-20"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Is there anyone who should not get the RSV vaccine?

Without that guidance, the chain required patients to have a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Walgreens will allow anyone aged six months or older to get a COVID-19 booster as long as they discuss it with a pharmacist, a Walgreens spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why has guidance on COVID-19 boosters changed so much recently?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;There is a three-step process for vaccines to become available in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;First, the Food and Drug Administration must approve a vaccine for use nationwide. For the 2025-2026 COVID vaccine, the FDA approved the booster for those 65 and older, along with those between 6 months old and 64 years old who have an underlying health condition, Rupp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Then, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices decides on guidance for how to use the vaccine, Rupp continued. The committee, which is typically made up of virologists and infectious disease experts, reviews studies and data to make a recommendation on who should get certain immunizations and how often, along with dosage amounts, Rupp added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;On Sept. 19, the committee — also known as the ACIP — made a rare &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/acip-recommends-covid19-vaccination-individual-decision-making.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;recommendation that was not in alignment with the FDA&lt;/a&gt;, Rupp said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;ACIP approved the vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older, regardless of whether an individual has an underlying health condition, according to a news release from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“They did say, ‘We want to highlight the greatest benefit to receiving the vaccine if you’re under 65 is if you have an underlying health condition, and you should have that conversation with your physician,’” Rupp said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“They were really careful to call that out — that it’s best for people who have an underlying condition if they’re under 65," he said, “but they didn’t say it’s only approved for people who have an underlying health condition if they’re under 65, which is what the FDA did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Once ACIP makes its recommendation, the director of the Centers for Disease Control will review that guidance and determine the official CDC recommendation for the country, Rupp added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The interim director of the CDC has not yet adopted ACIP’s recommendation, so Utah providers could not adopt the committee’s guidance yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;But the Division of Professional Licensing’s recent letter allows Utah providers to adopt ACIP’s guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“It is now much more of an option for many people,” said state epidemiologist Leisha Nolen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“But I would say it probably will take a few days, if not a week, for a lot of the pharmacies to get the stock in place, [to] get ready to do this,” Nolen added. “So I would still suggest people call ahead and make sure that where they’re intending to go has the vaccine ready and are able to administer it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 12:13:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFA0bGRmemRFZzgxbDdUc3dOLUlmaFZ5ZWRES3A5Sy1nVlNRc2l4VU1uSVBOeU92dnZUQktTQ3lNY0tDSk5rRm1Xb2dQLWpPX2xzZWJ3WU5yUC1XQjJTdERUNjRiU0tFd21yNHRfTkxnWGhoM1BNSkhrUzZZd3c</guid></item><item><title>Jill Martin关于乳腺癌基因检测的研究- TODAY.com</title><link>https://www.today.com/health/jill-martin-breast-cancer-update-genetic-testing-rcna233417</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d5ac98" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jill Martin is the TODAY lifestyle contributor and founder of By Jill Martin. In 2023, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/jill-martin-breast-cancer-diagnosis-rcna94105" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;she was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Now, she’s raising awareness about genetic testing and helping to fund breast cancer research through her brand, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jillmartin.com/pages/warrior-shop?srsltid=AfmBOopGB330SP5NzSE8YVPTvYHHamMOFvKgCQ6w_gplUzJu2QL_7Npb" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Warrior Effect.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Ahead of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/breast-cancer/pink-power-day-2025-rcna229282" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pink Power Day on the TODAY Plaza Oct. 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Martin opened up to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://today.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; about her life now as a cancer survivor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-269845" class="body-graf"&gt;As soon as I received the diagnosis of Stage 2 breast cancer in July 2023, I immediately went into fight or flight mode. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7ec837" class="body-graf"&gt;My life was suddenly centered around beating cancer and what I needed to do. I agreed to the recommended treatments, including a double mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation, two reconstructive surgeries and surgery to remove my ovaries and fallopian tubes to prevent ovarian cancer. I focused on ticking each therapy off the list, and that dedication carried me through cancer treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-549386" class="body-graf"&gt;Today, the intense and terrifying treatment is over, and I am cancer-free. Yet, my fight is now focused on a new goal. I'm still undergoing treatment to prevent breast cancer from returning, but it’s focused on medications I can take at home. I’m on a hormone blocker to stop my body from producing estrogen, as well as a targeted therapy that helps prevent the recurrence of cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-45d6b1" class="body-graf"&gt;While not as intense as some of the other treatments I received, these medications still cause side effects, including extreme joint and bone pain, which I continue to navigate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-94a288" class="body-graf"&gt;This past spring, I also had a revision to my reconstructive surgery. Radiation changes the skin, so I experienced some complications after the first surgery. It was my sixth surgery in two years. Luckily, my doctor said I am finished with surgery — and now, I can focus on healing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-8f12b6" class="body-heading"&gt;Looking Back and Moving Forward &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-24fdd1" class="body-graf"&gt;Finally, I have the space to process all of the emotions that I felt throughout my breast cancer treatment. At times, it's tough to grapple with what I’ve been through. When I reflect on that time, I remember constantly going from treatment to treatment, feeling as though I was fighting for my life. I also have quiet moments when I confront the emotions of being a cancer patient and now, a survivor. While thinking about what I’ve overcome helps me feel resilient, it's also overwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-da6f22" class="pullquote" data-testid="pullquote-medium"&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote__quote" data-testid="pullquote-quote"&gt; I choose to be the victor, not the victim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0c1a55" class="body-graf"&gt;I’m living in my new body, and I am grateful for the way my body fought for me. But it will never look the same. This part of my body that I used to think of as sexy is now the badge of honor from a battle I fought and won. I’m glad that I’m not in pain and I don’t have cancer, but my body is a reminder that I am a changed person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b812b7" class="body-graf"&gt;I’ve also learned to balance my life. I dedicate 33% of my time to work, 33% to giving back and 33% to Jill time. When it’s my time, I might take a walk or call a friend — just do something that nourishes me. I live with more intentionality, and I ask myself whether something serves me before I decide to pursue it. This transformation has been one of the unexpected gifts I received from having cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-8cf5b9" class="body-heading"&gt;From Fighting Back to Giving Back &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-63b031" class="body-graf"&gt;Today, I am focused on launching the &lt;a href="https://jillmartin.com/pages/warrior-shop?srsltid=AfmBOopGB330SP5NzSE8YVPTvYHHamMOFvKgCQ6w_gplUzJu2QL_7Npb" target="_blank"&gt;Warrior Effect&lt;/a&gt;, a brand that highlights the cancer journey by donating proceeds to the Breast Cancer Research Fund (BCRF). Every day when I wake up, I have to decide between pulling the covers over my head, or moving forward. I choose to be the victor, not the victim. Every time I face a difficult moment, my strength improves, and I become more resilient. To me, that is the "warrior effect" that we all have. But for many of us, we need to learn to embrace it and let it carry us through our days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ff537e" class="body-graf"&gt;I wanted to create a brand that honors the cancer journey and the strength of people going through it while also giving back. Beginning October 1, 2025, all month, a portion of proceeds from every item sold — including exclusive Warrior Collection essentials and select officially licensed NBA and WNBA pink logo products — will be donated to BCRF. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-e8a44e" class="pullquote pullquote--small" data-testid="pullquote-small"&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote__quote" data-testid="pullquote-quote"&gt;Research saves lives, and I’m honored to be helping in my way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3cf70d" class="body-graf"&gt;I’m alive and sharing my story thanks to research. Every new advancement in breast cancer screening and treatment comes from research. Research saves lives, and I’m honored to be helping in my way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-62f165" class="body-graf"&gt;While the Warrior Effect will help scientists studying breast cancer, I’m also passionate about genetic testing. So to encourage others to learn everything they can about their health, I'm hoping to bring people together to sign up for genetic testing for &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/breast-cancer/pink-power-day-2025-rcna229282" target="_blank"&gt;Pink Power Day&lt;/a&gt; on Oct. 1 on the TODAY Plaza. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4f1d0d" class="body-graf"&gt;Knowledge is power. I believe it’s essential that women understand their breast cancer risk and undergo genetic testing if they can. If I had known I carried the BRCA 2 mutation earlier, I could have avoided chemotherapy and radiation and ongoing treatment. Early detection doesn’t simply save lives; it changes them. I hope others can avoid the challenging treatments I experienced after my diagnosis by finding out about their breast cancer risk early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3053df" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;My life has changed in both earth-shattering and beautiful ways. At times it's felt catastrophic. But I’m still here, focused on enjoying life and helping others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOczZoT1NiUVF2QTY4NTY5bTlTdm80NEhEcXZUWW0xNzMwanVQSW1kTFdqU3E5TXBxQkR3SU15d3JVOVNnb09SUWk4cFRMTjg4SVlfOGl1aUV1SW5POWtIM0NYNy1xQkR0RVlGZUdCY0JJdF9EUENfd3hvM3RmUG53ekktX1FDNm5wSGttcjFHcFVKZ9IBVEFVX3lxTE9sWThEd1hncGJ4Wi1ZREJRR1VLbGIzTTExSVRaN2pXZkFPTEdGZGhuMmtlNXF5S1h3QXdFNEZxaGVMcXlneUVncDFUY2ZLZVQ4V2NBZw</guid></item><item><title>新变种“Nimbus”和“Stratus”导致新冠肺炎病例上升- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rv3y9jnryo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 jRDKjj"&gt;Covid cases rising with new variants Nimbus and Stratus&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-c4820dd1-0 cYDsPh"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-c4820dd1-11 bxdaHR"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-c4820dd1-5 iYeVyy"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-c4820dd1-7 dbQBRo"&gt;Michelle Roberts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="undefined-role-location" class="sc-c4820dd1-8 evcqcz"&gt;Digital health editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 ERpRj"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6e6b/live/d5c5e630-9dea-11f0-b3aa-f94b46cdf49f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6e6b/live/d5c5e630-9dea-11f0-b3aa-f94b46cdf49f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6e6b/live/d5c5e630-9dea-11f0-b3aa-f94b46cdf49f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6e6b/live/d5c5e630-9dea-11f0-b3aa-f94b46cdf49f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6e6b/live/d5c5e630-9dea-11f0-b3aa-f94b46cdf49f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6e6b/live/d5c5e630-9dea-11f0-b3aa-f94b46cdf49f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6e6b/live/d5c5e630-9dea-11f0-b3aa-f94b46cdf49f.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6e6b/live/d5c5e630-9dea-11f0-b3aa-f94b46cdf49f.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A young man, who looks unwell, sits on his sofa, wrapped in a blanket, resting his head in one hand, while holding a tissue in the other.

This can offer good protection, even against the new variants, says the UK Health Security Agency  (UKHSA). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It is urging people to book their vaccinations against flu and another common winter virus called RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) as cases start to increase ahead of winter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It's normal for viruses to mutate and change, and as more data becomes available on these variants,  we'll have a better understanding of how they interact with our immune systems and how to optimise our protection, as well as actions we can take to keep the most vulnerable safe and live our lives as normally as possible," says the UKHSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"The most important thing is for those eligible to get their vaccination when it is due."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It's possible to catch Covid again even if you have had it very recently, or have been vaccinated. Reinfections are usually mild, but you can feel unwell and still spread the virus to others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Covid tests are no longer widely available for free, but pharmacies still sell them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;A number of High Street chemists and private clinics sell Covid vaccines too. The cost varies, with some charging around £99 for a single dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 11:58:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5tVWVmMGpvODhCRUpEU3g3dzRaeHp0aVd2NzhqWG5XZzFmVURfMmo1bkZIbVk1QTVEM1lFc0plRFpJMEp5Z0FnSXlfVTFfWkloY0JtRHJZUTNaQdIBX0FVX3lxTE5ObVJfMkhWQVJkS0szaEFXYzAtRGF5NzRKSkxPRVV6aVpsM3Izb09kekdPb2xhSUxPdXIxWVFMUWk3RE1aay1yLWxzWjhBLTFad1NxMVhxM0V1dHR0NXNV</guid></item><item><title>如何获得最佳的夜间睡眠：科学所说的-大自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03148-8</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;p&gt;From TikTok videos touting mouth tape and weighted blankets, to magazines ranking insomnia-curbing pillows, sleep advice is everywhere. And it’s no wonder. People all over the world complain of insomnia and not getting enough sleep, driving a market for sleep aids worth more than US$100 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But scientists warn that online hacks and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00965-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00965-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;pricey tools&lt;/a&gt; aren’t always effective. And failed attempts to remedy the situation could have negative effects, says Andrew McHill, a circadian scientist at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University in Portland. “It could discourage people from finding help, and things could get worse,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02225-2" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03148-8/d41586-025-03148-8_51235262.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How the brain wakes up from sleep — and produces that morning feeling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, researchers point to the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22736" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22736" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;lessons coming from circadian science&lt;/a&gt;, which over the past five decades has exposed a network of biological clocks throughout the body. This timekeeping machinery ensures that physiological systems are primed to do the right things at the right times — such as defend against pathogens, digest food and sleep. But circadian clocks don’t cycle precisely on their own. To stay in sync and function optimally, they need regular calibration from sunlight, daily routines and other cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern life doesn’t often cooperate. People spend much of their time indoors. They eat late into the night. They &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00723-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00723-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;shift sleep schedules between workdays and weekends&lt;/a&gt;, effectively jet-lagging themselves. The toll is steep. In the short term, circadian disruption and insufficient sleep can reduce cognition, mood and reaction time. In the long term, they can increase risks of infections, diabetes, depression, dementia, cancer, heart disease and premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01044-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01044-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;For better sleep&lt;/a&gt; and overall health, McHill and other scientists emphasize three basics: contrasting light and dark, consolidating mealtimes and keeping sleep times consistent. “Simply taking a walk outside during the day and reducing our light exposure in the evening could have great effect,” says McHill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Seek contrasts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light provides the most powerful signal to the circadian system. Blue wavelengths are especially potent. That is not a coincidence. Humans evolved outdoors, under the sky. And the midday sky is rich in blue light. Still, common advice about avoiding blue light at night captures only part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s and 2000s, a string of discoveries proved the existence of light-sensitive cells in the eye that are not directly involved in seeing&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Rather, these cells &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/458142a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/458142a" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;synchronize body clocks&lt;/a&gt;. They detect both intensity and wavelength, with input from rods and cones, and relay those data to a circadian pacemaker in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circadian system requires bright light to operate properly. “But we’re pretty bad at determining how much light we’re getting,” says Jamie Zeitzer, a sleep and circadian scientist at Stanford University in California. Typical home lighting of 100–250 lux might feel like a lot to the eye. But the blue-rich daylight that the circadian system is primed to detect shines orders of magnitude brighter — upwards of 10,000 lux even on an overcast day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timing matters, too. Bright blue light during the daytime synchronizes circadian rhythms and supports the nightly surge of melatonin — the hormone signal that tells the body it’s time to sleep. It can also directly boost alertness and cognitive performance. The same illumination at night, from artificial lights and glowing screens, confuses the circadian system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01044-9" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03148-8/d41586-025-03148-8_50831204.png"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Unlocking the secrets of sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blue light is the strongest disruptor, but enough photons of any colour at night can shift rhythms, suppress melatonin levels and hinder sleep. Exposure in the middle of the night, such as with a flip of a toilet light switch, is most disruptive, says Zeitzer. The circadian system’s sensitivity peaks near the midpoint of sleep, when it least expects light. Studies show that even dim light, such as a hallway bulb, can raise overnight heart rate and impair sleep&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, scientists say, what matters most is contrast: bright days and dark nights. In fact, light during the day can buffer against the potential harms of light at night, says Mariana Figueiro, director of the Light and Health Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Mounting research links greater daytime light exposure with stronger circadian rhythms and higher sleep quality. One study of college students found that their total hours of light exposure during the day better predicted their bedtimes and wake times than did light exposure after dusk&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “The more light you get during the day, the better you’ll sleep at night,” says Figueiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too little daylight and too much night light could even shorten life expectancy. A UK study of nearly 90,000 people found that the 20% with the poorest light-exposure patterns were predicted to die around five years earlier than were the 20% with the healthiest habits, even after accounting for factors such as income and physical activity&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Phillips, a sleep health scientist at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, and an author of the study, pins the explanation on circadian rhythms: “They regulate every aspect of your physiology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, achieving this daily contrast is difficult in the modern world. Indoor lighting leans on green wavelengths that serve vision but not circadian signalling. Energy-usage codes limit how bright those fixtures shine. Daylight entering through windows gets quickly diluted. And energy-efficient window glass and blue-light-blocking spectacle-lens coatings further reduce how many circadian-stimulating photons reach the eyes. Ageing compounds the problem; people’s lenses become more yellow over time and filter out more blue light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circadian science’s prescription: spend more time outdoors, sit near windows and use daylight-mimicking light-emitting-diode lamps during the day. In the evening, lower the brightness of lamps and power down screens — or use apps that dim or shift screens to a warmer spectrum. And consider a low-intensity amber night light for the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists note that the precise prescription is personal. Even &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01402-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01402-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;people of the same age can vary considerably&lt;/a&gt; in how they respond to the same light, possibly because of characteristics such as sex or eye colour. And when light comes from screens, the content can matter as much as the light itself. “If you’re on an iPad at 11 at night, then the light exposure might have some effect,” says Zeitzer. “But if you are doing something relaxing, that might outweigh the effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Consolidate calories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calorie intake is also intricately linked with circadian rhythms and sleep. The human liver at 10 a.m. and the human liver at 10 p.m. are very different organs. The same can be said for other parts of the body that process food. Hunger hormones, digestive enzymes and glucose-regulating insulin have rhythms, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans are simply not equipped to deal with food at all hours, says Emily Manoogian, a circadian scientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, California. Late morning to early afternoon is when the body is usually most prepared for incoming calories. Eating late in the evening disrupts clocks and leaves key steps of digestion incomplete. It can also disrupt the gut microbiome, which could contribute to insomnia&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. What’s more, late meals send blood to the gut and raise core body temperature, countering the natural night-time dip that promotes sleep. And they elevate glucose levels and uncouple liver and kidney clocks from the core clock in the brain, raising the chance of midnight toilet trips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manoogian and others suggest reviving the old adage: eat like a king in the morning, a prince at noon and a peasant at dinner. That last meal, they say, should fall at least three hours before bedtime, ideally with no subsequent snacks or caloric drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01910-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03148-8/d41586-025-03148-8_51209366.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Revealed: how the brain turns stress into a bad night’s sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food quality matters, too. Diets high in sugar and saturated fat lighten and fragment sleep. Caffeine lingers for hours. And alcohol is deceptively disruptive: “You might fall asleep, but the quality of your sleep will be quite poor,” says Manoogian. On the flip side, eating some plant-based foods during the day could improve sleep. Research shows that walnuts boost melatonin levels and sleep quality&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Marie-Pierre St Onge, a nutrition, sleep and circadian scientist at Columbia University in New York City, co-authored a study that links greater daytime intake of fruits and vegetables with less-fragmented sleep&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be it a cool iced coffee or warm cup of soup, the temperature of what we eat and drink may influence our mental and digestive health, according to new research led by San Diego State University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S000711452510514X" target="_blank"&gt;British Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, examined more than 400 Asian and white adults across the United States. Researchers found that food and beverage &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/temperature/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt;, long recognized in traditional Asian medicine, has measurable links to anxiety, insomnia, and gut discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the findings, among Asian adult participants, higher summer cold drink consumption was associated with increased anxiety, more sleep disturbances, and greater feelings of abdominal fullness. In contrast, white participants who drank more hot beverages in winter reported lower levels of depression, improved sleep quality, and fewer digestive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study in the U.S. to directly link cold and hot dietary consumption to multiple health outcomes, with important implications for addressing rising rates of anxiety, insomnia and digestive issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Something as simple as the temperature of what we eat and drink can have real impacts on health," said Tianying Wu, SDSU associate professor of epidemiology, and the study's lead author. "Because cold and hot consumption is such a routine part of daily life in the U.S., at home and in restaurants, the findings have broad relevance to everyday health choices."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was based on data from SDSU's Healthy Aging Survey, which investigates novel risk factors and health disparities among U.S. populations.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The study also found that the effects were most pronounced in participants who frequently reported "cold hands," a possible indicator of reduced circulation. Subgroup analysis showed that Chinese participants, who consumed the least cold foods and drinks, experienced fewer adverse outcomes, while Asian Indians showed stronger associations between cold consumption and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adverse+health+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adverse health effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Western nutrition guidance rarely considers the temperature of food and drinks, the results, according to the researchers, echo long-held practices in traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, which warn against excessive cold consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research provides a snapshot of how hot and cold consumption may relate to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+outcomes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health outcomes&lt;/a&gt;," said Wu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The next step is to conduct more rigorous prospective and intervention studies, since the effects can be dynamic—for example, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; or individuals with poor circulation may be especially vulnerable to cold exposure."&lt;/p&gt;

(Getty Images/iStockphoto)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, among people aged 70 to 79 who took part in the study, their FEV1 decreased by an average of 0.12 litres among those using solid fuels, such as indoor wood burners, compared to 0.07 litres among those not exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team found that self-reported wood fuel use increased from 10 per cent in 2004/05 to 18 per cent in 2021/22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Horsfall told the Congress: “We know wood burning at home emits harmful air pollution both indoors and outdoors including known carcinogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite this, air pollution from this source has approximately doubled in the UK since 2009 as more people install and use wood stoves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, the link with health outcomes in high-income countries is not well understood and residential areas with high emissions are hard to identify using existing air quality monitoring networks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: “We found that people using solid fuel had lower rates of smoking and lung disease, which can mask the true effects of solid fuel exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, using repeated lung function measurements over an eight-year period, we found that lung function declined faster among solid fuel users compared to non-users, even after adjusting for socioeconomic and housing factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests an important link between solid fuel use and respiratory decline, despite the healthier baseline of the exposed group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study suggests that high levels of particulate matter from stoves damage respiratory tissues, causing inflammation in a similar way to cigarette smoke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers will now investigate whether people living in or near areas with a high concentration of wood stoves, such as the wealthier parts of London, also show increased rates of respiratory issues, such as inhaler prescriptions and hospital visits for lung conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 tBUPS"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/02/06/11/newFile-7.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/02/06/11/newFile-7.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/02/06/11/newFile-7.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Experts found wood burning appliances are more commonly used by white people in affluent city neighbourhoods, even within Smoke Control Zones, they reported at the European Respiratory Society Congress in Amsterdam." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-416852"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Experts found wood burning appliances are more commonly used by white people in affluent city neighbourhoods, even within Smoke Control Zones, they reported at the European Respiratory Society Congress in Amsterdam.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the new study, Sarah Sleet, chief executive at Asthma and Lung UK, said: “The findings of this research aren’t surprising, but do help to add to the body of evidence of the impact of air pollution from wood burners on our lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s concerning that the numbers of homes with a wood burner is increasing and primarily the reason for having a wood burner is the aesthetic of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully this research causes people to question if the payoff of having a wood burner is worth it, for the detrimental impact it could have on you and your family’s lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would be good to see increased awareness on the impact of wood burners, with clearer information and guidance from the Government on the health impact, as well as increased regulation around domestic wood burning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Ane Johannessen, head of the European Respiratory Society’s expert group on epidemiology and environment, added: “In Europe, we are seeing a growing trend for using wood-burning stoves at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research in other parts of the world, where traditional wood burning is used in the home, has shown that this is harmful and causes asthma, COPD and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that wood burners used in European homes may have similar effects and should be considered a potential environmental risk factor when assessing respiratory health, especially in patients with unexplained lung function decline or chronic respiratory symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although new eco-design European wood-burners are generally considered cleaner and safer than more traditional wood stoves, many European homes still employ older wood burners, and even the newer stoves may not be entirely risk-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study underscores the need for clearer public health guidance and regulation around domestic wood burning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People should be aware that these stoves could be harming them and their families, and doctors should be asking their patients about whether they are using stoves at home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 09:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxOd2NnblZmb29IR2NybkhCcUFVN1pORndaLVBQVDZ0S2VFQUQ1ejVkRHVld0lTY0hpN1haRERoU2tVY1Nla09rUnJvR184VWNNNXpyTWdyOHBRdDRYX21Fako1OU5selJsTWM0bkdqeUc3Ujl5M2hOZFNzWXRHYnA2YWVUWkVMdUVQSS1palNJTVpqM0hHekE</guid></item><item><title>牛油回来了吗？宾夕法尼亚州中部餐厅表示，改用PennLive提升了销售额。- PennLive.com</title><link>https://www.pennlive.com/food/2025/09/is-beef-tallow-back-switching-to-it-has-boosted-sales-central-pa-restaurants-say.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X4XB2R7EXND7NID3HSYNH6FHD4"&gt;At&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/p/DOUGH-n-JOE-61553427128529/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.facebook.com/p/DOUGH-n-JOE-61553427128529/"&gt;

One photographer roamed the city's financial district amid an eerie emptiness.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;There had been hope that Covid-19 would have ebbed away in the northern hemisphere by the end of summer in 2020. Instead, a new wave of the disease appeared in earnest towards the end of August. In little more than a month, it would spark new lockdowns in the UK – and again plunge once-busy city centres into an eerie emptiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Some blame was directed at a government programme called &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67658106" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;"Eat Out to Help Out"&lt;/a&gt;, which urged people to dine on subsidised meals at local pubs and restaurants. Held from 3-31 August 2020, the scheme was enormously popular as visitor numbers in the venues taking part soared by &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54015221" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;more than 50%&lt;/a&gt; compared to the previous August, before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But with the diners came Sars-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The number of confirmed Covid-19 infections, which had been dropping, started to rise again.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;a bold step towards tackling the HIV epidemic, the Ministry of Health and Wellness is now considering a pilot programme for the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved injectable HIV prevention drug, lenacapavir.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug has been described by former United States President Bill Clinton as “a genuine chance to end” the global epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaica’s decision to embark on the pilot was revealed by Dr Nicola Skyers, senior medical officer of the National HIV/STI programme in the Ministry of Health, who explained that there are also plans for the roll-out of cabotegravir, another injectable form of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), taken once every two months for the prevention of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Skyers, lenacapavir, which is to be administered twice a year, will be available free of cost in the public health system. That was confirmed by Health and Wellness Minister Dr Christopher Tufton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The current thought is to do that, but a lot depends on what turns out in the pilot, and how it evolves over time, but the thought is have it free in the public health system because we’re targeting vulnerable groups and that represents a particular segment of the population,” Tufton, who is on assignment overseas, told the &lt;b&gt;Jamaica Observer&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Skyers noted that the ministry’s push for the pilot comes even as it accepts that the cost of the injectable antiretrovirals (ARVs) “is quite prohibitive at this point”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have injectables for prevention, and we have injectables for treatment, two different target groups, and we are exploring both,” she told the &lt;b&gt;Observer &lt;/b&gt;on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In terms of prevention, yes, the pilot will be done. That is cabotegravir. Lenacapavir is more of a treatment-based one, but for both injectables in general, we are looking at pilots. We would focus on persons who are most at risk for use, and then certainly, as the pricing becomes within our budget, we can scale up the use,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization (WHO), lenacapavir offers a highly effective, long-acting alternative to daily oral pills and other shorter-acting options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Skyers noted that the injectable HIV prevention and treatment drugs will be particularly impactful as Jamaica is “not a pill-taking country”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I definitely see that [lenacapavir] as a benefit, but we don’t like needles either, so we have to also create that balance, but I believe that overall it can have a significant impact if we get more persons on it, especially for younger persons who might not be as adherent to the pills,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For older persons, they are quite comfortable; they have been taking [pills] for diabetes, taking them for hypertension. So we do find that our older persons are actually doing better because they are more cultured towards taking pills, so they tend to do well,” Dr Skyers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, really, the injectables would be addressing the issues we have around adherence [because] you’re taking an injection every three or six months, depending on which medication we are talking about. And it covers you for that period, so certainly it will address some of the issues that we’re having with adherence,” Dr Skyers added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenacapavir is set to be rolled out at the end of this year in the United States at a cost of US$28,000 per person annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, 120 low- and middle-income countries will have access to the groundbreaking HIV treatment and prevention drug in 2027 at a reduced cost of US$40 per person each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This follows an agreement reached between the Clinton Health Access Initiative co-founded by the former US president, the Gates Foundation, and Wits RHI to partner with Indian manufacturers to scale up the production and distribution of lenacapavir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, 1.3 million new HIV infections were recorded worldwide and experts have said that lenacapavir could have a transformative effect on that figure as it almost completely prevented new cases of HIV in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, the WHO recommended it as a preventive drug or PrEP, with the WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus describing it as “the next best thing” to an HIV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, two young Jamaicans with whom the &lt;b&gt;Observer&lt;/b&gt; spoke said they would be willing to take lenacapavir as an added HIV protection measure if made available at a reduced cost rather than the daily oral pill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would choose the injection because it is only twice per year as compared to the pill, which you have to take daily. Sometimes you may forget, and not everybody likes swallowing pills,” said a University of the West Indies (UWI) student who gave her name as Angel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While noting that she may not be able to afford the pill at the initially announced cost of US$28,000, Angel shared that if the cost is reduced, then she would choose the injectable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The young people would opt to take it because I am pretty sure nobody wants to contract HIV. It’s not something that goes away; it is a lifetime disease, so I think the young people would want to take the necessary precautions so as not to get this disease,” Angel added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anishka, another UWI student, said that she would consider taking the injectable HIV prevention drug as it would be more convenient than oral PrEP pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It would be something that I would consider because the disease, in general, is very detrimental, and I think taking the proper precaution and step as a young adult is very necessary for the benefit of my health and my future generations to come… Seeing that you would have to take [oral] PrEP more often than the injection, I would be more open to injectable drugs than having to remember to take this pill every day,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jamaica, there are about 26,000 HIV/AIDS-positive individuals, according to the joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 2023 report.&lt;/p&gt;

The same outcome was reached in England and Wales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The SMC decided they did not offer value for money, partly because of the cost of delivering them, which includes needing extra scans and appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Henry Simmonds says that on its own the NHS in Scotland is never going to have enough money or the right approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"The difficulty is that dementia research funding comes as part of the NHS funding, and the NHS hasn't been set up as an innovator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We're way behind where the science and the innovation is, and we'd like to see a bit of thinking done about how we can move that forward and close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"So we need to work together with government to really sell Scotland as the place to come to invest in research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The UK government, which is investing hundreds of millions of pounds in dementia research, should give Scotland a fair share of that investment to help build more partnerships between private companies, universities and the NHS, according to Mr Simmonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The trial Roy is taking part in is being run by Scottish Brain Sciences, a private company that delivers clinical research into Alzheimer's disease, funded by pharmaceutical companies, at no cost to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Tipping point&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Dr Meher Lad, their clinical lead, says THN391 is at the very beginning of the journey for a drug being approved for wider use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It's an early study to find out whether the drug is safe and can be tolerated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"After this, bigger, broader studies around the world will test whether it works and alters people's memory and thinking for the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It gives me hope that it opens the door for newer therapies that might be more appropriate for the NHS in Scotland and beyond."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Dr Lad says it is just one of many recent exciting developments in dementia research, and the challenge now is to think about how to deliver the benefits to many more patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"There's been a lot of development in terms of blood tests that can detect Alzheimer's disease at an early stage, and now it's time to move that into the clinic so we can help people who are suffering from memory and thinking problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"And I think we are perhaps at the tipping point where we can make this happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;A spokesperson for the Scottish government said it was working to deliver a ten-year dementia strategy and provides £46m annually to fund "vital" clinical trials for such diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The UK government said it was also investing in clinical trials and backing ground-breaking research to help diagnose, as well as support, people living with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 05:13:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE90SE1XQ1FnT0hjeUFNY3pyZmlWbHl0TnZ2dVh2b00waTJlZmNFcHhRVHlOR1RvUWdnZjlOOWs1aHlVTnBTa1BnQURJc0YtR3JCS1UxX3ZvczRWd9IBX0FVX3lxTFA0MHlBRDd5Sncxd19XcnFrMjdvSHdiNllTbGprcXRDUDNNQWtVbFZ4eGk1WkdkanBiUl9SYkhSV2ZCOVhyYWx6dUpNamoxazNFSndqUzRjVWcyUGZ3RTNB</guid></item><item><title>症状出现前数年发现的类风湿性关节炎迹象- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/signs-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-uncovered-years-before-symptoms-appear</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;After years of research, scientists have discovered that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt; is often preceded by a silent, symptomless stage. Catching the autoimmune disorder earlier could mean lessening the painful joint inflammation and damage, or even stopping its progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people who develop rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are deemed at risk years before the appearance of joint inflammation (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovitis"&gt;synovitis)&lt;/a&gt;, due to the presence of anticitrullinated protein  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="175541" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; (ACPAs) in their blood. However, not everyone with ACPAs develops RA, and it hasn't been clear why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest study reveals new warning signs doctors could use to identify who is most at risk, which include inflammatory proteins in the blood and the behavior of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-immune-system-weighs-the-same-as-a-pineapple-study-finds"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; (which drive RA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/arthritis-affects-thousands-of-kids-and-one-piece-of-advice-is-crucial"&gt;Arthritis Affects Thousands of Kids, And One Piece of Advice Is Crucial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is the work of a US team, led by researchers from the Allen Institute of Immunology, the University of California, San Diego, and the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU Anschutz).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results support the concept that RA inflammatory disease begins well before the onset of active synovitis, earlier than clinically appreciated," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adt7214"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has implications for decisions about when to initiate preemptive treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers followed the progress of 45 individuals determined to be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/shocking-study-says-no-cold-isnt-making-your-joints-ache-so-whats-going-on"&gt;at risk of RA&lt;/a&gt; based on being ACPA positive, 16 of whom went on to develop full RA. Together with data from healthy controls, this gave the team a host of biological comparison points to look at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the blood of the at-risk participants, proteins linked to the immune system were much more abundant and active, while &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"&gt;B cells&lt;/a&gt; (which make antibodies) and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"&gt;T cells&lt;/a&gt; (which coordinate B cells) showed signs of being in a higher stage of alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closer to an RA diagnosis, the number of T cells and B cells primed for inflammation action increased, including T cells that would otherwise be more neutrally configured.

If part of it is removed or injured, healthy liver cells multiply to rebuild the tissue. This ability is why liver transplants can succeed and why organs like the heart don’t recover the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the catch: years of heavy drinking can rob the liver of this regenerative power. People with alcohol-related hepatitis or advanced cirrhosis develop scarring and liver failure, and sadly, stopping drinking doesn’t always reverse the damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers compared healthy livers with those affected by alcohol damage. They found that liver cells try to switch into repair mode, but get stuck in a half-functioning state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re not fully mature liver cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They aren’t becoming the “stem-like” cells needed to regrow tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s like being halfway up a ladder—unable to climb up or down. These semi-functional cells add pressure on the remaining healthy cells, causing the liver’s repair system to falter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;RNA splicing problems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every cell uses RNA as instructions to make proteins. In damaged livers, RNA splicing—the process that edits these instructions—is broken. Think of it like trying to edit a movie but putting all the scenes out of order. The result? Proteins that don’t work in the right place, and liver repair grinds to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified ESRP2, a protein that helps with RNA splicing, as missing in damaged liver cells. Without ESRP2, the liver’s “repair instructions” fail, stopping regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm this, researchers studied mice without ESRP2 and found the same type of liver damage seen in humans with alcohol-related liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inflammation makes it even worse&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol-damaged livers become inflamed. Immune and support cells flood the liver with chemicals that suppress ESRP2, compounding the problem. In lab experiments, blocking one of these inflammatory pathways restored ESRP2 levels and fixed RNA splicing, showing a promising path for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew that the liver stops functioning and stops regenerating in patients with alcohol-related hepatitis and cirrhosis, even when a patient has discontinued consuming alcohol, but we didn’t know why,” said U. of I. biochemistry professor Auinash Kalsotra, who co-led the study with Duke University School of Medicine professor Anna Mae Diehl. “The only real life-saving treatment option once a patient reaches the liver failure stage in those diseases is transplantation. But if we understood why these livers were failing, maybe we could intervene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this could mean for the future&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research opens doors for new therapies for alcohol-related liver disease.

			&lt;p&gt;Imagine knowing in your 20s or 30s that you carry a gene that will cause your mind and body to slowly unravel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease is inherited, relentless, and fatal, and there is no cure. Families live with the certainty of decline stretching across generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new treatment is being &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevz13xkxpro"&gt;widely reported&lt;/a&gt; as a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-gene-therapy-slows-huntingtons-disease-by-75"&gt;Breakthrough Gene Therapy Slows Huntington's Disease by 75%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, gene therapy company uniQure announced that a one-time brain infusion appeared to slow the disease in &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-from-pivotal-phase-i-ii-study-of-amt-130-in-patients-with-huntington-s-disease-1035197551"&gt;a small clinical study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, this would not only be a landmark for Huntington's disease but potentially the first time a gene therapy has shown promise in any adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the results, which were announced in a press release, are early, unreviewed, and based on external comparisons. So, while these findings offer families hope after decades of failure, we need to remain cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Huntington's disease?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huntington's is a rare but devastating disease, &lt;a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/dementia/dementia-in-aus/contents/what-is-dementia/less-common-dementias"&gt;affecting&lt;/a&gt; around five to ten people in 100,000 in Western countries. That means &lt;a href="https://hdna.com.au/hd-prevalence-study/"&gt;thousands in Australia and hundreds of thousands worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/huntingtons-disease"&gt;Symptoms&lt;/a&gt; usually start in mid-life. They include involuntary movements,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="175825" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, irritability, and progressive decline in thinking and memory. People lose the ability to work, manage money, live independently, and eventually care for themselves. Most die ten to 20 years after onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is caused by an expanded stretch of certain DNA repeats (CAG) in the huntingtin gene. The number of repeats strongly influences when symptoms begin, with longer expansions &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(93)90585-E"&gt;usually linked&lt;/a&gt; to earlier onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175844" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175844" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/huntingtons_genes_642-1.jpg" alt="huntington's gene" class="wp-image-175844 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/huntingtons_genes_642-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/huntingtons_genes_642-1-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175844" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Huntington's disease is caused by repeated sequences in the DNA. (Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Looking for a treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gene that causes Huntington's disease &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(93)90585-E"&gt;was identified&lt;/a&gt; in 1993, 32 years ago. Soon afterwards, mouse studies showed that switching off the mutant huntingtin protein even after symptoms had begun could &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80623-6"&gt;reverse signs and improve behaviour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggested lowering the toxic protein might slow or even partly reverse the disease. Yet for three decades, every attempt to develop a therapy for people has failed to show convincing clinical benefit. Trials of huntingtin-lowering drugs and other approaches did not slow progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the new treatment?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-time gene therapy, called AMT-130, involves brain surgery guided by  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="175825" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt;.

(&lt;a href="https://sites.uab.edu/mgraylab/huntingtons-disease/"&gt;University of Alabama at Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus carries a short genetic "microRNA" designed to reduce production of the affected &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abb8920"&gt;huntingtin protein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By delivering it straight into the brain, the treatment bypasses the blood–brain barrier. This natural wall usually prevents medicines from entering the central nervous system. That barrier helps explain why so many brain-targeted drugs have failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did they find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 29 patients received treatment, with 12 in each group (one low-dose, and one high-dose) followed for three years. According to uniQure, those given the higher dose declined much slower than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study compared how much participants' movement, thinking, and daily function declined, compared to a matched external group from a global Huntington's registry (meaning they weren't part of the study). The company claimed those given the higher dose had a 75% slowing in their decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a functional scale focused on independence, the &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-from-pivotal-phase-i-ii-study-of-amt-130-in-patients-with-huntington-s-disease-1035197551"&gt;company reported&lt;/a&gt; a 60% slowing in decline for the higher dose group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other tests of movement and thinking also favoured treatment. Nerve-cell damage in spinal fluid was lower for study participants than would be expected for untreated patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why should we be cautious?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are an early snapshot of results reported by the company, not yet peer-reviewed. The study compared treated patients to an external matched control group, not people randomised to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="175825" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; at the same time. This design can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jncimonographs/lgae046"&gt;introduce bias&lt;/a&gt;. The numbers are also small – only 12 patients at the three-year mark – so we can't draw solid conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company reports the therapy was generally well tolerated, with no new serious adverse events related to the drug since late 2022. Most problems were related to the neurosurgical infusion itself, and resolved. But in a disease that already causes such severe symptoms, it is often hard to know what counts as a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company uniQure has said it plans to seek regulatory approval in 2026 on the &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-from-pivotal-phase-i-ii-study-of-amt-130-in-patients-with-huntington-s-disease-1035197551"&gt;basis of this dataset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators will face difficult decisions: whether to allow access sooner before all the questions and uncertainties are addressed – based on the needs of a community with no effective options – and wait for further data while people are being treated, or to insist on larger trials that confirm results before approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does it mean?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If upheld, these results represent the first convincing signs that a gene-targeted therapy can slow Huntington's disease. They may also be the first evidence of benefit from a gene therapy in any adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder. That would be a milestone after decades of failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these results do not prove success. Only larger, longer, and fully peer-reviewed studies will show whether this treatment truly changes lives. Even if approved, a complex neurosurgical gene therapy may not be easily accessible to all patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has said the drug's &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/first-gene-therapy-seems-slow-huntington-disease"&gt;price&lt;/a&gt; would be similar to other gene therapies – which can &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vzek4dkyyo"&gt;cost over&lt;/a&gt; A$3 million per patient – and will have the added cost of brain surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For families who carry this gene, the hope is profound. But caution is just as important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may be witnessing the first credible step toward slowing an inherited adult-onset neurodegenerative disease, or just an early signal that may not hold up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, only time and rigorous science will show whether this treatment delivers the benefits so urgently needed.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266062/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yogurt is a great source of high-quality protein, with some options having up to 25 grams per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-protein yogurts are usually strained, use ultra-filtered milk or contain whey or plant-based protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose yogurts with little to no added sugar—ideally less than 3 grams per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yogurt is one of those foods that can truly do it all. Enjoy it on its own as a high-protein snack, pair it with sweet or savory foods, or use it as a creamy base in smoothies and dips.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It doesn’t stop there—yogurt is full of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut-friendly probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, essential nutrients like calcium and vitamin D and, of course, protein. What makes it unique is that yogurt protein is digested a little differently than other foods. Thanks to fermentation, its amino acids are more bioavailable, meaning your body can absorb and use them more efficiently.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, protein levels in yogurt can vary widely depending on the style and processing method. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7917455/what-is-skyr/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Strained (Greek-style) and skyr yogurts&lt;/a&gt; tend to have more protein than traditional yogurt, while some brands boost their yogurts with added protein sources. So, which one is worth grabbing? To help you choose, we asked dietitians to share their favorite high-protein yogurt picks.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All yogurt naturally contains protein—it comes from milk, after all—but these stand out with an impressive 10 to 25 grams of protein per serving. Here are our top picks of dietitian-approved, high-protein yogurts, ranked from highest to lowest: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.worthyofwellnessllc.com/rds" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jessica Villalvir, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt; recommends &lt;a href="https://ratiofood.com/products/vanilla-protein-dairy-snack?id=41859603628164" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ratio High Protein Yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, which delivers a whopping 25 grams protein in a 5.3-ounce container—more than double what you’ll find in many other yogurts. To reach that level, Ratio relies on ultra-filtered milk along with added whey protein concentrate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s also a low-sugar option, with just 3 grams of sugar per container; most flavored yogurts have much higher amounts of added sugar. But it does uses sucralose, which some people choose to avoid, as an artificial sweetener.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Each 6.7-ounce container has 20 grams of protein sourced entirely from cultured low-fat milk, making it a good option for those who want to avoid added protein powder.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It also comes in unique flavors like key lime, black cherry and currant—made with real fruit and natural flavors, rather than artificial ones. While it does contain slightly more added sugar (about 6 to 7 grams per serving), it’s a solid choice for those who prefer to skip artificial sweeteners but still want a touch of sweetness in their yogurt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thick, creamy and surprisingly rich for a nonfat option, &lt;a href="https://usa.fage/products/yogurt/fage-total-0" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fage Total 0% Plain Greek Yogurt&lt;/a&gt; proves you don’t need fat for great texture. “It’s a good source of protein and works well topped with fruit and nuts or as a savory option with cucumber and herbs,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vandanasheth.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Vandana Sheth, RDN, CDCES, FAND&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A standout option is &lt;a href="https://siggis.com/product/plain-nonfat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Siggi’s Simple Ingredient Skyr&lt;/a&gt;, which packs 16 grams of protein in a 5.3-ounce cup. &lt;a href="https://www.farmingtonvalleynutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Woodman, RD&lt;/a&gt;, recommends it for its straightforward ingredient list and variety of nonfat, low-fat and whole-milk options.  With just cultured milk and live active cultures, it’s a great pick for anyone who prefers to keep their yogurt as simple as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Made with just cultured nonfat milk and live active cultures, a 5.3-ounce serving of plain &lt;a href="https://www.oikos.com/all-products/triple-zero/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Oikos Triple Zero&lt;/a&gt; provides an impressive 15 grams of protein—all for just 90 calories. It’s tasty on its own, but also works as a lighter swap for sour cream in dishes like tacos, chili and baked potatoes. Plus, it’s an easy protein boost in smoothies and oatmeal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plant-based yogurts are often low in protein and high in sugar—but not &lt;a href="https://kite-hill.com/products/vanilla-unsweetened-greek-yogurt" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kite Hill Greek-Style Plant-Based Yogurt&lt;/a&gt;. Made with almond milk and soy protein isolate, it delivers 15 grams of plant-based protein per 5.3-ounce serving. It’s also free of added sugars, using stevia for sweetness instead. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although it provides a solid protein boost, it does fall short on nutrients commonly found in dairy yogurt. “While it doesn’t provide much calcium, vitamin D or B12, it does offer a moderate amount of iron and fiber,” says &lt;a href="https://www.diabetesteam.com/writers/683f0deb46c7aa1e0f3349e2" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Avery Zenker, RD, M.A.N&lt;/a&gt;.  Plus, it’s available in five flavors, including plain, mango, mixed berry, strawberry and vanilla.

Fruit on the Bottom&lt;/a&gt; is another dietitian favorite, thanks to its high protein content and real fruit. Each 5.3-ounce serving contains 13 grams of protein and zero grams of sugar; it’s sweetened naturally with stevia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietitians appreciate the added fruit at the bottom of every container. With flavors ranging from strawberry to blueberry lemon, it’s a tasty option for everyone.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live and Active Cultures&lt;/strong&gt;. “For gut-health support, look for key words such as ‘live and active cultures’ in the ingredients,” says &lt;a href="https://signup.usenourish.com/providers/claudia-salinas?referralSource=Nourish+dietitian&amp;amp;referralName=Claudia+Salinas&amp;amp;utm_source=Nourish_dietitian&amp;amp;utm_term=Claudia_Salinas&amp;amp;fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAae4ao2S8g6VPZOYzubm1yI2vzyQ4sZIOdWHvZ_7dKkjZTiz7mk631f2NiMyAA_aem_pXPrPV1JJ_aKF23JShxzwQ" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Claudia Salinas, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. Because heat can destroy beneficial bacteria during processing, this labeling ensures that the yogurt contains at least 10 million CFUs per gram of viable bacteria at the time of manufacturing and no less than 1 million CFUs per gram by the best-by date.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low or No Added Sugars&lt;/strong&gt;. Sugar content can vary widely, with some varieties having up to 20 grams per serving. To keep added sugar low, choose yogurts labeled ‘0 grams of added sugar’ or those with 3 grams or less per serving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat Content&lt;/strong&gt;. While the extra fat can make yogurt more satisfying, it also adds extra calories—especially when paired with toppings like peanut butter, nuts or granola. Choose a fat content that fits within your personal health goals, whether that’s nonfat, low-fat or full-fat varieties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At Least 10 Grams of Protein&lt;/strong&gt;. Zenker recommends choosing a yogurt with at least 10 grams of protein to support satiety and muscle repair. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yogurt is a delicious and nutritious way to boost your protein intake—if you choose wisely. Strained (Greek-style) and skyr yogurts are naturally higher in protein, while some other yogurts increase their protein through ultra-filtered milk or added whey or plant-based protein. For the healthiest choice, dietitians recommended choosing a yogurt that provides at least 10 grams of protein, contains live and active cultures and keeps added sugars to a minimum. &lt;br&gt;

Lead investigator &lt;a href="https://www.bordeaux-neurocampus.fr/staff/giovanni-marsicano/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Giovanni Marsicano&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt; (UB), supervised the research alongside collaborators in Bordeaux and Moncton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mitochondria-linked-to-energy"&gt;Mitochondria linked to energy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside each neuron, mitochondria convert nutrients and oxygen into ATP, the cell’s spendable energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That reaction, called oxidative phosphorylation, keeps electrical signals firing and helps keep memory circuits stable, and it is already a focus of clinical &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-024-01839-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;strategies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also see energy shortfalls early in diseases like Alzheimer’s, well before many neurons die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large human &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abk1051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; showed widespread cellular stress and mitochondrial dysfunction across the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stopping-alzheimers-before-it-starts-early-treatment-shows-potential/"&gt;Alzheimer’s brain&lt;/a&gt;, consistent with early bioenergetic failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, it was hard to tell if failing mitochondria cause &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-molecules-unexpectedly-store-their-own-memory/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; loss or simply show up as collateral damage. The new work attacks that question directly by turning the organelle up, then watching behavior change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-switch-for-cellular-power"&gt;New switch for cellular power&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team built on chemogenetic tools called &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(16)00065-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DREADDs&lt;/a&gt; that let scientists turn engineered receptors on with a lab-made drug and leave everything else alone, a method well known in neuroscience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They redesigned a stimulatory receptor so it sits on mitochondria, then named it mitoDREADD-Gs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When activated, this receptor triggers &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK518966/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;G proteins&lt;/a&gt; inside the organelle to kickstart energy production. The design lets researchers press a precise biochemical button without changing thousands of other cellular parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning on mitoDREADD-Gs rapidly raised mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption in brain tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mechanistically, the switch boosted intramitochondrial &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3870303/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cAMP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33167377/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PKA&lt;/a&gt;, a pathway known to tune respiration from within the organelle, as shown by classic cell biology &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2684673/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results-of-the-study"&gt;Results of the study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group first tested a known form of amnesia triggered by tetrahydrocannabinol, the active compound in cannabis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That impairment relies on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabinoid receptors&lt;/a&gt; located on mitochondria in the memory center, the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With mitoDREADD-Gs turned on in hippocampal neurons, the THC-induced recognition memory deficit (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9855787/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RMD&lt;/a&gt;) disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animals explored the new object again, a simple behavioral readout tied to long-term memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then moved to disease models. Mice that model frontotemporal dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, both showing early hippocampal bioenergetic defects, recovered recognition memory when their mitochondrial activity was temporarily boosted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is the first to establish a cause-and-effect link between mitochondrial dysfunction and symptoms related to neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that impaired mitochondrial activity could be at the origin of the onset of neuronal degeneration,” explained Marsicano&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-memory-and-mitochondria"&gt;Human memory and mitochondria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is a hub for forming and stabilizing long-term &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-does-the-human-brain-create-retrieve-memories-engram-cells-connections/"&gt;memories&lt;/a&gt;. It depends on a steady ATP supply to maintain synaptic strength during the hours after learning, when fragile traces become durable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy deficits hit this process hard. If oxidative phosphorylation slows, neurotransmission weakens, plasticity fades, and cells compensate poorly, especially in aging or disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new tool increased assembly and activity of complex I in the respiratory chain, a bottleneck for electron entry that shapes ATP output. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That local, reversible boost was enough to normalize behavior in two distinct dementia models, a strong sign that bioenergetics sit upstream of the memory symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-does-not-prove-yet"&gt;What it does not prove yet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These experiments were done in mice and used viral delivery of engineered receptors alongside a designer drug. That is not a therapy for people, and safety would need rigorous study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short bursts of extra respiration helped, but constant stimulation may carry risk. Excess energy flux can increase reactive oxygen species, strain quality control, and stress vulnerable neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings therefore map a mechanism and a target, not a ready-to-use treatment. Any clinical translation would need careful dosing windows, specific &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-mapping-research-mouse-neurons-revolutionary-advance/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; regions, and long-term monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-neurons-mitochondria-and-memory"&gt;Neurons, mitochondria, and memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many current approaches try to coax cells to make more mitochondria, ship healthy mitochondria into damaged tissue, or scavenge oxidative byproducts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews highlight growing tests of such strategies in animals and early trials in several diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study offers a different angle, a way to tune the existing power plants quickly and locally inside neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By working with endogenous signaling, it avoids permanent genomic edits and keeps the intervention reversible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work will probe how long the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-link-pupil-dilation-to-brains-working-memory-levels/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; rescue can last, which cell types drive the effect, and whether similar bioenergetic tuning could help other cognitive domains beyond recognition memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the answers continue to line up, mitochondria could shift from bystanders to central targets in the fight against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02032-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 03:14:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNMFhzLTVBYk5WU29uOTRyZE1icFREbkZ2N0hVM0dZQVFvV3U0Y3M3V19jU2pselJ2Rl9QWHZTVFdnTmt3S1lrN3hEOGZoN1VrenAxUVJsT01sbmRQYXBTcWpPTm9DV0hxeWVfaURzYldKdW9PY1FCZnJpQUZZMG1nYmNTSTJLZWlmeTBtVjMtYTlOOC1FTVE</guid></item><item><title>科学家警告：常见维生素D补充剂具有“以前未知”的负面影响- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-warn-common-vitamin-d-supplement-has-previously-unknown-negative-effect/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content cf entry-content content-spacious"&gt;

Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study shows that vitamin D2 may reduce vitamin D3 levels, suggesting D3 is the more effective supplement for immune and overall health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study conducted by the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/university-of-surrey/"&gt;University of Surrey&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/john-innes-centre/"&gt;John Innes Centre&lt;/a&gt;, and the Quadram Institute Bioscience suggests that taking vitamin D2 may actually lower the body’s levels of vitamin D3, which is considered the more effective form of the nutrient. Many people use vitamin D supplements to maintain bone strength, support the immune system, and follow the UK government’s advice of 10 micrograms (µg) per day, particularly during the colder months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is available in two main supplement forms: D2 and D3. The researchers observed that when individuals take vitamin D2, it can cause a decline in vitamin D3 levels. Unlike D2, vitamin D3 is the type that the body naturally makes when exposed to sunlight, and it is also the form most efficient at boosting overall vitamin D status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrition Reviews&lt;/em&gt;, are based on an analysis of randomized controlled trials. The results showed that people taking vitamin D2 experienced reduced vitamin D3 levels compared with those who did not take D2 supplements. In several cases, vitamin D3 levels dropped even lower than in the study’s control groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Brown, PhD Research Fellow and Lead Researcher of the study from the University of Surrey’s Nutrition, Exercise, Chronobiology &amp;amp; Sleep Discipline, said: “Vitamin D supplements are important, especially between October and March, when our bodies cannot make vitamin D from sunlight in the UK. However, we discovered that vitamin D2 supplements can actually decrease levels of vitamin D3 in the body, which is a previously unknown effect of taking these supplements. This study suggests that, subject to personal considerations, vitamin D3 supplements may be more beneficial for most individuals over vitamin D2.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Cathie Martin, Group Leader at the John Innes Centre, said: “This meta-analysis highlights the importance of ensuring plant-based vitamin D3 is accessible in the UK.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;D2 and D3: Not Interchangeable&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research supports a previous study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.790444/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Frontiers in Immunology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, led by Professor Colin Smith from the University of Surrey, which suggests that vitamin D2 and D3 do not have identical roles in supporting immune function. Vitamin D3 has a modifying effect on the immune system that could fortify the body against viral and bacterial diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Colin Smith said: “We have shown that vitamin D3, but not vitamin D2, appears to stimulate the type I interferon signalling system in the body – a key part of the immune system that provides a first line of defense against bacteria and viruses. Thus, a healthy vitamin D3 status may help prevent viruses and bacteria from gaining a foothold in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research into the different functionalities of vitamin D2 and D3 should be a priority in deciding whether vitamin D3 should be the first-line choice of vitamin D supplement, subject to individual requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Martin Warren, Chief Scientific Officer at the Quadram Institute, said: “Vitamin D deficiency represents a significant public health concern, especially during the winter months, with significant deficiency across the UK population. This collaborative research effort aligns well with the Quadram Institute’s mission to deliver healthier lives through food innovation to enhance the nutrient density of the food we eat. Tackling this with the most effective form of vitamin D supplementation or fortification is of the utmost importance to the health of the nation.”&lt;/p&gt;

They say parvo can remain in the environment for weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can survive the harsh winters of Maine and likely is present in most dog parks across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parvo is a serious illness that is highly contagious and can be fatal to dogs if left untreated, or if treated too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, the virus attacks white blood cells and the gastrointestinal tract of dogs and other canids like coyotes, wolves, and foxes. In puppies, the virus also can damage the heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="FacebookEmbed_facebookEmbed__BS4MU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus can cause severe vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and shock, which can lead to death within a few days if not treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canine parvovirus is easily spread by direct contact with infected dogs, contact with feces from infected dogs, or contact with virus-contaminated surfaces like kennels, food and water bowls, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccination is highly effective at preventing the virus when administered as directed by veterinarians. Puppies are most vulnerable to the virus, but older dogs that are unvaccinated and/or have compromised immune systems are at risk also.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials say if your dog is not up to date on vaccines or hasn't completed a vaccine series, do not take them to places like dog parks or highly dog trafficked areas. Please call your vet to get a vaccine for your dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your dog is experiencing symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and extreme lethargy, please quarantine them from other dogs immediately and seek veterinary attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WGME</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 23:59:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgJBVV95cUxORUhVRmNHUS1WMlNRTVRwa2l5dS02QUUzUDVRWE9oWTdvR29HWlV0ajAzSG9vLTVFOUFpLUt2SWZldV9fS2tyd2U5ZzBaeGRaSHJCYkJEUUw4d1dmNU9hTngzYndyeGQ4b0JXQ3gwRldHUnhmY3FrVk9OYm9jcHVqbHZzOFBVaUZRYWUxb1JzbzZ1SXo4ak9xRGRsQzBDOF9CU01MX1hTajhiblhEb1VuYTNIVnczeXV2cUhsNkVFczdISEJybEotRjlWRWZOVDhBMjRyNzN0c3I3TjdMRnF1U01kOVkxSFJiQTktNWxHbzRLaHNiZzYyMEhGRkJ0TENKallWV3dn</guid></item><item><title>加巴喷丁不顾风险使用飙升， CDC分析显示- MedPage Today</title><link>https://www.medpagetoday.com/neurology/generalneurology/117705</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content-region mpt-article-page" id="js-main-content-region" itemtype="http://schema.org/articleBody" itemid="#main-content-region"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2010 to 2024, prescriptions jumped from 79.5 to 177.6 per 1,000 people, according to Gery Guy Jr., PhD, of the CDC National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, and co-authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of persons who received gabapentin soared from 5.8 million in 2010 to 15.5 million in 2024, Guy and colleagues reported in &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-01750" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That represented an increase from 18.9 per 1,000 people in 2010 to 46.9 per 1,000 people in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prescribing rates doubled between 2010 to 2016, but increased at a slower rate from 2016 to 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although the rate of increase in gabapentin prescribing slowed after 2016, gabapentin prescribing is still increasing and was the fifth most prescribed medication in the United States in 2024, compared with the 10th most prescribed in 2017," Guy and colleagues wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since 2016, some &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-021-07314-2" target="_blank"&gt;states have implemented policy changes&lt;/a&gt;, including enrolling gabapentin in prescription drug monitoring programs and reclassifying it as a schedule V controlled substance, which likely reduced gabapentin prescribing in those states," they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabapentin is approved for seizures and postherpetic neuralgia; gabapentin enacarbil is approved for restless legs syndrome. Despite limited indications, gabapentin and its cousin pregabalin are &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/neurology/generalneurology/108370" target="_blank"&gt;widely prescribed off-label&lt;/a&gt; for various other pain syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common side effects of gabapentin include drowsiness, dizziness, blurry or double vision, and difficulty with coordination and concentration. In 2019, the &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/neurology/generalneurology/84019" target="_blank"&gt;FDA warned about serious breathing problems&lt;/a&gt; that may occur in patients using gabapentin or pregabalin who have respiratory risk factors. These factors included taking opioids or other drugs that depress the central nervous system, conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that reduce lung function, and older age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The increase in gabapentin prescribing from 2010 to 2024 reveals recent evidence of the continued uptick of gabapentin use in the United States," said Tasce Bongiovanni, MD, of the University of California San Francisco, who wasn't involved with the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Careful attention to the use of gabapentin  --  both new and persistent prescribing  --  is crucial, especially in older adults who are also taking opioids due to potentially dangerous side effects when taken in combination," Bongiovanni told &lt;em&gt;MedPage Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Patients should be counseled on these side effects and careful consideration should be taken to weigh the risks of benefits of starting or continuing the medication," she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="module-group columns-group" data-preset="body-illustrated-list" data-type="synopsi" data-title="Medical News from Around the Web" id="recirculation-article-body" data-count="3"&gt;
                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guy and co-authors analyzed data from the IQVIA National Prescription Audit and Total Patient Tracker all-payer pharmaceutical databases, evaluating prescribing trends and the number of people dispensed gabapentin from 2010 to 2024. The IQVIA databases capture 94% of retail pharmacy-dispensed prescriptions in the U.S., they noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad flex-ad" data-pos="bodytext" data-slot="text5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women (57.1 per 1,000) and adults ages 65 and up (114.7 per 1,000) were dispensed gabapentin at higher rates in 2024 compared with 2016. Prescribing to older adults rose by 33.7% from 2016 to 2024  --  more than any other age group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary care clinicians prescribed the most gabapentin in 2024, at 22.6 per 1,000 persons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, gabapentin prescribing among advanced practitioners (nurse practitioners and physician assistants) surged over the course of the study, from 2.5 per 1,000 persons in 2010 to 19.5 per 1,000 persons in 2024. This may reflect expanded prescribing authorities in certain states, but warrants further study, Guy and colleagues noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prescriptions dispensed outside of retail pharmacies (in hospitals or long-term care facilities, or through mail-order pharmacies) were not captured, the researchers acknowledged. Prescriber type was determined by IQVIA and clinical specialties for nurse practitioners and physician assistants was not available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study highlights a slowed, but continued, increase in gabapentin dispensing from retail pharmacies in the United States," Guy and colleagues stated. "As gabapentin dispensing continues to increase, particularly among older populations, prescribing physicians and advanced practitioners should be alert to the potential adverse effects of gabapentin."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Research suggests a surprising link between blood type and stroke risk, with people carrying one specific group A blood type facing a higher likelihood of stroke before age 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding, published in 2022, deepens our understanding of how our unique biological makeup can impact our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You've probably heard of the A, B, AB, and O groups, which refer to the various chemical markers, known as antigens, found on the surface of our red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-new-blood-group-and-its-the-worlds-rarest?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Scientists Identify New Blood Group, And It's The World's Rarest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even within these major &lt;a href="https://www.science.org.au/curious/people-medicine/understanding-different-blood-types"&gt;blood types&lt;/a&gt;, there are subtle variations caused by mutations in the genes involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_140271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140271" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642.jpg" alt="Diagram of ABO blood groups and the IgM antibodies present in each." class="size-full wp-image-140271" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642-600x386.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-140271" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blood type is partly determined by the ABO blood group antigens present on red blood cells.

All participants were between the ages of 18 and 59.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings revealed a clear relationship between the gene responsible for the A1 blood subgroup, and early-onset stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A genome-wide search revealed two locations strongly associated with an earlier risk of stroke. One coincided with the spot where genes for blood type sit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second analysis of specific types of blood-type gene then found people whose genome coded for a variation of the A group had a 16 percent higher chance of a stroke before the age 60, compared with a population of other blood types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with a gene for group O1, the risk was lower by 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted, however, that the additional risk of stroke in people with type A blood is small, so there is no need for extra vigilance or screening in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still don't know why blood type A would confer a higher risk," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/963353"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; senior author and vascular neurologist Steven Kittner from the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it likely has something to do with blood-clotting factors like platelets and cells that line the blood vessels as well as other circulating proteins, all of which play a role in the development of blood clots."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study findings may seem alarming – that blood type could change early stroke risk – let's put these results into context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year in the US just under 800,000 individuals experience a stroke. Most of these events – around &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6535078/"&gt;three out of every four&lt;/a&gt; – occur in people 65 years and older, with risks doubling every decade after the age of 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the people included in the study lived in North America, Europe, Japan, Pakistan, and Australia, with people of non-European ancestry only making up 35 percent of participants. Future studies with a more diverse sample could help clarify the significance of the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We clearly need more follow-up studies to clarify the mechanisms of increased stroke risk," Kittner &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/963353"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key finding of the study came from comparing people who had a stroke before the age of 60 to those that had a stroke after the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this, the researchers used a dataset of about 9,300 people over the age of 60 who had a stroke, and some 25,000 controls over the age of 60 who didn't have a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the increased risk of stroke in the type A blood group became insignificant in the late-onset stroke group, suggesting that strokes that happen early in life may have a different mechanism compared to those that occur later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strokes in younger people are less likely to be caused by a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries (a process called atherosclerosis) and more likely to be caused by factors to do with clot formation, the authors &lt;a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/99/16/e1738"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that people with type B blood were around 11 percent more likely to have a stroke compared to non-stroke controls regardless of their age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.784"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the part of the genome that codes for blood type, called the 'ABO locus', is associated with coronary artery calcification, which restricts blood flow, and heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic sequence for A and B blood types have also been associated with a slightly higher risk of blood clots in veins, called venous thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/early/2022/08/31/WNL.0000000000201006"&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in September 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"This is a rare occurrence, and also a great example of how public health keeps a close eye on disease spread to assess risk and inform the community when needed," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Miller reassured the public that the risk remains low and advised individuals with symptoms to consult their healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare providers are encouraged to consider mpox in patients presenting with a rash consistent with the virus and to evaluate their travel history. All mpox cases should be reported to the Health Department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wastewater testing is being used alongside traditional clinical reporting to detect the presence of clade I mpox early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/who-renames-monkeypox-as-mpox-due-to-racism-concerns-world-health-organization-outbreak-vaccines-global-emergency#" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/who-renames-monkeypox-as-mpox-due-to-racism-concerns-world-health-organization-outbreak-vaccines-global-emergency#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;WHO renames monkeypox as mpox due to racism concerns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mpox virus spreads through close physical contact, including sexual contact and household interactions, and can be prevented using the same methods for both clade I and clade II.

A new line of clinical evidence says that is a mistake. Oral health, including both teeth and gums, could also be important for heart health by preventing arterial thickening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rigorous study in adults with severe gum disease found that thorough gum treatment slowed the thickening of neck arteries over two years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That change tracks with better &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-you-position-your-arm-can-alter-blood-pressure-readings-according-to-scientists/"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; vessel performance and calmer inflammation in the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clean-gums-healthy-heart"&gt;Clean gums, healthy heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A randomized clinical trial in London enrolled 135 otherwise healthy adults with severe &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK541126/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;periodontitis&lt;/a&gt;, a chronic infection of the tissues that support the teeth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants received either intensive periodontal treatment or a more routine cleaning; then they were monitored for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marco Orlandi of University College London (&lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;) led the work with a team of periodontists and cardiologists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their goal was to see whether aggressive gum care changes arteries that matter for heart and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intensive group received deep cleaning below the gumline, full mouth scaling, and corrective therapy as needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comparison group received a standard scale and polish that did not include deep cleaning of the gums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used ultrasound to measure carotid intima-media thickness (&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.116.005313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CIMT&lt;/a&gt;), which reflects artery wall thickening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also assessed &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/flow-mediated-dilatation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;flow-mediated dilation&lt;/a&gt; in the arm and collected blood to track inflammatory and oxidative stress markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-arteries-in-your-neck-matter"&gt;Why the arteries in your neck matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carotid arteries deliver blood to the brain, and their inner lining can thicken gradually as plaque builds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7115957/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 119 randomized trials showed that slowing the yearly increase in carotid thickness by about 0.01 millimeters was associated with roughly a 9 percent lower risk of future cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carotid thickness is not a disease by itself. It is a structural sign that helps researchers and clinicians watch how arteries change over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching both structure and function together paints a clearer picture. That is why the team paired ultrasound with tests of blood vessel function and analysis of blood biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small shifts in these measures may look modest on paper. Yet those shifts can accumulate across years, which is significant when the stakes are the heart and brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gums-talk-to-the-heart"&gt;Gums talk to the heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mouth full of deep pockets and plaque is more than a dental problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria and toxins slip into tiny blood vessels, the immune system ramps up, and that signal can ripple through the body and nudge &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/atherosclerosis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt; forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inner lining of blood vessels, the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK57145/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;endothelium&lt;/a&gt;, acts like a gatekeeper and helps arteries relax when blood flow increases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A non-invasive &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2878744/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt; measures the endothelium’s function by tracking how much an artery widens after a brief squeeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic gum infection can tilt that balance toward stiffness. Lowering the inflammatory burden in the mouth is one way to ease that pressure on vessel function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mechanism sits outside the classic cholesterol pathway, meaning the benefits occur without relying on the traditional risk routes that are usually linked to cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-oral-treatment-and-arterial-health"&gt;Oral treatment and arterial health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two years, the average inner lining of the carotid arteries was thinner in the intensive treatment group by about 0.02 millimeters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That suggests slower structural aging of those arteries in people whose gums were deep-cleaned when compared with those who received a routine scrape and polish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood vessel function improved early after treatment and stayed better through the study period. The change was seen within two months and persisted at repeated checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-blood-pressure-drug-rilmenidine-slows-aging-extends-lifespan-in-older-animals/"&gt;Blood&lt;/a&gt; tests pointed in the same direction. People who received intensive care had lower levels of inflammatory proteins and fewer oxidative stress markers in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was very overwhelmed when I looked at the data the first time,” said Dr. Orlandi, expressing his surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caveats-and-cautions"&gt;Caveats and cautions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was done at a single center with participants who were healthy apart from gum disease. Results need to be tested in different locations and in people with more complex medical histories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial tracked &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cause-of-strokes-cervical-artery-dissection-has-increased-400-percent-since-2005/"&gt;arteries&lt;/a&gt; and biomarkers, not heart attacks or strokes. It cannot prove that periodontal therapy will directly cut those events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medications and lifestyle still matter when it comes to cardiovascular prevention. We should view gum care as a partner to, not a replacement for, standard heart risk management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies should ask whether periodontal therapy layered onto usual prevention changes hard outcomes. That is the next step to turn this signal into clinical guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-teeth-gums-hearts-and-arteries"&gt;Teeth, gums, hearts, and arteries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gum disease is common, affecting about 4 out of every 10 U.S. adults aged 30 and older, according to a CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oral-health/about/gum-periodontal-disease.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. Many people do not notice early signs because bleeding gums and bad breath can be easy to shrug off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentists treat advanced disease with deep cleaning, root planing, and structured maintenance visits. The study used these same tools in a deliberate, stepwise way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brushing twice daily, cleaning between teeth, and regular exams reduce plaque and inflammation. When periodontitis is present, your clinician may recommend a staged plan that includes deep cleaning below the gumline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you track blood pressure, cholesterol, and tobacco exposure, add oral health to that list. The mouth and body are one system, so protecting both is a smart move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf555/8237946" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 21:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNNno1a1kzWTFRWmtnYzhwa2YxTXJrUjJ4YU9WTmVmNW85R1RsZ3RDVENuUXp2Ul9mN1c5S25idEtoSEg3WDFfbi14b1NnRjdnRGwtblFROFNFaTNCSkpma0VERExFZFFScHZjdnhmY3BqbHg3N2UyTm5xa2dDa1FWTDJLZ0REbHVIMU56MjVRZzFUTjZaNWdpZzNWNA</guid></item><item><title>费城陪审团对家庭护理机构对阿尔茨海默病患者的死亡作出了1400万$的判决- Inquirer.com</title><link>https://www.inquirer.com/health/bayada-home-care-verdict-fall-wrongful-death-20250929.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article-body-light "&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Diana Dawson, a 74-year-old suffering from Alzheimer‚Äôs, fell off her&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;bed while under the care of a health aide at her Southwest Philadelphia home on the morning of Feb. 16, 2021.

This formulation, which targets the lungs directly, "has a strong rationale as a treatment for severe respiratory infections, including COVID-19, due to its antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-coagulant properties, which may prevent viral entry, lung injury progression, and pulmonary thrombosis," the study authors wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Previous preclinical and clinical studies of inhaled nebulised UFH in lung injury, have shown a positive effect on pulmonary coagulation, inflammation, oxygenation and other lung injury parameters," they added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible application in other respiratory diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In-hospital death among nebulized-UFH recipients was 4.3%, compared with 14.3% in controls (odds ratio [OR], 0.26), and the hazard ratio for 28-day mortality was significantly lower in the UFH group, at 0.36. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There was no heterogeneity in treatment effect between studies, suggesting that the overall effect was consistent between studies, and no difference was observed in treatment effect between patients given supplementary oxygen at baseline and those who weren't. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An analysis using a two-stage individual patient data meta-analysis combining aggregate data confirmed significant differences between the groups in terms of intubation or death (risk ratio [RR], 0.53) or in-hospital death (RR, 0.32). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Sometimes it's warmer weather that draws them in, while a particularly damp and rainy week in fall can also attract them. While they aren't dangerous, they're still a nuisance, and they will swarm anything sweet or damp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;To better understand what causes fruit fly infestations and how to stop them, we spoke with Jody Green, an entomologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. She broke down the main reasons they invade homes and the best ways to prevent them from sticking around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, you'll find her expert advice on how to block fruit flies before they take hold and the simple steps you can use to get rid of them if they've already moved in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=cnet.com" target="_self"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Add CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; as a preferred Google source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What's the cause of fruit fly infestations?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ripe produce and sugary foods are magnets for fruit flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Helin Loik-Tomson/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The common name that entomologists give fruit flies is "vinegar flies." That's because they're naturally attracted to fermented liquid, and when fruit rots, it also ferments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But fruit flies don't thrive only on rotten fruit or vinegar. They also love sugary substances like soda, wine and beer, and you can find them at the bottom of your trash bin or any wet place with a substantial food source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Substantial food source" may mean something different to you than to the small but mighty fruit fly, Green said. "It may not be the food you are wanting to eat, but fruit flies are so tiny it only takes a tiny microhabitat" -- like the residual soda in a can in your recycling bin or leftover bits and crumbs in a takeout container in your garbage, Green explained. Those are prime spots for fruit flies to breed. Once the weather warms, it takes less time for fruit fly eggs to turn into babies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/best-house-plants-to-deter-bugs/" target="_self"&gt;Keep Bugs Out of Your Kitchen With These Common Houseplants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to prevent fruit fly infestation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the garbage out as often as possible during warmer months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Taylor Martin/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleaning is the key to preventing fruit flies from taking over your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/its-probably-time-for-you-to-replace-these-8-kitchen-tools/" target="_self"&gt;kitchen&lt;/a&gt;. Keeping your place as dry and free of food as possible prevents pests from continuing their life cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throw away garbage and take out recycling frequently. Clean out the bottom of bins when liquid accumulates, wipe down counters after you're finished cooking, and keep your sink and garbage disposal free of old food, empty of dishes and as dry as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/mill-kitchen-bin-review/" target="_self"&gt;This Magic Kitchen Bin Turns Chicken Bones and Food Scraps Into Dirt Overnight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storing fruits and vegetables in the fridge instead of on the counter will also make it harder for the fruit flies to find them. And since they're attracted to rotting fruit, you should carefully pick your produce at the store to make sure you aren't bringing any rotten or bruised pieces home, Green said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's especially important to store foods that ferment quickly. Fruit flies thrive on the rot produced by cabbages, strawberries, bananas and other fruits and vegetables that can often break down before you notice them aging out of edibility. Sugary substances should also be stowed away, cups should be lidded or washed out and trash bags should be regularly switched out to prevent fruit fly infestations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also added that you should &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/i-cut-my-kitchen-waste-by-80-with-this-one-appliance/" target="_self"&gt;recycle or compost &lt;/a&gt;cardboard boxes that hold produce as soon as possible because fruit flies could be breeding in them. Any place that catches water or is moist, like a wet kitchen rag or the rug beside the sink, could become a breeding ground for fruit flies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Try vinegar and dish soap to slow down an infestation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;BackyardProduction / Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from consulting our experts, we also did some digging on the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/179elgx/how_in_the_world_do_you_get_rid_of_fruit_flies/?rdt=39737" target="_self"&gt;r/CleaningTips subreddit&lt;/a&gt; to see what other people experience. Some users found their issue wasn't fruit flies but fungus gnats. It's worth confirming the infestation by identifying the insect. Many users also noted that an &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/benefits-apple-cider-vinegar-health/" target="_self"&gt;ACV&lt;/a&gt; and dish soap trap caught a lot of the flies and helped fight their infestations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make a vinegar and soap fruit fly trap, put a few ounces of apple cider vinegar mixed with a few drops of dish soap in a small dish and cover with plastic wrap.

This can be transmitted to people if they eat food touched by fruit flies. The best way to stay safe is to throw out food touched by the flies to dispose of any potential bacteria. If you feel you've eaten fruit that may have been affected by a fruit fly, you should reach out to your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 19:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxPWTZqdlN5VWNzS3p4TTBSdlh5bkFZMDE2U1Z2LVlmWGtVRXRWaEFPVkZpLXZxaE1hOC1fME4zQ2Q0c2NTYU9SelBhdzhNWUhJRVBodXhhdVNxWGo4Zk5Oek5QeUNEZjZhRDFYMGxldHgxbHNDT1Q2U3J5dzdrU0xCWUpVcGpfRi1FbklSTDdtWk54V014c2hPVlBwUTFLUEg5N3N2b2lka3Qxcm9QZDBrZ1VDZU1objN3Tm1vQ1BkYnlybk51VXBQakdRVQ</guid></item><item><title>由营养师制定的7天高纤维地中海饮食计划，帮助降低胆固醇- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-high-fiber-mediterranean-diet-meal-plan-lower-cholesterol-11820866</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-table__table-wrapper"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18015/health-condition/low-cholesterol/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;recipes for healthy cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 343 to 478 calories while the lunches span 373 to 595 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a 1,200 calorie modification?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_190-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean diet centers around lean proteins like beans, nuts and fish that are low in saturated fat—the kind of fat that can raise LDL cholesterol if consumed in excess.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s also rich in plant foods like fruits, veggies, legumes and whole grains that are naturally high in antioxidants and fiber—nutrients that help prevent your digestive tract from absorbing cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_191-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_192-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The best part is that the Mediterranean Diet is quite easy to follow since it isn’t overly restrictive, making it one of the most popular and sustainable diets out there. Nothing is fully off limits on this diet, but saturated fats, added sugars and refined grains are consumed in moderation for further heart health benefits.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For over two decades, finasteride—a popular prescription drug taken by millions of men to treat hair loss—has quietly carried a shadow. Behind its cosmetic promise lay disturbing signs of deeper harm: depression, anxiety, and in some cases, suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Now, a new review by Prof. Mayer Brezis of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/analytical-review-depression-suicidality-finasteride/" target="_blank"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; the medical and regulatory community failed the public—not once, but repeatedly—by overlooking mounting evidence of finasteride's potentially devastating psychiatric effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review, published in the &lt;i&gt;The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;, compiles data from eight major studies conducted between 2017 and 2023, showing a consistent signal: users of finasteride were significantly more likely to experience mood disorders and suicidal thoughts than comparable patients not taking the drug. The findings span multiple countries and data systems, from the U.S. FDA's adverse event reports to national health records in Sweden, Canada, and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The evidence is no longer anecdotal," said Prof. Brezis, a professor emeritus of medicine and public health. "We now see consistent patterns across diverse populations. And the consequences may have been tragic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the paper, hundreds of thousands of people may have suffered from depression related to finasteride use, and hundreds—possibly more—may have died by suicide. The drug, originally approved in 1997 by the FDA to treat male pattern baldness, has remained a staple in the dermatological toolbox, often marketed directly to young men as a low-risk, high-reward solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But beneath the surface, critics argue, warning signs were ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;A delayed response, with a high cost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the FDA acknowledged depression as a potential side effect in 2011 and added suicidality in 2022, researchers had raised alarms as early as 2002. Internal FDA documents from 2010, cited in Brezis' paper, reveal whole paragraphs blacked out as "confidential"—including estimates of how many users could have been affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2011, the FDA had recorded just 18 suicides linked to finasteride. But based on global usage estimates, that number should have ranged in the thousands. "It wasn't just underreporting," Dr. Brezis wrote. "It was a systemic failure of pharmacovigilance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike weight-loss drugs or psychiatric medications that receive intense post-marketing scrutiny, finasteride's cosmetic status may have helped it avoid deeper investigation. Notably, none of the data-mining studies cited in Brezis' review were conducted by Merck, the original manufacturer, or requested by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A cosmetic drug with life-altering risks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brezis argues the drug's classification as a non-essential, appearance-enhancing medication changes the risk calculus. "This wasn't about life or death medical necessity," he said. "This was about hair."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biological rationale is clear. Finasteride works by blocking the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), but in doing so, it may also disrupt neurosteroids like allopregnanolone—linked to mood regulation in the brain. Animal studies have shown long-term effects on neuroinflammation and even changes in hippocampal structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some patients, the consequences don't end when the pills do. Reports of lingering symptoms—dubbed "post-finasteride syndrome"—include insomnia, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/panic+attacks/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;panic attacks&lt;/a&gt;, cognitive dysfunction, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/suicidal+thoughts/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;suicidal thoughts&lt;/a&gt; that persist months or even years after stopping treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Regulatory gaps, corporate silence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report is especially scathing toward the FDA and Merck. Despite having access to millions of patient records and robust pharmacovigilance tools, neither party acted in time, Brezis argues. The industry's silence was strategic, he suggests, driven by market pressures and legal liability—echoing past controversies like Merck's handling of Vioxx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nothing is more important to Organon than the safety of our medicines," the company recently claimed in a public statement. Yet none of the safety studies cited were initiated by the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA, meanwhile, took five years to respond to a citizen petition calling for a black-box warning. Its final decision? To add suicidal ideation to the label—but not as a formal warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brezis is calling for immediate changes in how drugs like finasteride are approved, monitored, and prescribed. His recommendations include suspending marketing of the drug for cosmetic purposes until safety is re-established, mandatory post-approval studies with strict enforcement, and systematic recording of drug histories in suicide investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many, those changes come too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is dedicated to one such individual—a previously healthy man who took finasteride "just" to improve his hair. Within days, he spiraled into severe psychiatric distress. He never recovered. Months later, he took his own life.&lt;/p&gt;
