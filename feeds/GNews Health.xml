The Russians retreated but burned the countryside as they withdrew, using scorched-earth tactics that eventually left Napoleon’s troops occupying a ruined Moscow. By fall, his ill-fated troops began to leave for encampments along the Russian border, where an estimated 300,000 of them were eventually mowed down not by military might, but by illness coupled with extreme cold, starvation and exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 18:19:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNZ2dZVnpoWFFRdjg5QTZQRFdKREhfelRUU3ZpNHp0dFZoaW1Rb2NuaFFWRzBiMWdjZnV5dkZGZ041Yk9RV3hmcjE5QWpDeG10Y3ZqVnhfYVY2R2RJako4eVNvdkplSkk2UVZudG94OGtWQVNjVF9BY1BVRko1ckJIYk90UTI0WjR3Y25hS0VWb1B6VDRFQUhB</guid></item><item><title>UTI可能来自您的购物车- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/utis-might-be-coming-from-your-grocery-cart-2000676662</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here’s something to unnerve you during your next trip to the supermarket. Research out this week shows that a substantial portion of urinary tract infections can be traced back to store-bought meat tainted with dangerous &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at George Washington University and others examined thousands of samples taken from people with UTIs. They found that roughly one in five infections were likely caused by foodborne strains of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. The results suggest that contaminated meat is an underappreciated source of these often miserable infections, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These findings highlight zoonotic transmission as an important driver of UTIs,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01428-25"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the journal mBio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The origins of a UTI&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;UTIs are one of the most common infections around, and they’re &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/230/5/e1101/7701247"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to result in 3 million visits to the emergency room in the U.S. alone every year. Over 80% of UTIs are &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/report/urinary-tract-infection#:~:text=Bacteria%20that%20cause%20UTIs%20include,found%20in%20feces%20(stool)."&gt;caused&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. These bacteria are found most everywhere, including the guts of people and many of the animals that we regularly eat, though only some strains can make us sick.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The George Washington University researchers have been investigating the possibility of foodborne UTIs for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2018, for instance, they &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/store-bought-chicken-could-be-causing-urinary-tract-inf-1828652990"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a study showing clear evidence of human UTIs caused by &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; bacteria first found in store-bought meat, especially chicken. But the researchers say it’s still been unclear just how often UTIs are likely to originate from food, particularly in major metropolitan areas. To help answer this, they teamed up with other researchers at Kaiser Permanente Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Together, they collected a large amount of &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;samples from both real-life UTI patients in Southern California and packages of retail meat, ultimately sequencing the genetics of over 5,000 samples. They then developed an algorithm, based on 17 specific genetic markers, to identify whether a particular sample of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; originally came from animals or humans.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All told, they found that 18% of human UTI infections diagnosed in the region between 2017 and 2023 were probably zoonotic in origin—foodborne, in other words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hidden meat risk&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers note that their findings are limited to a single, if large, region. So more studies should be done to quantify the extent of this issue in other parts of the country. But given their earlier research, it certainly seems likely that tainted meat plays a significant and underrecognized role in UTIs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Urinary tract infections have long been considered a personal health issue, but our findings suggest that they are also a food safety problem,” said senior study author Lance Price, a professor of environmental and occupational health at George Washington University, in a &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/nearly-1-5-urinary-tract-infections-linked-contaminated-meat"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The current findings might also help inform prevention efforts moving forward. The most dangerous foodborne UTI strains tended to come from chicken and turkey, for instance. And people living in low-income neighborhoods were more likely to have foodborne UTIs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the same tips used to prevent foodborne illness in general should also lower your risk of these UTIs. That includes buying meat that’s securely sealed and won’t leak onto your other groceries, thoroughly cooking your meat, and washing your hands after handling raw food.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

But things have changed, and the “talk” I’d always planned isn’t going to cut it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

I was prepared to answer awkward questions, provide condoms and buy Plan B like a good parent, because abstinence-only sex ed is how you end up with teen pregnancy and STDs. But I wasn’t prepared to need to cover burner phones, passports, and abortion bounty hunters! “It’s important to practice safe sex, but if you think you might be pregnant, don’t Google, pay cash for your pregnancy test, and certainly don’t tell your boyfriend because if you decide to go to Mexico to terminate, Border Patrol can search your phone and jail you and your boyfriend can turn you in for a $10,000 reward.” I’d like to think my girls are smart enough to conclude on their own that safe sex isn’t all that safe anymore, but hormones and developing brains don’t always make the best decisions. Do you have any tips for navigating this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="307" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh52nhyr000d3b7791rf3ile@published"&gt;Tell your daughters the truth, frightening as it may be. If you live in a place where abortion is illegal or severely restricted, then yes, make sure they know not to text about an unwanted pregnancy or to Google ways to terminate; you should also tell them to make sure they can fully trust their partner not to report them before sharing the news. Do your own research on where the nearest state is that provides abortions and how to go about securing care if the need arises. Make sure that your daughters know that sex always carries a risk, but that it is heightened where they live and encourage them to consider that when deciding what to do and where to go after high school. Make condoms available to them and tell them that if they wish to be sexually active, you’ll take them to get on birth control (if, hopefully, it remains available.) Acknowledge that talking to your mother about sex can be absolutely cringe-inducing, but that it would be better to endure some awkward chats than to find themselves in a difficult situation that could be avoided. Encourage them to wait until they are absolutely sure that they are ready to have sex and to only do so with a person who they can trust. Talk to them candidly about how boys often use girls for sex, or go tell others that they’ve been intimate with them. Tell them about the double standards for girls and boys and that while they shouldn’t determine what they choose to do, they may be penalized for simply honoring their desires. Make sure they are aware of what the major sexually transmitted infections are and how to obtain treatment. These are scary times indeed, but the more you share with your girls, the better prepared they will be.&lt;/p&gt;

However, I just can’t seem to come up with an appropriate response to: “What is sex?” She has asked twice now. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2017/10/dear-prudence-talking-to-your-child-about-sex.html"&gt;I freeze up and tell her we’ll talk about it when I have time to explain it properly.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Viruses are tiny — and sneaky.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So sneaky that some play a deadly game of hide and seek. The "seek" part is all too familiar: They're always looking for ways to infect humans. Their ability to hide is far less well-known and can have devastating implications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The human body holds several effective hiding spots that some of the world's nastiest viruses have discovered — like the eyes and the testes — that are beyond the reach of the immune system. It's here that submicroscopic viral RNA can safely linger.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Often the human hosts have no idea. They'd fallen ill, then appeared to beat the virus. Their blood tested negative. They show no symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But that hidden virus is capable of springing back into action. It can emerge from hiding — either sickening the original host or slipping into semen or breast milk and infecting someone new.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Which viruses have mastered this technique? A number of notorious ones from Zika to measles to highly deadly viruses like Nipah, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/10/06/g-s1-91435/virus-marburg-deadly-disease-rwanda" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Marburg&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Lassa fever.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the virus that terrified the world in 2014: Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the decade since, the Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced more than its fair share of Ebola crises — with nine outbreaks, including one that is ongoing — and more than its fair share of hidden viruses that spring back into action.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Almost all the outbreaks recently — maybe not every single one of them but the vast majority — are traced back to a previous outbreak," says Dr. Elizabeth Higgs, who is with the Division of Clinical Research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. She says once the genetics of the virus are sequenced it is clear that many of the outbreaks haven't come from an animal — like a bat — but from a human who unwittingly carried the virus after surviving a previous outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While most survivors will never start a new outbreak, it is happening enough that Higgs says, "I think it's top of the research agenda."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Everybody was panicking"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Soka Moses first grasped the significance of these virus hideouts a decade ago. It was in mid-March 2015 when people in his West African country of Liberia were heaving a collective sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The country was emerging from a nightmare, recalls Moses, then the medical director at an Ebola treatment center. Nearly 5,000 people died over the previous year. Some perished in the streets, unable to find a hospital bed. Schools shuttered, markets closed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Finally, in early March of 2015, there were no more Ebola cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the crisis was not over.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Shortly after Liberia had reached zero cases, Moses recalls sitting in a daily meeting led by Liberia's National Epidemic Response Team when "boom! A case was identified." As word got out, he says: "Everybody was panicking: 'Oh, my God. Are we starting this again?'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Part of the panic was the mystery. How could this woman have contracted Ebola when there were no active cases? The virus spreads easily when someone comes into contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, even sweat or saliva, but it was not clear where or how this new patient could have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Family members eventually pointed medical investigators to the woman's sexual partner. Five months ago he'd recovered from Ebola. "[He'd] tested negative on two different occasions," says Moses. "[He was] doing perfectly fine, no symptoms whatsoever."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The man was terrified and, initially, avoided the authorities. "He thought he was in really big trouble," says Moses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once he was reassured that he was not in trouble, he agreed to cooperate. The challenge for scientists: Find out if the virus was hiding somewhere in his body.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They ultimately determined that the Ebola virus was no longer in his blood … but lived on in his testes and had been transmitted in his semen.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"So that was the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18584" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first documented sexually transmitted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; case of Ebola virus disease," says Moses. While he'd read about a 1967 case in which another virus hid out in the body, the implications were now much clearer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This prompted Moses to act. He's now the director of PREVAIL or the Partnership for Research on Vaccines &amp;amp; Infectious Diseases in Liberia, which studies the phenomenon of hidden viruses, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The body's sanctuary sites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers have identified a number of spots where the viruses can hide — not only eyes and testes but also the brain, the placenta and vaginal fluids as well as the mammary glands.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We call them sanctuary sites," says &lt;a href="https://www.usna.edu/NASEC/_files/documents/2023/CAPT_Joel_Montgomery.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Joel Montgomery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the Viral Special Pathogens Branch at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the virus, these are havens protected from the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists think this is likely because these body parts are critical for survival — and vulnerable to damage if the immune system overreacts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, "in the process of making eggs and sperm, we mix and match the genes. So they're not really us anymore," says &lt;a href="https://medicine.tulane.edu/departments/pediatrics-medicine-infectious-diseases-debakey-pediatrics-med-peds-tips-mentor/faculty" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. John Schieffelin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at Tulane University School of Medicine. That means the immune system might see eggs or sperm as foreign invaders and try to attack them, so it's helpful if those parts of the body are outside the reach of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The brain has a special level of protection&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the blood brain barrier which limits the entry of immune cells. As for the eye? "An eye doctor might scold me for this, but to me, it's really an extension of the brain. There's a large nerve that goes from your eye directly into your brain," Schieffelin says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many mysteries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's still a lot scientists don't know about how viruses behave in these sanctuary sites.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For example, exactly how long can a virus stay there? In many cases where individuals were tested, it appears to be a matter of months. In some cases, it's years. There have even been semen samples that test negative for the virus at one point then return to positive later. It's not clear to scientists what prompted this reversal. And researchers haven't followed enough people who've harbored one of these infections long enough to know the outer limit.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another big unknown: What is the virus doing in the sanctuary site? It seems as if it's almost dormant, barely replicating. "But we don't know why someone relapses. We don't know if it's a drop in their immune system or if there's some other factor," says Montgomery.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear and stigma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Montgomery says the goal is to identify medications for survivors that can reach into sanctuary sites and root out any hidden virus. For this, he says, the size of the molecule in the drug is key.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We really need to explore the use of small-molecule drugs," he says, suggesting the smaller the drug's molecule the more likely it can penetrate the protective barrier around a sanctuary site.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Moses' team has been studying exactly this with the drug remdesivir — and results have been promising. Survivors who got the drug cleared the virus from their semen more quickly than survivors who got the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While many of the researchers are focused on the biology, something that's never far from their mind is the psychological part of the equation. Ebola survivors can face intense fear and stigma.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When Dr. Dehkontee Dennis — who works at PREVAIL in Liberia — was enrolling for the study, she says she noticed "there was one thing that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these men have expressed: They have this fear. They don't want to transmit the virus to their families. They want to have children. They want to stop using condoms [to prevent transmission]."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The flip side of their fear is that many of the community members — who may have lost their partners and other family members to Ebola — fear the survivors may still pose a threat, even if they don't know about sanctuary sites. "Community members did not even want them back in the communities," says Moses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This level of stigma makes it tricky to talk about the risk that the virus could hide in a survivor and then resurface. Survivors and their community need to know there's a chance this could happen, the scientists say — but only in a small percentage of cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Reassurance can also come from survivor programs that test semen and vaccination campaigns to protect the community. But scientists say the solution will be finding medications that can ferret out these hidden, potentially lethal viruses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's great that we have vaccines," says Joel Montgomery of the CDC. "It's great that we have therapeutics. It's great that we're saving people's lives. But now we need to figure out a way to make sure the virus is completely eliminated from them."&lt;/p&gt;

No one was injured, and that alone is telling news. It is the first time that this “enteral ventilation” approach, based on a fish that breathes from its intestines, has been attempted on humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A strange behavior of serious beginnings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story starts with a kind of eel fish called a loach. When kept in filth, low-oxygen water, it does something strange—it swallows air and absorbs oxygen in the intestines. The strange trick caught the attention of Japanese researcher Takanori Takebe, MD, PhD, a biomedical scientist with appointments in Tokyo and at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when ventilators had been used up in hospitals worldwide, Takebe was left wondering whether humans ever learned from the loach’s example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Graphical abstract of the study. (CREDIT: ScienceDirect Med)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion might seem laughable, but it is science-driven. The active ingredient is odorless, colorless liquid perfluorodecalin—a perfluorocarbon that had previously been under investigation for “liquid breathing.” The liquid can hold several times more oxygen than water and has already been used safely in surgery and eye treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is simple but revolutionary: if the fluid is filled with oxygen and the gut can absorb gases, why not use the gut as an auxiliary respiratory organ in the event of lung failure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The first human test&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new trial translated that question from the lab to the clinic. The phase 1 study took place at a Japanese hospital, where it recruited young men who volunteered to inject small amounts of non-oxygenated perfluorodecalin into their rectum for an hour. Scientists were not testing whether it would save lives—but whether it was safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process was serious, not jesting. Fluid was added gradually through a soft catheter, and volunteers were monitored closely for signs of pain, shifts in vital signs, or chemical indication of the fluid in their systems. The purpose was simple: determine the amount of fluid man could hold safely and whether their bodies reacted negatively to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Takanori Takebe, MD, PhD, a biomedical scientist with appointments in Tokyo and at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. (CREDIT: Dr. Takanori Takebe)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were surprisingly peaceful. Every one except a few tolerated the process well. Some reported bloating or cramping with higher volumes, but pain disappeared once the fluid was released. No one had negative, severe side effects, and blood tests showed no liver, kidney, or blood chemistry damage. Most significantly, the fluid didn’t intrude into the circulatory system—it stayed right where it was supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early whispers of promise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without added oxygen, perfluorodecalin contains more dissolved oxygen than venous blood. In theory, a small amount could diffuse through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers did note weak signs that this was happening, but not enough to have a clinical effect yet. That’s not surprising—this was a safety study, not a rescue experiment. But it sets up the second trial, which will use fully oxygenated liquid to see if it can measurably boost oxygen in people with low blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Takebe, who himself won an Ig Nobel Prize once—a tongue-in-cheek prize for science that “first makes people laugh, then think”—this is no joke. “Enteric ventilation might be a life-saver as a back-up mode of oxygen delivery,” he said. “Our initial results suggest that it could save patients with severe respiratory failure when conventional ventilation fails.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;SpO2 profiles for the low-, medium-, or high-dosage group Changes in time series of the SpO2 values depending on the non-oxygenated perfluorodecalin dose for each group average. (CREDIT: ScienceDirect Med)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Behind the Humor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future tests confirm that oxygenated perfluorodecalin can boost blood oxygen, the procedure might revolutionize the treatment of respiratory distress for doctors. In an emergency, it might save precious minutes as doctors intubate a patient or prepare a ventilator. With fragile newborn lungs, it might be a more compassionate way to deliver oxygen without causing additional harm. And in global tragedies—when hospitals drain machines—there to serve as a low-tech salvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at EVA Therapeutics, founded by Takebe, are already planning the next round of trials in Japan. They will maximize how much liquid can be used, how long it should stay there, and how much oxygen might make its way into the blood. The hope is one day this strange-sounding solution might make a difference in quiet ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the humor is a vigorous warning: medical breakthroughs tend to begin with concepts that sound preposterous. After being dismissed as a curiosity, the breathing of the loach in its intestines now serves as the foundation for a potential new technique for maintaining human life. With ventilators in short supply and respiratory arrest still being fatal, even the most absurd concepts deserve a second review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Tolerability and adverse events from testing related to the study. (CREDIT: ScienceDirect Med)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Practical Implications of the Research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the trials prove out that oxygenated perfluorodecalin is safe to deliver oxygen through the intestine, hospitals may have a new tool in the respiratory crisis arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method could lower the risk of ventilator-induced damage, support delicate newborn lungs, and give life-saving aid when other machinery is unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also challenges scientists to re-conceive human physiology and teaches us that sometimes survival is more about imagination than medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research findings are available online in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666634025003149" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ScienceDirect Med;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ScienceDirect Med&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like these kind of feel good stories?

                Two-to-three thousand soldiers from Napoleon's army were found in a mass grave in the northern suburbs of Vilnius, Lithuania in 2001.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;By 1812, Napoleon was all powerful. Nearly all of Europe was under his control. He had succeeded in forbidding most of the continent from trading with Britain in an effort to bring the island nation to heel. And he was married to Marie Louise, daughter of the emperor of Austria, a major superpower at the time. (The dazzling emerald and diamond necklace that he gifted her when they were wed was one of the objects stolen in last weekend's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/19/nx-s1-5579509/thieves-steal-priceless-jewels-louvre" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;heist at the Louvre&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the Russian Empire had been resisting his efforts to cut off all trade with Britain. That summer, he ordered his army, some 600,000 strong, to invade Russia. It would prove to be a terrible decision.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This is one of the most infamous military campaigns in the last centuries," says &lt;a href="https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/microbial-paleogenomics/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nicolás Rascovan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the microbial paleogenomics unit at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. "He believed that he was going to be able to conquer the whole world, more or less. It was probably the beginning of the end."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In October, Napoleon called his soldiers back after barely engaging the Russian army. It wasn't a defeat, but it was no win either. And during the march home, winter arrived early.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They started to die of cold, hunger, and also infectious diseases," says Rascovan. All told, hundreds of thousands perished.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And in a new study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(25)01247-3" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Current Biology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Rascovan and his colleagues say those diseases likely include two unexpected pathogens that would have helped hasten the soldiers' demise.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-94828" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Combined with earlier work, it's become clear that these men were under microbial assault on all fronts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These wars were anything but glamorous," says &lt;a href="https://www.novetus.at/#kontakt" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Michaela Binder&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a bioarchaeologist with Novetus, an archaeology company based in Vienna, who wasn't involved in the study. "For some of them, the death in battle would have been a relief."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A rich and bloody history, reconstructed&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Typhus and trench fever have long been thought to be among the afflictions that Napoleon's soldiers suffered. This is based on a mix of historical accounts, the discovery of body lice on the remains of soldiers (which carried the pathogens that transmitted the ailments), and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/193/1/112/863741" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA analyses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; conducted nearly a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But molecular techniques have improved dramatically since then.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And so a pair of archaeologists asked Rascovan, who studies the DNA of ancient pathogens, to see what other afflictions he might be able to turn up in the remains of a mass grave in Lithuania. The site had been discovered accidentally during a construction project in one the northern suburbs of Vilnius in 2001. Two-to-three thousand of Napoleon's men had been buried there soon after they died.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Europe has such a rich history that we have archaeological sites pretty much everywhere," says Rascovan. "So you dig a hole in the ground and then you find something."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-94829" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Among the remains that the archaeologists had unearthed were 13 teeth, each from a different soldier. These teeth would have had blood flowing through their interiors long ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you have DNA of the pathogen in the blood because you have an infection, that DNA can get into the tooth," explains Rascovan. "So then it's kind of a time machine in which you can really see the blood of the individual back then."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Only after decontaminating the teeth, grinding them into a powder, and dissolving the bone dust could the ancient DNA be studied. But naturally, that genetic code was in rough shape. It consisted of super short fragments that had undergone chemical changes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rascovan sequenced all of it. Some of the genetic material came from the soldiers themselves. Some of it derived from organisms in the soil in which they were buried. And some of it — perhaps — was from pathogens that helped kill these men.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Once we have a huge list of all the different things that have been detected, we try to find which are the species that match a human pathogen," he says. "It's like doing a puzzle."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'A story of hardship'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After Rascovan and his team finished that puzzle, they had two hits. Both of them were bacteria: one that caused paratyphoid fever and the other relapsing fever, a pathogen transmitted by body lice that dated back to the Iron Age.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This paper shows clearly how complex these types of analyses are and the extreme level of skill required to work with these types of data," says &lt;a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/oeai/institute/team/person/leslie-quade" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Leslie Quade&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a paleopathologist at the Austrian Archaeological Institute who didn't participate in the research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She says that discerning the emergence, spread, and evolution of diseases in the past can also help us navigate the pathogens of today.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Understanding how certain types of pathogens developed can give us a better chance of anticipating what a pathogen's next step might be," says Quade. In addition, if a certain once-widespread pathogen has become rare today, these infection-laden historical events may offer lessons to learn to keep it from returning and to contain other similar modern pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These findings are another reminder that war has always been ugly, Binder says. "We have these paintings in the museums of soldiers in shiny armors, of Napoleon on his horse, fit young men marching into battle."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"But in the end, when we look at the human remains, we see an entirely different picture," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's a picture of lifelong malnutrition, broken feet from marching too far, too quickly, and bodies riddled with disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Their bones tell a story of hardship," says Binder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as we drift into what feels like unconscious rest, our brains might not be entirely asleep. According to the study &lt;em&gt;DREAM: The Dream EEG and Mentation Database&lt;/em&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, parts of the brain can remain alert during even the deepest stages of sleep — and dreaming may not be limited to REM sleep after all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This large-scale, international collaboration brings together decades of dream research into one unified, open-access platform. Coordinated by &lt;em&gt;Monash University&lt;/em&gt; in Australia, the DREAM project analyzed 2,643 awakenings from 505 volunteers, drawing data from 20 separate studies across 13 countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dreams Beyond REM: Sleep Is Less Silent Than It Seems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, REM sleep was viewed as the exclusive domain of dreaming — marked by vivid imagery, muscle paralysis, and rapid eye movements. But the data in DREAM challenge this assumption. Among the 2,643 awakenings, participants reported having dream experiences in about 85% of REM cases, but also in a surprising 40% to 60% of NREM (non-REM) awakenings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even during slow-wave sleep — the deepest and most restorative phase — some individuals described emotional thoughts or fragmented sensations. The researchers examined the final 30 seconds of brain activity before each awakening, using &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61945-1" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61945-1" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EEG and MEG technologies&lt;/a&gt; to capture electrical and magnetic patterns in the brain. What they found was surprising: in NREM dreams, brain waves began to show faster, smaller oscillations, mimicking the patterns of quiet wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, the brain — or at least &lt;em&gt;part of it&lt;/em&gt; — may temporarily enter an “awake-like” state, despite the body remaining deeply asleep. These episodes may reflect &lt;strong&gt;brief bursts of conscious processing&lt;/strong&gt;, supporting the idea that consciousness during sleep is more of a spectrum than a switch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Artificial Intelligence Learns to Read Dreams&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The strength of the &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/five-fingers-dream-of-mao-zedong/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="62726" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DREAM&lt;/a&gt; project lies not only in the scale of its data, but in its methodology. Each awakening in the study was classified into one of three categories:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; (a clear dream),&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;an &lt;em&gt;experience without recall&lt;/em&gt; (often called a &lt;strong&gt;white dream&lt;/strong&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;or &lt;em&gt;no experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This triage system allowed researchers to train artificial intelligence models to predict whether a person had been dreaming based on brain activity alone. Simpler brain-wave features gave moderate accuracy in detecting dreams during deep NREM sleep, while more complex models improved accuracy during REM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As reported by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/is-our-brain-ever-fully-asleep-it-may-stay-awake-even-as-we-dream-48184" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.discovermagazine.com/is-our-brain-ever-fully-asleep-it-may-stay-awake-even-as-we-dream-48184" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, this is one of the first large-scale efforts to develop non-invasive dream detection tools. With further refinement, such technology could be used to monitor consciousness during sleep — or even serve as an early marker for cognitive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, other research referenced in the article suggests that difficulty reaching REM sleep may signal an early warning sign for Alzheimer’s disease, hinting at a broader medical relevance for sleep-stage mapping and dream monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As co-author &lt;em&gt;Giulio Bernardi&lt;/em&gt; noted in a press release, &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The work presented in the article, coordinated by Monash University (Australia), resulted from the efforts of 53 authors from 37 institutions across 13 countries, and represents a decisive step in the scientific exploration of human consciousness by bringing together and making decades of dream research available in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The infection often remains asymptomatic, allowing the bacteria to persist for years, but it can lead to ulcers and, in severe cases, gastric cancer. High-risk populations include people in East Asia, Eastern Europe, South America, older adults, and those with certain dietary habits or family history. Early detection, lifestyle modifications, and targeted treatment can prevent infection-related cancer and reduce the global burden of stomach cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;H. pylori bacteria and their role in &lt;keyword id="20349122" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="stomach-cancer-risk" source="Orion"&gt;stomach cancer risk&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common bacterium, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), has been linked to a significant proportion of stomach cancer cases worldwide. According to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03793-6" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a study published in Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, nearly 76% of gastric cancers may be attributable to this bacterium. Researchers estimate that approximately 16 million people born between 2008 and 2017 could develop stomach cancer in their lifetime, with around 12 million of these cases directly linked to H. pylori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;H. pylori lives in the stomach lining and can silently persist for years without producing noticeable symptoms. While most people remain unaware of its presence, the bacterium can sometimes lead to peptic ulcers and, in severe cases, gastric cancer. Asia is projected to account for the majority of H. pylori-related cases, with nearly 8 million expected, while North and South America may see about 1.5 million cases combined. Understanding the role of H. pylori in stomach cancer is vital because it identifies a largely preventable risk factor. Unlike cancers caused by genetics or lifestyle alone, early detection and treatment of H. pylori infection can dramatically reduce future gastric cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is most at risk of H. pylori infection and gastric cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain populations are more vulnerable to H. pylori-related stomach cancer. People living in high-prevalence regions, particularly East Asia, Eastern Europe, and parts of South America, face a higher lifetime risk. First-generation immigrants from these regions may also carry the bacteria if they were infected during childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other risk factors include a family history of stomach cancer, older age, smoking, obesity, and diets high in salted, smoked, or processed foods. Adults over 60 are especially susceptible, and some genetic predispositions can further increase vulnerability. High-risk individuals should remain vigilant and consider screening for H. pylori if symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Signs and &lt;keyword id="29822654" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="symptoms-of-H-pylori" source="Orion"&gt;symptoms of H. pylori&lt;/keyword&gt; infection to watch for&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;H. pylori often develops in childhood and remains dormant for years. Although many carriers never experience symptoms, about 30% develop complications such as ulcers or gastritis. Common warning signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Burning stomach pain or discomfort&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling full quickly after meals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea or frequent burping&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unexplained weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Indigestion and bloating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the bacteria can go undetected for years, persistent digestive discomfort should never be ignored. Timely medical evaluation can prevent serious complications and lower the risk of gastric cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention and lifestyle changes to lower stomach cancer risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although H. pylori is a major risk factor, lifestyle and preventive measures can significantly reduce the likelihood of developing stomach cancer. Key steps include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular physical activity to support overall health&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding or quitting smoking, which compounds gastric cancer risk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limiting alcohol consumption&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeking a timely medical evaluation for persistent digestive symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community awareness is also crucial. Educating families about the bacteria, safe hygiene practices, and risk factors can reduce transmission and promote early detection, particularly in high-prevalence regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Screening, diagnosis, and treatment options for H. pylori&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening for H. pylori infection can be done using breath tests, stool tests, or blood antibody tests, while in some cases, an endoscopy may be recommended to examine the stomach lining more closely. If the bacteria are detected, treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors to eradicate the infection and allow the stomach lining to heal. Although routine screening is not advised for populations in countries with low stomach cancer rates, high-risk individuals, including those with a family history, older adults, or people from regions with high prevalence, should undergo testing. Family members may also require evaluation, as the infection can spread within households. Early detection and timely treatment can prevent ulcers, reduce gastric cancer risk, and address a largely preventable cause of this disease.

A &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6770596/"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; titled 'Sodium Intake and Hypertension' found on PubMed Central reads, "A reduction in salt intake can have a favourable effect on the cardiovascular system, inducing a reduction in BP values in hypertensive patients, but also with possible benefits in the vascular function and in the viscoelastic properties of the large arteries."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, avoid adding salt in cooking or reduce it from your diet as much as possible. Also, read food labels to identify hidden sodium (which is generally found in processed foods, sauces, canned meals) and avoid such foods. The goal is to reduce the “extra” salt you add, because even small reductions, like 1 teaspoon per day, can impact your BP, according to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/shaking-the-salt-habit-to-lower-high-blood-pressure"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 11:46:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>这种饮料可以修复你的肝脏，平衡荷尔蒙，甚至对抗癌症-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/this-one-drink-could-fix-your-liver-balance-hormones-and-even-fight-cancer/articleshow/124765863.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they might be extremely difficult and tiring to peel, and this may be the reason you've been avoiding adding them to your grocery list, pomegranates are one of the healthiest fruits out there. Pomegranate juice is rich in antioxidants such as polyphenols including punicalagins and anthocyanins, vitamins such as Vitamin C and Vitamin K, minerals like potassium and iron and dietary fiber. Along with this, drinking the juice has numerous health benefits that we have listed below!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Supports liver health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

			&lt;p&gt;Social media and lifestyle magazines have turned gluten – a protein in wheat, rye, and barley – into a dietary villain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/news/novak-djokovic-gluten-free-diet"&gt;Athletes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/food/pictures/celebrities-who-follow-gluten-free-diets/"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt; have promoted gluten-free eating as the secret to better health and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But our &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01533-8/abstract"&gt;review in&lt;em&gt; The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published today, challenges that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gluten-intolerance-vs-celiac-disease-experts-reveal-the-key-differences"&gt;Gluten Intolerance vs Celiac Disease: Experts Reveal The Key Differences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By examining decades of research, we found that for most people who think they react to gluten, gluten itself is rarely the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms but not coeliac&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coeliac disease is when the body's immune system attacks itself when someone eats gluten, leading to inflammation and damage to the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But people with gut or other symptoms after eating foods containing gluten can test negative for coeliac disease or wheat allergy. They are said to have non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to understand whether gluten itself, or other factors, truly cause their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What we did and what we found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study combined more than 58 studies covering symptom changes and possible ways they could arise. These included studying the immune system, gut barrier, microbes in the gut, and psychological explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across studies, gluten-specific reactions were uncommon and, when they occurred, changes in symptoms were usually small. Many participants who believed they were "gluten sensitive" reacted equally – or more strongly – to a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="178903" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2013.04.051"&gt;One landmark trial&lt;/a&gt; looked at the role of fermentable carbohydrates (known as FODMAPs) in people who said they were sensitive to gluten (but didn't have coeliac disease). When people ate &lt;a href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/high-and-low-fodmap-foods/"&gt;a low-FODMAP diet&lt;/a&gt; – avoiding foods such as certain fruits, vegetables, legumes, and cereals – their symptoms improved, even when gluten was reintroduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2017.10.040"&gt;Another showed&lt;/a&gt; fructans – a type of FODMAP in wheat, onion, garlic, and other foods – caused more bloating and discomfort than gluten itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178919" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178919" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/onion_garlic_642.jpg" alt="onions and garlic" class="wp-image-178919 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/onion_garlic_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/onion_garlic_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178919" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A fermentable carbohydrate in onions and garlic caused more problems than gluten. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADerC2KW0s/"&gt;margouillatphotos /Getty Images Pro/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests most people who feel unwell after eating gluten are sensitive to something else. This could be FODMAPs such as fructans or other wheat proteins. Another explanation could be that symptoms reflect a disorder in how the gut interacts with the brain, similar to irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people may be truly sensitive to gluten. However, current evidence suggests this is uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;People expected symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A consistent finding is how expecting to have symptoms profoundly shapes people's symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(23)00317-5"&gt;In blinded trials&lt;/a&gt;, when people unknowingly ate gluten or placebo, symptom differences &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(25)00090-1"&gt;almost vanished&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some who expected gluten to make them unwell developed identical discomfort when exposed to a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This nocebo effect – the negative counterpart of placebo – shows that belief and prior experience influence how the brain processes signals from the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118229"&gt;Brain-imaging research&lt;/a&gt; supports this, showing that expectation and emotion activate brain regions involved in pain and how we perceive threats. This can heighten sensitivity to normal gut sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are real physiological responses. What the evidence is telling us is that focusing attention on the gut, coupled with anxiety about symptoms or repeated negative experiences with food, has real effects. This can sensitise how the gut interacts with the brain (known as the gut–brain axis) so normal digestive sensations are felt as pain or urgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178924" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178924" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/brain_scan_expectation_642.jpg" alt="brain scans" class="wp-image-178924 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/brain_scan_expectation_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/brain_scan_expectation_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178924" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Brain scans show expectation can activate regions involving pain. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADnBGtNmtE/"&gt;LarisaBozhikova/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising this psychological contribution doesn't mean symptoms are imagined. When the brain predicts a meal may cause harm, gut sensory pathways amplify every cramp or sensation of discomfort, creating genuine distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps explain why people remain convinced gluten is to blame even when blinded studies show otherwise. Symptoms are real, but the mechanism is often driven by expectation rather than gluten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what else could explain why some people feel better after going gluten-free? Such a change in the diet also reduces &lt;a href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/high-and-low-fodmap-foods/"&gt;high-FODMAP foods&lt;/a&gt; and ultra-processed products, encourages mindful eating and offers a sense of control. All these can improve our well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People also tend to eat more naturally gluten-free, nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts, which may further support gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The cost of going gluten-free&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2017.06.037"&gt;approximately 1% of the population&lt;/a&gt; with coeliac disease, avoiding gluten for life is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for most who feel better gluten-free, gluten is unlikely to be the true problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a cost to going gluten-free unnecessarily. Gluten-free foods are, on average, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2024.02.051"&gt;139% more expensive&lt;/a&gt; than standard ones. They are also often lower in fibre and key nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding gluten long-term can also reduce diversity in your diet, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.03.017"&gt;alter your gut microbes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.14258"&gt;reinforce anxiety about eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is it worth getting tested?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike coeliac disease or a wheat allergy, non-coeliac gluten sensitivity has no biomarker – there's no blood test or tissue marker that can confirm it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis instead relies on excluding other conditions and structured dietary testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our review, we recommend clinicians:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rule out coeliac disease and wheat allergy first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimise the quality of someone's overall diet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trial a low-FODMAP diet if symptoms persist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only then, consider a four to six-week dietitian-supervised gluten-free trial, followed by a structured reintroduction of gluten-containing foods to see whether gluten truly causes symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach keeps restriction targeted and temporary, avoiding unnecessary long-term exclusion of gluten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If gluten doesn't explain someone's symptoms, combining dietary guidance with psychological support often works best. That's because expectation, stress, and emotion influence our symptoms. Cognitive-behavioural or exposure-based therapies can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2014.01.007"&gt;reduce food-related fear&lt;/a&gt; and help people safely reintroduce foods they once avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This integrated model moves beyond the simplistic "gluten is bad" narrative toward personalised, evidence-based gut–brain care.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267098/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

It is best to avoid processed foods, she advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/rates-dementia-lower-people-who-eat-specific-diet-research-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mediterranean or MIND-style diet&lt;/a&gt;, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, olive oil and whole grains, has been linked to a lower risk of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Mediterranean or MIND-style diet, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, olive oil and whole grains, has been linked to a lower risk of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Foods that contain antioxidants, such as purple, red and blue grapes; blueberries; red berries, like strawberries; green, leafy vegetables, like broccoli, kale and spinach; and sweet potatoes, acorn or butternut squash are recommended," Picone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee and tea drinkers have a lower risk of Parkinson's disease, the doctor noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No. 3: Limit exposure to toxins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure to certain &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/planet-earth/pollution" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt;, like pesticides and heavy metals, can damage neurons and increase the risk of Parkinson’s, according to Dr. George Michalopoulos, founder and chairman of The Neurologic Wellness Institute in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"Aerobic exercise can be neuroprotective and improve motor function."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While it’s impossible to avoid all toxins, there are steps you can take to reduce your exposure," he told Fox News Digital. "Choose organic produce when possible, use protective gear if you’re working with chemicals, and drink filtered water to avoid contaminants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No. 4: Prioritize sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During deep sleep, the brain clears out waste products and repairs itself, Michalopoulos noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chronic sleep deprivation or conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; can increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s," he said. "Stick to a consistent sleep schedule, avoid screens before bed and create a calming bedtime routine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/even-small-amounts-alcohol-linked-higher-dementia-risk-older-adults-study-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS OF ALCOHOL LINKED TO HIGHER DEMENTIA RISK IN OLDER ADULTS, STUDY SHOWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vibhash Sharma, a neurologist and medical director of UT Southwestern’s neuromodulation movement disorders clinic in Dallas, Texas, reiterated the importance of quality sleep for Parkinson’s prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As poor sleep quality and chronic sleep deprivation are associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease, quality and adequate sleep is important for supporting brain repair and clearing abnormal proteins linked to Parkinson’s disease," he told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No. 5: Manage stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress is a part of life, but &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/stress-and-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;chronic levels&lt;/a&gt; can take a toll on your brain, Picone cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It’s been linked to inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which are thought to play a role in Parkinson’s," she said. "Finding ways to manage stress can help protect your brain and improve your overall health. Try &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/mind-and-body" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mindfulness practices&lt;/a&gt; like meditation, deep breathing or even a daily walk in nature."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No. 6: Stay mentally and socially engaged&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping your brain active and staying connected with others can help build "cognitive reserve," which may protect against neurodegeneration, according to Michalopoulos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Try mindfulness practices like meditation, deep breathing or even a daily walk in nature, one expert suggested.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Activities that challenge your brain — like doing puzzles, reading or learning a new skill — are great for keeping sharp," he told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sabanci reiterated that lifelong learning, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/relationships" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;social connection&lt;/a&gt; and purposeful activity support brain resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No. 7: Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoking and heavy drinking have been linked to an increased risk of Parkinson’s, Michalopoulos warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Quitting smoking and moderating &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/beer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;alcohol intake&lt;/a&gt; can go a long way toward protecting your brain," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts agreed, however, that none of these behavioral changes completely guarantees protection from Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But taken together, they form a practical, low-risk approach to support brain longevity," Sabancı said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyone with motor changes, loss of smell, REM sleep behavior disorder or persistent constipation should seek medical evaluation early."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="article-meta"&gt;&lt;div class="author-bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melissa Rudy is senior health editor and a member of the lifestyle team at Fox News Digital.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3r9z26000x27pac8d440am@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A type of mosquito that was believed to have evolved in the London Underground has a much older origin in the Mediterranean, according to a new genetic study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00023d60cr43gqeu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The myth originated during World War II when Londoners sheltering from German warplanes in subway stations had to endure bites from mosquitoes. The pests were so well adapted to the city’s subterranean tunnels that, in the following decades, biologists started to suggest they might have evolved down there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00033d608cjvbmpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The mosquito in question is commonly known as the northern house mosquito, and it exists in two forms, identical in appearance but different in behavior. One is called Culex pipiens form pipiens, which only bites birds and lives in open air environments, and the other is called Culex pipiens form&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;molestus — from the Latin word for annoying — which bites humans and thrives belowground.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00043d60ocvkc9u1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was the latter variant, some biologists thought, that could have adapted to thrive in London’s Tube stations. “That theory was made really famous by a genetic study published in 1999, which claimed, based on what I would say was limited evidence, that the ‘London Underground mosquito’ seemed to have evolved (on site) from aboveground population,” said Yuki Haba, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University and first author of the new study that &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ady4515?adobe_mc=MCMID=32040115521268807963986547309462626171%25257CMCORGID=242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%25252540AdobeOrg%25257CTS=1761227097" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the journal Science.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00053d60vqy2s9er@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the study, Haba and his colleagues analyzed the DNA sequences of hundreds of mosquitoes from all over the world, including some historical samples that were alive during World War II, and concluded that molestus did not rapidly evolve below the surface of the English capital but has a much longer history.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00063d60x4oyxi69@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a lot older than the London Tube, and it seems to have evolved around the Mediterranean region, particularly in the Middle Eastern region,” said Haba, adding that the split between the aboveground pipiens and the belowground molestus could have occurred as early as 10,000 years ago, and as late as 1,000 years ago, but most likely between 3,000 and 2,000 years ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00073d60vfnq3jsn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The evolutionary analysis suggests that those ancestral molestus populations were aboveground,” he added, “and they kind of gradually dispersed to other places of the world, including the London Underground.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00093d602tlzq08j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The team’s quest to test the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis rigorously started in 2018. “We literally googled Culex pipiens and emailed every author of every paper that we found about the mosquito, telling them we needed samples to understand the origin and genetic diversity of the species,” Haba said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000a3d60avpflu6o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thousands of emails and a few years later, the researchers had collected dead mosquitoes — preserved in ethanol — from more than 200 sources across 50 countries. They couldn’t get any live ones from the London Underground itself, as the scientists were denied permission to collect insects directly from the Tube. They instead used historical samples collected throughout the 1900s, conserved at London’s Natural History Museum and analyzed by the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a genomics research center.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000b3d604zjes5f3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In total, the researchers analyzed 357 contemporary mosquitoes and 22 historical specimens, and used additional mosquito samples from a separate study, which beefed up the overall count to about 800.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000c3d60e5utgax3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our data shows that molestus is descended directly from pipiens populations that still thrive in the Mediterranean region,” said Lindy McBride, senior author of the study and an associate professor of evolutionary genomics and neuroscience at Princeton University. This finding suggests that it “evolved at Mediterranean latitudes, but probably in the Middle East, where it’s actually too arid for the bird-biting variant to exist.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000d3d60oxin9equ@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At roughly that time, people in the area were starting to create agricultural communities that used irrigation systems, providing ideal places for the mosquito to breed and enabling it to colonize these arid areas and then adapt to humans, McBride said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000e3d60k07xmk17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings are corroborated by the fact that molestus was first &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3426333/" target="_blank"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; as a species in 1775 in Egypt by naturalist Peter Forsskål. “It had probably been there for 1,000 years, at least, before that,” McBride said. “It was then documented in southern Europe in two places, Croatia and Italy, in the 1800s and then the first records from belowground sites in Northern Europe are from about 1920.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000f3d60iryuy50o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This sequences of detection suggest that molestus traveled north, and once it hit climates too cold to survive in the open, it found refuge underground. “They can’t survive the cold winter, so they would have been confined to southern France, Italy, Greece, Spain,” McBride said. “They couldn’t have gotten much further north than that until there were underground structures to occupy during the winter.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000g3d6017nfk1ja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are over 3,000 species of mosquitoes, and they have by now colonized every continent except Antarctica. A mosquito was just found for the first time in Iceland, a country previously believed to be free of the insects due to its cold climate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000i3d60o7telfe9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Richard Nichols, a professor of genetics at Queen Mary University of London, was not involved with the research but was one of the authors of the 1999 paper that popularized the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis. Nichols said in an email that he thinks the new study is wonderful and convincing, and although it comes to different conclusions than his own research, “that’s how science works.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000j3d60rbhirb28@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 1999 study, he continued, showed that the underground mosquitoes in London were genetically distinct from the aboveground populations, and had distinguishing characteristics that helped them live underground, such as the ability to go through the life cycle without a blood meal, indiscriminate biting when the opportunity arose, and an ability to mate in confined spaces and breed throughout the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We interpreted these results to imply that some of the above underground population had adapted to the London (Tube) system and become reproductively isolated from them,” he said, acknowledging that the data from the new study, which is sourced from more places and has greater genetic diversity, reveals new information that was not available at the time. “In those days we could only readily survey 20 genes — not whole genomes,” he explained.

            Cameron Webb, an associate professor of medical entomology at the University of Sydney and NSW Health Pathology in Australia, called it a fascinating and comprehensive study of the evolution of this globally important mosquito. “While often portrayed as having adapted specifically to the London Underground, this mosquito is actually well known to be associated with subterranean habitats around the world,” Webb, who was not involved with the work but has conducted research on molestus mosquitoes, wrote in an email. The study demonstrates the ancestral basis for the ability of this mosquito to exploit the London Underground, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000n3d6010wyn7z0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The “London Underground mosquito” highlights the need to better understand the biology of less-studied mosquitoes to see how they may exploit the changing urban landscape and bring with them increased pest and public health concerns, Webb concluded. “As the design of our cities adapts in response to a changing climate, we must ensure we don’t create more opportunities for mosquitoes.”

        &lt;p&gt;The benefits of semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, aren’t just limited to treating obesity. New research shows that semaglutide can protect people’s hearts regardless of how many pounds they lose while taking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists examined data from a large-scale clinical trial of people with obesity and pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Compared to people on placebo, they found, those on semaglutide were less likely to develop heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems—even when people hadn’t lost much weight at all. The results indicate that semaglutide can improve heart health in more than one way, the researchers and outside experts say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings “highlight that the cardioprotective effects of semaglutide may be independent of adiposity and weight loss,” Laurence Sperling, a preventive cardiologist at Emory University not affiliated with the study, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Good for the heart&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide and other GLP-1 drugs have heralded a new era of obesity (and diabetes) treatment. But for a time, it was unclear if these drugs would also improve people’s cardiovascular health, and to what extent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk (the makers of Ozempic and Wegovy) funded a large, randomized, controlled, and double-blinded study designed to answer that open question—the SELECT trial. It involved roughly 17,000 people with obesity and a history of cardiovascular disease, who were followed for up to five years. The primary results from the SELECT trial, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2307563"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; almost two years ago, showed that high-dose semaglutide (the version approved as Wegovy for treating obesity) reduced people’s risk of heart attacks and other major cardiovascular events by 20% during the study period. Based on these findings, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-reduce-risk-serious-heart-problems-specifically-adults-obesity-or"&gt;expanded&lt;/a&gt; its approval of Wegovy to also cover the prevention of cardiovascular disease in high-risk groups.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since obesity is known to increase the risk of heart disease, it’s easy to assume that semaglutide’s heart benefits are mostly tied to helping people lose weight. But &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050173824000197"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; has already suggested it’s more complicated than that. In this new research, some of the researchers who conducted the SELECT trial took a closer look at their data.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They ultimately found no clear relationship between how much weight someone had lost early into the study (20 weeks in) and their reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The heart-protective benefits of semaglutide were also largely the same across different baseline weight groups. In other words, someone who was overweight (a body mass index between 27 and 30) at the start of the study tended to see a similar reduction in heart disease risk as compared to someone with the highest level of obesity (a BMI over 40).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This gives us important information that maybe we should be looking at the indication for these drugs beyond just whether your BMI is more than 27,” Howard Weintraub, preventive cardiologist and clinical director at the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart, told Gizmodo. Weintraub was one of the lead researchers of the original SELECT trial but wasn’t involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The study did see an association between someone’s waist circumference throughout the study and heart disease risk. The more a person’s waist shrunk, for instance, the greater reduction in risk they had. Waist circumference is another measure of excess body fat. So semaglutide’s slimming of body fat does seem to help explain why it prevents heart disease—but only partly. The researchers estimated that just a third of semaglutide’s effect on lowering cardiovascular disease could be accounted for by a trimming waistline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01375-3/fulltext"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in The Lancet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Beyond weight loss&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors say these findings could have far-reaching implications for how semaglutide and similar GLP-1 drugs should be used. If its heart benefits are largely independent of weight loss, then it wouldn’t be helpful to limit the prescribing of these drugs based solely on BMI. People taking semaglutide who lose enough weight to no longer qualify as obese might still benefit from continuing the drug for its heart-protective effects—just as those who don’t lose much weight may, too.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s even possible that GLP-1 therapy could one day be reframed as a standalone treatment for heart disease, regardless of BMI. Richard Kovacs, the interim chief of cardiovascular medicine at Indiana University’s School of Medicine, who is not involved with the study, notes that these findings could shape future guidelines in how doctors manage cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is a potential guideline changer because of its robust effect here. This is a well-run, large trial that we’re all familiar with. It’s an important analysis of it,” Kovacs, who is also the chief medical officer for the American College of Cardiology, told Gizmodo. At the same time, he adds, it would probably still take more data from at least one other large randomized trial for such a change to happen easily.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;One important question left to answer is exactly how these drugs can improve our heart health. The researchers argue that some of the drug’s protection likely stems from its anti-inflammatory effects, both on excess body fat and elsewhere. But the drug’s influence on blood sugar control or our blood vessels could also be playing a part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet another question is whether these heart-bolstering effects can be seen in people who aren’t overweight or obese—something that Kovacs suspects will be put to the test soon enough. And it’s still important to study whether similar benefits are apparent with other GLP-1 medications, including newer drugs that are combining GLP-1s with other compounds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, this research is continuing to demonstrate that there’s still so much left to learn about these already game-changing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we know everything that the GLP-1 agonists do yet,” Weintraub said. “So doctors will need to look at this beyond the prism of a TikTok video, where kids are looking to lose a couple of pounds to look better. That may certainly happen, but I think the cosmetic issues and the role of weight loss are just a small part of it. And as a cardiologist, I’m more motivated by the sort of findings we’re seeing here in reducing cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Along with an unfriendly clime, these winter months can usher in some unwelcome feelings in the guise of the “winter blues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the winter blues, and how can you get your energy back if all you want to do is bundle up and hibernate the season away? We spoke with several experts to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winter blues are fairly common, Amy Sedgwick, director of clinical operations at &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/MountainsideTreatment/"&gt;Mountainside, a rehabilitation center&lt;/a&gt;, explains. She explains that the winter blues are usually amplified feelings of stress and/or sadness that many experience around the holiday season, typically starting when daylight saving time ends in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Less sunlight, shorter days, and the pressure to remain upbeat during the holiday season can cause people to feel withdrawn and upset, even if they have never been diagnosed with depression,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the winter blues, or feeling down or depressed when the days are shorter and the nights are longer, could be a sign of &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/seasonal-affective-disorder" rel="nofollow"&gt;seasonal affective disorder&lt;/a&gt;. This is a specific type of depression that is only present during certain parts of the year, and wintertime is the most common season for it to crop up. If you are feeling exceptionally sad and/or hopeless, it may be time to see a doctor or mental health professional. But for your average cases of winter blues, these tips from experts should help get you out of your funk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of energy often accompanies a general feeling of being down in the dumps. How can you get a little pep back in your step if you just want to cover yourself in blankets and binge Netflix?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;People who don’t feel like hibernating slugs every winter swear by these 7 energy habits:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

                                    &lt;span class="half-and-half__title h5"&gt;New cancer therapy ‘a major step forward’&lt;/span&gt;
                
                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A pioneering procedure that deploys ultrasound to destroy tumours is “a major and exciting step forward in cancer treatment”, doctors said this week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Histotripsy uses sound waves to create microscopic bubbles from gases present in tumour tissues. The bubbles form and collapse in microseconds, destroying cancer cells without the need for surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. With treatment taking as little as 30 minutes, patients can recover quickly and spend less time in hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roger Jackson, 80, is the first patient in Europe to receive the treatment for his liver cancer. “I feel privileged,” he said. “It’s impressive to think that sound waves can treat cancer, without the need for patients like me to go through intensive surgery, at what already is a stressful time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jackson (pictured) was treated at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, England, which is currently the only hospital in the country offering the therapy.     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Histotripsy represents a hugely exciting and new era of cancer innovation and care,” said the hospital’s chief exec Roland Sinker. “With faster recovery times … this not only reduces the strain on our hospital beds, but also frees up surgeons to focus on the more complex cancer cases.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies are underway to explore histotripsy’s effectiveness on other cancer types. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While common symptoms include abdominal pain, jaundice, and unexplained weight loss, recent research shows that certain leg symptoms may appear first. Patients may experience pain, swelling, redness, or warmth in the legs, which can serve as early warning signs of pancreatic cancer. Recognising these subtle indicators is vital for timely diagnosis and treatment, potentially improving survival rates. With pancreatic cancer causing over a million deaths globally each year, awareness of both traditional and early leg symptoms is crucial for prevention and early intervention. This aggressive cancer often spreads quickly to nearby organs and is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage, making early detection and awareness even more essential. Take a look...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Pancreatic cancer From signs to treatment process, expert explains how to manage the condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leg pain, swelling, redness: Spotting common symptoms of pancreatic cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1. Pain in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent or unexplained pain in the legs can be a subtle yet significant warning sign. This discomfort may arise from deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein, often in the legs. According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/signs-and-symptoms.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in the context of pancreatic cancer, DVT can occur due to the body's altered clotting mechanisms, which are influenced by the presence of cancerous cells &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Swelling in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexplained swelling in one or both legs, especially if it develops suddenly, can indicate the presence of a blood clot or other circulatory issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In pancreatic cancer patients, such swelling may be linked to DVT or the compression of blood vessels by tumour growth, leading to impaired blood flow. Persistent swelling accompanied by pain, redness, or warmth should be evaluated promptly, as early detection can prevent serious complications and improve treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Redness in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redness or a reddish hue in the skin of the legs can be a sign of inflammation or infection. In the case of DVT associated with pancreatic cancer, the affected area may appear red due to increased blood flow as the body attempts to combat the clot. This discolouration is often accompanied by warmth, tenderness, and mild swelling, indicating underlying circulatory issues that require immediate medical evaluation to prevent potentially life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Warmth in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sensation of warmth in the legs, particularly around the swollen or painful areas, can indicate inflammation. This warmth is often a response to the body's immune system reacting to the clot or tumour. In pancreatic cancer, such symptoms may be among the first to manifest, preceding more typical signs like jaundice or abdominal pain. Persistent warmth accompanied by redness, tenderness, or swelling should not be ignored, as it may signal deep vein thrombosis or tumour-related vascular complications requiring prompt medical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;See More: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/cancer-breakthrough-scientists-discover-protein-that-could-stop-tumour-growth-in-the-pancreas/articleshow/124158628.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cancer breakthrough: Scientists discover protein that could stop tumour growth in the pancreas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why do these symptoms matter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of these leg symptoms, especially when they occur without an obvious cause, should not be dismissed. They may serve as early indicators of pancreatic cancer, prompting timely medical evaluation and intervention.

Fortunately, my favorite yoga instructor Adriene Mishler—better known to her 13 million &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; subscribers as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/yoga-with-adriene" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/yoga-with-adriene"&gt;Yoga With Adriene&lt;/a&gt;—recently shared a routine dedicated to mobilising the lower back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="b54d8892-8894-4516-bdc9-c94268d719dc-2"&gt;It’s just 10 minutes long and it doesn’t require any equipment, so I was keen to give it a go as a much-needed break from my working day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what happened when I tried it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-do-yoga-with-adriene-s-10-minute-lower-back-mobility-routine" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-yoga-with-adriene-s-10-minute-lower-back-mobility-routine"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do Yoga With Adriene’s 10-minute lower-back mobility routine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="16fbca9f-3276-466a-87ce-a47b6a0bd852"&gt;You don’t need any equipment to do this routine, although you might want to roll out your yoga mat, or at least a folded towel, to cushion your knees, because you kneel for some of the poses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-my-experience-trying-yoga-with-adriene-s-lower-back-mobility-routine" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-experience-trying-yoga-with-adriene-s-lower-back-mobility-routine"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My experience trying Yoga With Adriene’s lower-back mobility routine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="6464552e-19ce-4b33-8497-0aa3415ea63c"&gt;I feel like I’ve tried every stretch under the sun, but there were a couple of movements in this routine that I hadn’t come across before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One involved bringing my knees to my chest and then pushing them away from the body, which activated my pelvic floor muscles and stretched my lower back. The other was pelvic tilts, which felt so good in my lower back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hnqDtVAMxmuELfFheZEADf" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hnqDtVAMxmuELfFheZEADf slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These exercises not only stretched my lower back, but also activated the muscles surrounding it, which should help to reduce stiffness in the long term, so I’ll definitely come back to these moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the video took the same approach to a series of exercises, performing them dynamically first—moving in and out of position—and then passively, holding the stretch for a few breaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moves include supine twists, extended child’s pose and cat-cow, all of which felt great for my stiff back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was a satisfying routine for someone like me with an achy lower back and my entire body felt less stiff after doing it. I’d recommend it for anyone who needs a short break from a sedentary routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="2b349082-5d31-4c67-9fcd-82e9461157ab"&gt;It’s been a hit in the comments too, and a few people have said it reminds them of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-05m7bboK0" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-05m7bboK0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;lower back love video&lt;/a&gt; Mishler published in 2014.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roanoke, Virginia&lt;/em&gt; — As a 10-year-old, Autumn Bushman loved to perform. The fourth-grade cheerleader from Salem, Virginia, was a bundle of energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She really turned my living room into a dance floor," her mother, Summer Bushman, told CBS News. "She never sat still...She really did care about others more than she cared about herself." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for the past couple of years, Summer says Autumn was bullied in school over her braces. The abuse also continued after school on her smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 21, at the age of 10, Autumn died by suicide at night in her bedroom. Records show she was looking at her phone's screen just before it happened, Summer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer told CBS News her daughter would take her phone to bed at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I had questioned that a couple of times, and she fought back and said, 'Mom, I need my alarm,'" Summer said. "And every single morning when I'd wake her up, she had her alarm going off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from researchers at Virginia Tech shows nighttime screen use and easy access to over-the-counter medicines are linked to teen suicide attempts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/10/study-sheds-light-on-overdose-suicide-attempts-among-youth-and-w.html?utm_campaign=organicVTunirel&amp;amp;utm_medium=Virginia+Tech&amp;amp;utm_source=cmpgn_soc&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawNneY5leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFxanNqNXVTMXlNeUlsSmpGAR737BMQJHB22mLCWTHsWIJtbwcl6ubTD5zzqasiJYE_BhaVrtbisodKMXhA0g_aem_O5CsolpF6bKgGiuJh9YUhA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The study examined&lt;/a&gt; data of children ages 12 to 17 who had been admitted to a hospital after attempting suicide by intentionally overdosing. It found that about two-thirds of those overdosed after 8 p.m., and approximately three out of four were on screens right before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is very distracting and disturbs your sleep," Dr. Abhishek Reddy, a clinical psychiatrist and professor at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine who conducted the research, said of screen use before bed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddy added that it is "pretty dangerous" for bullied children to take their phones to bed at night "because during the daytime, you can talk to people, you can talk to school counselors, you can talk to your family members, friends. But at nighttime, all that access is cut off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommends keeping phones out of bedrooms, practicing good sleep hygiene, and reducing access to all medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I come in here and I think, you know, it's been six months since she's been gone, it's been seven months since she's been gone. And then I think to myself, I have to go the rest of my life without seeing her again," Summer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer wishes she had never given Autumn a smartphone so young, let alone allowed her to use it at night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She deserved to live life, and I will never see her go to a homecoming or prom," Summer said. "I'll never see her, you know, get married, or in a wedding dress. And that's really difficult."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://988lifeline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;988 Suicide &amp;amp; Crisis Lifeline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; by calling or texting 988.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38tqux00aj26oz4x4668v8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not surprising that many people fear the dentist. Replacing a tooth often requires invasive surgery and implanting a titanium screw into a patient’s jawbone, then waiting months for that to strengthen into an artificial root, before attaching a crown or cap on top of it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00063b6n8lk4gh5h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But research groups around the world are working to find ways to implant or grow real biological teeth in a human jaw.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00073b6n4kvi97pj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That may be a way off, but at King’s College London, Ana Angelova Volponi, director of the postgraduate program in regenerative dentistry, has been experimenting with lab-grown teeth for almost two decades, and was part of a team that in 2013 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23458883/" target="_blank"&gt;grew a tooth &lt;/a&gt;from human and mouse cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00083b6nx32ub98d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This year, she led a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39532305/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that built upon that work and achieved a breakthrough in the material used to house the growing tooth in the lab, which better mimics the actual environment where biological teeth grow in the mouth. It’s a key step on the way to replacing the mouse cells with human cells and stimulating them to form a tooth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00093b6ne7zrtypj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The idea of creating lab-grown teeth dates back to the 1980s, Volponi said, but the one that she and her colleagues created over a decade ago was the first that used adult human gingival cells — which make up the gums and are obtained by lightly scratching the inside of the mouth — and combined them with “progenitor” tooth cells taken from a mouse embryo.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000a3b6n6eksaw8u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s almost like a tripod,” she said about the elements that contribute to growing a tooth in a lab setting. “The two types of cells are engaging in tooth making, in a sort of conversation, and then we have the environment where this happens.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000b3b6nksdqhjnu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The environment, which researchers call a “scaffold,” is essential to the formation of the lab-grown tooth, and it’s the subject of Volponi’s most recent study. In 2013, Volponi used a scaffold made of the protein collagen, but now uses a hydrogel, a type of polymer with a high water content, explained Xuechen Zhang, a doctoral student at King’s College London, and a co-author of the study. “We gather the cells first from the mouse embryos and then mix them together and spin them down to get a small cell pellet,” he said. “Then we inject this cell pellet inside the hydrogel and grow it for around eight days.” Because the work focused on the environment, human cells aren’t needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000c3b6nphp2ih3i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the end of the eight days, tooth-like structures will have formed inside the hydrogel, which was developed in collaboration with Imperial College London. In the 2013 research, these “tooth primordia” were transferred into a mouse where they developed into a tooth structure complete with developing roots and enamel.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000d3b6nyj8yc13m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many challenges remain before a lab-grown tooth can be used in a human patient, but the new material helps with some pieces of that puzzle, Volponi said, by improving the “conversation” between the cells that are tasked with making a tooth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000e3b6nrxthzi6y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers still don’t know exactly how to replace the embryonic mouse cells with adult human cells, but if that puzzle is solved, Volponi envisions two possible ways to integrate lab-grown teeth into everyday dentistry: “We either grow a tooth up to a certain stage of development, and then embed it into the (tooth socket), where a lost tooth was and where the new one will have the potential to fully grow into a biological tooth, incorporating itself within the organic structures such as the bone and the ligament. Or, we fully grow the tooth first and then implant it surgically. It’s still too early to say which approach will be more viable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000g3b6n7cdnstyy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A real, biological replacement tooth grown from a patient’s own cells would offer many advantages over a crown or implant. First, it would be accepted into the tissue without inflammation or rejection, but it would also feel exactly like a real tooth — unlike implants that lack feeling and elasticity as they are simply fused into the bone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000h3b6nlyrkjpm2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to Vitor C. M. Neves, a senior clinical lecturer at the School of Clinical Dentistry of the University of Sheffield in England, Volponi has long&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;been a pioneer in the field of whole tooth regeneration, serving as an inspiration to many researchers around the world. “Her new research tackles a key factor in the production and potential industrialization of this technology — the use of matrices in whole tooth regeneration,” said Neves, who was not involved with Volponi’s study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh39e1pm00153b6nipf3rorz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings, he added, highlight the importance of creating an environment that can support whole tooth engineering for clinical application: “The more researchers who contribute to advancing this field, the sooner humanity will be able to reap its benefits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000i3b6nxvf73jgd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other researchers working in the same field are using a variety of different techniques to grow teeth.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000j3b6nhcte4hnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Katsu Takahashi and his colleagues at the Medical Research Institute Kitano Hospital in Osaka are developing an antibody-based treatment aimed at promoting the growth of teeth in people with conditions such as anodontia, or the congenital lack of teeth. The treatment has entered human clinical trials and could be ready by the end of the decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000k3b6n7zilp2pt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In late 2024, a team led by Pamela Yelick at the School of Dental Medicine of Tufts University, grew human-like teeth — created from human and pig cells — &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/04/24/pigs-can-regrow-their-adult-teeth-what-if-humans-could-too" target="_blank"&gt;in pigs&lt;/a&gt;. Pigs, unlike humans, regrow their teeth several times over the course of their lives. The ultimate aim is to prompt cells in a human jaw to grow new teeth, without using any pig cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000l3b6nuc19zrso@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the University of Washington, a team led by Hannele Ruohola-Baker, a professor of biochemistry and an associate director of the university’s Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, &lt;a href="https://iscrm.uw.edu/stories/teaming-up-for-living-teeth/" target="_blank"&gt;has successfully grown&lt;/a&gt; dental pulp stem cells from human stem cells mined from donated wisdom teeth: “We aim to uncover the molecular blueprint of human tooth formation and to recreate that process in the laboratory,” she said. “While Volponi’s study builds tooth-like structures from existing dental tissues, our platform generates the key human tooth-forming cell types (from scratch) and guides them along authentic developmental trajectories.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000m3b6n1uyj51tw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for when the fruits of all this research will become available, Ruohola-Baker believes we won’t have to wait that long. “Although clinical translation will take time, momentum in this field is accelerating, heralding a future in which biological tooth repair or replacement becomes a realistic option within the coming decade,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The insulin nasal spray, which delivers insulin straight to the brain, has also been shown to keep brain cells healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carried out in the US, the trial shows some early signs of progress in maintaining brain health in those at risk of Alzheimer's. It enrolled 47 older adults aged 55 to 85 years, 42 of whom completed treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, or were cognitively fine but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awu387"&gt;showed signs of molecular changes&lt;/a&gt; linked to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were given either empagliflozin alone, the insulin spray on its own, both medications together, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;or a placebo&lt;/a&gt;, for four weeks. The trial was too small to detect any  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="178152" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt; differences between the groups (its main aim was testing safety); however, some trends were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-and-cancer-may-soon-be-treated-with-sounds-we-cant-hear"&gt;Alzheimer's And Cancer May Soon Be Treated With Sounds We Can't Hear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we found that empagliflozin, an established diabetes and heart medication, reduced markers of brain injury while restoring blood flow in critical brain regions," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.wakehealth.edu/news-releases/2025/10/new-trial-finds-diabetes-drug-and-nasal-insulin-improve-brain-health-in-early-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Suzanne Craft from the Wake Forest University School of Medicine in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also confirmed that delivering insulin directly to the brain with a newly validated device enhances cognition, neurovascular health, and immune function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178155" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178155" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TauProteins.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-178155 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TauProteins.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TauProteins-639x675.jpg 639w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TauProteins-600x634.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178155" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;One of the benefits seen with empagliflozin (EMPA-Only) was signs of less tau build-up in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). (Erichsen et al., &lt;em&gt;A&amp;amp;D&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a diabetes drug, empagliflozin improves the way the body handles glucose and sodium. This has a lot of further effects, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/anti-inflammatory-diets-are-all-over-tiktok-heres-what-the-science-says"&gt;lower inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and stress on cells, better energy efficiency, and improved insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the medication was shown to reduce the levels of the tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid, a protein that we know can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-approved-sleeping-pill-slows-alzheimers-tangles-in-pre-clinical-trial"&gt;form harmful clumps&lt;/a&gt; in Alzheimer's brains. It also had benefits in terms of blood flow and cholesterol levels, and several other biomarkers linked to Alzheimer's progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insulin nasal spray was chosen because insulin resistance has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nasal-spray-may-slow-alzheimers-disease-study-in-mice-suggests"&gt;previously been linked&lt;/a&gt; to Alzheimer's, and previous research shows insulin's effects on brain cells can help improve immune responses, white matter structure, and blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, participants given the insulin spray saw better scores on cognitive tests measuring memory and thinking. Through brain scans, the researchers observed benefits in white matter connectivity and blood flow &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-name-new-type-of-memory-loss-often-mistaken-for-alzheimers"&gt;linked to memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body's metabolism, or the way it turns fuel into energy, is crucial to good health, and these treatments focus more on that, rather than some of the later, end-stage effects of Alzheimer's we see in people with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study suggests that targeting metabolism can change the course of Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.wakehealth.edu/news-releases/2025/10/new-trial-finds-diabetes-drug-and-nasal-insulin-improve-brain-health-in-early-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Craft.

        &lt;p class="VideoEnhancement-title"&gt;Deadly strep zoo outbreak hits Bozeman dog daycare, veterinarians warn pet owners&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
        
    
    
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Bozeman dog owners said they hadn’t heard of Strep Zoo before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more, I spoke with Dr. Jessica Matlock from 360 Pet Medical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strep Zoo causes severe respiratory disease in some dogs,” Dr. Matlock explained. “So, some dogs will mount a toxic shock-type syndrome. That means a very rapid onset of pneumonia, which causes the lungs to bleed, and dogs can die within 48 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Matlock said dogs that are older or have underlying conditions such as diabetes, Cushing’s disease, or Addison’s disease, as well as puppies, are at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cold and flu season affecting pets as well as people, Dr. Matlock noted that mild respiratory symptoms like a runny nose are common. However, she warned of the signs that could indicate Strep Zoo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If nasal discharge turns from white to yellow or brown, that's an indication that there's blood,” she said. “That’s an emergency that would need to be seen by your veterinarian."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Strep Zoo is highly contagious, Dr. Matlock said pet owners often ask her if there's a risk of going to public spaces like the dog park. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Open air is better,” she said, “but a dog can still sneeze on something like a park bench, and another dog could come up right after and get potentially infected.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two dog owners we met at a local park said they still plan on taking their dogs, Neptune and James, to the dog park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their physical and social health are both big deals for us,” he said.“We definitely don’t want to be too afraid of what’s out there."  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;New guidelines on what to eat and drink if you have chronic (long-term) constipation have been making news in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the media coverage of the British Dietetic Association's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jhn.70133"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; has focused on advice to eat kiwifruit every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other recommendations have not received so much attention. One, in particular, marks a shift in managing chronic constipation. The guidelines don't advise a high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-type-of-fiber-may-have-weight-loss-benefits-similar-to-ozempic"&gt;A Type of Fiber May Have Weight Loss Benefits Similar to Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what the guidelines say help (and don't help) to relieve chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the guidelines look at?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined 75  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="178889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to come up with recommendations for food, drink and supplements for chronic constipation in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quality of the clinical trials varied and so they had to come up with a consensus on the quality of the trial data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that constipation means different things to different people, they used a very broad definition for constipation. This encompassed what patients perceived to be constipation as well as definitions of constipation used in clinical trials. Chronic constipation is generally when someone passes few, hard stools over a period of at least three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178895" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178895" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/kiwifruits.jpg" alt="kiwi fruit halved" class="wp-image-178895 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/kiwifruits.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/kiwifruits-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178895" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Researchers recommend eating two to three kiwifruit a day for at least four weeks to improve constipation. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-kiwi-cut-in-half-GAMExm6pQI0"&gt;Стейси Сакс/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers produced 59 recommendations. However, the researchers said most of the recommendations were based on poor-quality evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why kiwifruit? How many a day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recommended eating two to three kiwifruit a day for at least four weeks to improve constipation. Whether it's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000002124"&gt;green kiwifruit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14194146"&gt;gold kiwifruit&lt;/a&gt; the evidence clearly shows they can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how? There are several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibre in kiwifruit &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-6047.2002.00287.x"&gt;swells a lot&lt;/a&gt; when mixed with water, more so than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-394294-4.00005-5"&gt;apple fibre&lt;/a&gt;. This swelling helps make stools more bulky, easing their way through the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating the whole fruit including the skin provides more fibre than just eating the flesh but eating the kiwifruit without the skin is perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green kiwifruit contains an enzyme called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114513003401"&gt;actinidin&lt;/a&gt; that helps the body digest protein in the stomach and the small intestine. This may help with constipation by making food proteins softer and easier to pass through the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit contain a type of crystal called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2017.1327841"&gt;raphides&lt;/a&gt;. These are believed to increase mucus production in the gut, lubricating it and helping passage of the stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating kiwifruit may also result in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/pr300646m"&gt;reduced species of methane producing bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, which have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2009.655"&gt;linked to constipation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mineral water and magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reported on the benefits of drinking mineral water. They suggested drinking 0.5–1.5 litres a day (roughly two to six cups) of mineral water for two to six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Mineral water &lt;a href="https://afcd.foodstandards.gov.au/fooddetails.aspx?PFKID=F005696"&gt;often contains magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12072052"&gt;acts as a laxative&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, magnesium oxide is often used as a dietary &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020421"&gt;supplement&lt;/a&gt; for chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines confirmed magnesium oxide can help soften the stool and increase stool frequency. The researchers recommended taking 0.5–1. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5g" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73071" data-postid="178889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;5g&lt;/a&gt; a day for at least four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this may not be appropriate for everyone. For instance people with kidney disease need to be careful. Magnesium supplements may also interact with other medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rye bread&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers cited &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.109.118570"&gt;studies showing&lt;/a&gt; rye bread relieves constipation more than white bread or common laxatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recommended six to eight slices a day of rye bread for at least three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this just isn't realistic for a lot of people. And as rye contains gluten, this would not be appropriate for people with coeliac disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A high-fibre diet may not be needed after all&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was one key surprise in the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers said there was a lack of strong evidence for generic high-fibre diets for constipation, when people eat at &lt;a href="https://nutritionaustralia.org/resources/fibre-2/"&gt;least 25g&lt;/a&gt; of fibre a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the rationale. The researchers could only find &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gastrohep.2023.01.012"&gt;one randomised controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; – the gold standard for testing interventions, such as a change in diet – where a high-fibre diet (25–30g/day) was compared with a low-fibre diet (15–20g/day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trial showed no benefit for the high-fibre diet in improving constipation. People on the low-fibre diet farted less and were less bloated than people on the high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean fibre doesn't help constipation. There is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.13662"&gt;good evidence&lt;/a&gt; for supplementing your diet with more fibre to help chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But rather than focusing on a high-fibre diet for constipation, the guidelines instead recommend taking at least 10g a day of a fibre supplement, such as psyllium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-fibre diet is usually a key part of national dietary guidelines. For example the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; recommends some adults have a dietary fibre intake of at least 28g a day. There are certainly health benefits such as lowered cholesterol and blood sugar levels from eating a high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we now know it's not needed to relieve chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can we take away from the guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These guidelines provide more personalised, evidence-based dietary advice tailored to patient symptoms than previous guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit are considered a safe and effective treatment for chronic constipation. Mineral water, magnesium supplements and rye bread can help too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it would be worth discussing magnesium supplements with a health professional, especially if there are concerns about kidney disease or you take other medications.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267617/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Chapman put one hemisphere on ice for pathology and toxicology before also being used for research. The other was already softening, becoming harder to handle. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Nyanchoka dipped it in a chemical bath that hardened the tissue, then lowered on top of it a cage-like metal frame with slats every 5 millimeters. Those slats ensure her cuts across the brain, carving it into thin slices, are evenly spaced. Each brain yields between 30 and 35 cross sections that over decades will have pieces of them removed and shipped to research labs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In a meeting before the dissection, the lab workers looked alarmed as Berretta discussed the budget. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“You’re not in danger of losing your jobs,” she quickly assured them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There is a risk, though, that the center could not pay overtime for workers on call to receive a brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Unlike other organ donations, brain donations usually have to be approved by family after a person’s death. The brain banks need their cooperation for the most current health information about the donor and details of that person’s life.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Families whose relatives suffered from a neurological or psychiatric condition are more likely to be aware donations are possible, Berretta said, but it’s a constant challenge to obtain healthy brains to serve as critical controls researchers use to identify key differences in ones affected by illness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

The technique, called enteral ventilation, delivers oxygen via a liquid squeezed into the rectum, where the oxygen is then absorbed by intestines. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/med/abstract/S2666-6340(25)00314-9?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.cell.com/med/abstract/S2666-6340(25)00314-9?ref=404media.co"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, the worst side effect patients experienced from the procedure was mild bloating. Speaking to &lt;a href="https://www.404media.co/breathing-through-our-butts-declared-safe-after-first-human-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.404media.co/breathing-through-our-butts-declared-safe-after-first-human-trial/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;404 Media&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;Dr. Takanori Takebe said enteral ventilation was â€œnot meant to replace mechanical ventilators or ECMO, but rather to serve as a complementary oxygenation route.â€�&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Though the test concluded that the process is safe, it has yet to be tested on patients suffering respiratory failure. If future testing is successful, enteral ventilation could serve as a temporary measure to help patients get oxygen before normal lung function resumes or a patient can get on a ventilator. This could prove particularly helpful for newborn infants or patients suffering from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="read-it-at-btn" href="https://www.cell.com/med/abstract/S2666-6340(25)00314-9?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Read it at &lt;span&gt;Med&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Daily Beast</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 21:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE84M3NvcGh2YWpPbnRSLTBhTGYwaHBQb0c0SGZaM1ZValhUMUtneUltMk5QbUtyaDBWT2JmWmV4T0p6QVFLU1Rtd1g3NHZpUjRBN0ZRZzc5c1RJa3V4SFh6NHpNNm16T0ItblJSTXdTOXpjOExFczRnbXVFa1o</guid></item><item><title>列|一切都是蛋白质，但蛋白质并不是一切。以下是须知事项。-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2025/10/23/protein-muscle-mass-weight-loss-faqs/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S5JRGBI4YJBPNDHSUBV7YZB5QU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;First, they came for fat.
