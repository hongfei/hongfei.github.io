Although the agency did not provide specific data for California cases, it described the seasonal flu activity as “elevated” in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Flu started to rise, in earnest, by mid-December and rates are still up,” said Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional physician chief of infectious diseases for Kaiser Permanente. “We are hoping to see some plateauing in the next few weeks, but there’s some delay in data due to recent holidays, so it will become clearer in the next week or so.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudson said most flu-related cases are being treated without the need for hospital admittance, “but those who are older or at higher risk for complications from the flu are the ones we’re mostly seeing admitted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/RespiratoryVirusReport.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;data from the public health agency&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a high rate of positive flu cases in Central California and the Bay Area and a moderate rate around Sacramento and Southern California. In the northern part of the state where it’s more rural, the rate of flu cases is currently low, according to the  agency’s website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Los Angeles County, &lt;a class="link" href="https://ph.lacounty.gov/acd/respwatch/#Hospitalizations" target="_blank"&gt;recent data from the health department&lt;/a&gt; show that between the end of last year and the start of 2026, there were 162 flu-related hospitalizations and an additional 18 cases in which patients were admitted for intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, this flu season has led to the highest number of cases in the U.S. in more than 30 years. The &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates&lt;/a&gt; that there have been at least 15 million infections in the U.S., with 180,000 hospitalizations and 7,400 deaths, since late fall. At least two of those who died have been children, said Yvonne Maldonado, the Taube professor of global health and infectious disease at Stanford Medicine, &lt;a class="link" href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2026/01/not-super-flu-but-plenty-bad-expert-tips.html" target="_blank"&gt;in a news release&lt;/a&gt;. The state’s Department of Public Health  confirmed that those pediatric flu-associated deaths occurred in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, infectious disease experts had &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-12-23/flu-season-hits-california-early-doctors-worry-itll-be-hard-on-kids"&gt;predicted this flu season would be particularly bad for high-risk groups, specifically children&lt;/a&gt;, due to a decline in flu vaccination rates and a “souped-up mutant” flu strain, Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases expert at UC San Francisco, told The Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year’s flu season was one of the worst, “but little did we know what was in store for us this year,” said Dr. Neha Nanda, medical director of antimicrobial stewardship with Keck Medicine of USC.  Nanda said she is seeing an early upward trend in positive influenza cases this season compared with previous years, though it isn’t quite on par with last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sam Torbati, co-chair and medical director of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center’s emergency department, said that around the second week of December he saw a lot of patients coming into his department with flu-related illnesses, part of a surge in hospitalizations that was seen throughout the county. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he doesn’t recall “seeing this many patients becoming this ill.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very early in the flu season and may get much worse,” Torbati said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts believe the strain has mutated to “more likely evade” immunity from the current vaccine. That’s because the strain emerged toward the end of the summer, long after health officials had already determined the formula for the flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Current seasonal flu vaccines remain effective at reducing severe illness and hospitalization, including the currently circulating viruses,” said Dr. Erica Pan,  state public health officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the flu shot might not keep you from succumbing to the illness, “it lessens your odds of having a severe case, keeps you out of the hospital and shortens the duration of the illness,” said Dr. Michelle Barron, senior medical director of infection prevention and control for UCHealth, in a report by the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.aamc.org/news/10-things-know-about-year-s-surprisingly-fierce-flu-season" target="_blank"&gt;Assn. of American Medical Colleges&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials are urging the public, especially those at higher risk for severe flu complications such as the very young and older populations, to get vaccinated or take immediate antiviral treatment, such as Tamifu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu can be very serious with symptoms — fatigue, fever, cough and body aches — that feel like you got “hit by a Mack truck,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For children and other high-risk individuals, the symptoms can be more severe.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Children can develop dehydration [or] pneumonia, and more severe cases of flu in kids can lead to inflammation of the brain and heart,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem has not been limited to the U.S. The influenza A strain, H3N2 subclade K, has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-11-25/california-flu-season-could-see-early-sharp-start-due-to-mutation"&gt;caused severe flu seasons in&lt;/a&gt; Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 20:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxPTWdvNGg0bVhUeGRwUkYyT3Bhck1IQTVrZm5NbUdjYTlLS01GeGp3d2NjWEVvb2xlekhWaFZXYmFoalNqQUpBb2JGTm9YcXBCZVBfY3dqMmRnN2g2X0hqWENiTlQxN2lIWjJGVnJ0cWR2Q215bmdoWS1hRDdtQXdkbVAtVmZsOUJYdVVlRkZoQXNybldVbGxhTERUVmU4Yi1EMDRPSl8wMXJoN2lzX0dnQnlSbw</guid></item><item><title>Buncombe县兄弟姐妹报告了2例新的儿科麻疹病例：卫生官员- WLOS</title><link>https://wlos.com/news/local/2-new-measles-cases-confirmed-buncombe-county-siblings-health-north-carolina-human-services-vaccine-unvaccinated-upstate-outbreak-pediatric</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;BUNCOMBE COUNTY, N.C. (WLOS) — &lt;/span&gt;Two new cases of measles have been confirmed in unvaccinated siblings in Buncombe County, according to local officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two affected individuals are preschool- and school-age children, one of whom attends Asheville-Pisgah Christian School, which has a 41% vaccination rate for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brings the total number of measles cases in North Carolina to seven since late December, with five of those in Buncombe County, per a press release from the county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two affected children are in isolation and public health officials are conducting contact tracing, the county said. School administrators are notifying parents and guardians about the potential exposure, while public health staff are reaching out to those who may have been exposed to provide guidance on reducing further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/buncombe-county-measles-vaccination-rates-outbreak-risk-north-carolina-department-health-human-services-dashboard" target="_blank"&gt;OFFICIALS: BUNCOMBE COUNTY'S HIGHER EXEMPTION RATES FOR MEASLES VACCINE PUT AREA AT RISK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Measles is one of the most contagious diseases we encounter, but it is also highly preventable," said Dr. Ellis Matheson, public health director for Buncombe County, via a press release. "Our team is working quickly to identify exposed individuals, ensure appropriate follow-up, and protect our community. Vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles and its potentially serious complications."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cases are linked to an ongoing outbreak in the Upstate region of South Carolina, where at least 124 new measles cases have been reported since last Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/124-new-measles-cases-reported-south-carolina-upstate-spartanburg-outbreak-spreads-department-public-health-infection-mmr-vaccine-contagious-disease-virus" target="_blank"&gt;124 NEW MEASLES CASES REPORTED IN SOUTH CAROLINA AS OUTBREAK SPREADS: HEALTH OFFICIALS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease that spreads through direct contact and the air, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. The virus can survive in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms usually appear seven to 14 days after exposure and can include high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, tiny white spots inside the mouth, and a rash. Anyone who shows symptoms is advised to contact their local health department, limit exposure to others and call ahead before visiting a medical office, clinic or hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urge everyone aged one year or older to receive the  measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; more than 2,000 confirmed measles cases across the country.

Researchers found that the MIND diet is particularly effective at lowering the risk of conditions such as dementia, stroke, depression, and anxiety. These findings were published recently in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2025.103616" target="_blank"&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurological and psychiatric disorders represent a leading cause of disability worldwide. As the global population ages, the burden of these conditions continues to grow. Doctors currently possess few curative options for diseases like dementia. This reality makes prevention a primary goal for public health officials. Prior research has identified links between nutrition and individual health outcomes. However, previous studies often examined single dietary patterns or single diseases in isolation. This fragmented approach has left gaps in understanding how different diets compare directly against one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers sought to address these knowledge gaps. They wanted to determine which dietary patterns offer the most comprehensive benefits for the brain. The investigation was led by Yisen Shi, Yixiang Lin, and Yiling Zheng from Fujian Medical University Union Hospital in China. They aimed to create a holistic picture of the connection between food and neurological health. Their team also sought to uncover the specific biological mechanisms that explain why certain foods help or harm the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from the UK Biobank to conduct their investigation. This is a massive biomedical database containing health information from residents of the United Kingdom. The study included nearly 170,000 participants. These individuals were between the ages of 37 and 73. None of the selected participants had a diagnosis of a brain disorder at the start of the study. The research team tracked the health of these individuals for a median period of roughly ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team evaluated ten different healthy eating scores. These included well-known regimens like the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet. They also assessed the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, or MIND diet. In addition to healthy patterns, they calculated the intake of ultra-processed foods. These are industrial food products that typically contain additives, preservatives, and artificial flavorings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used statistical models to compare these diets against the incidence of five major disorders. These disorders were dementia, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, depression, and anxiety. The analysis revealed that the MIND diet offered the broadest neuroprotective effects. This eating pattern combines elements of the Mediterranean and DASH diets. It specifically emphasizes green leafy vegetables, berries, nuts, whole grains, and fish. It also advises limiting butter, cheese, and red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who adhered closely to the MIND diet saw significant benefits. The data showed a reduced likelihood of developing dementia. The risk of suffering a stroke was also lower in this group. Mental health outcomes were similarly positive. High adherence to the MIND diet correlated with lower risks for both depression and anxiety. The study did not find a significant link between the MIND diet and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results for ultra-processed foods were starkly different. High consumption of these foods was associated with negative health outcomes. The analysis linked processed food intake to an increased risk of dementia. It also showed a correlation with higher risks for depression and anxiety. Unlike the healthy dietary patterns, high consumption of ultra-processed foods was also linked to a greater risk of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers sought to confirm these findings in other populations. They utilized data from two independent groups. These were the U.S. Health and Retirement Study and the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. This validation step ensures that the results are not specific to just one region or culture. The protective associations of the MIND diet held true in these diverse cohorts. The diet was linked to better cognitive performance and fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety in both the American and Chinese groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key innovation of this study was its focus on biological mechanisms. The researchers wanted to understand how diet physically alters the body to protect the brain. They analyzed blood samples and brain imaging data from a subset of the participants. They looked at biomarkers related to metabolism, inflammation, and aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests the MIND diet works through several specific pathways. One major pathway involves metabolism. The diet appears to improve the body’s lipid profile. This includes how the body processes cholesterol and triglycerides. A favorable metabolic signature explained a large proportion of the reduced risk for stroke. It also accounted for a significant part of the reduction in depression and anxiety risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another pathway involves the biological aging process. The researchers measured markers that indicate how fast the body’s cells are aging relative to chronological age. Adherence to the MIND diet was associated with slower biological aging. This deceleration in aging appeared to be the primary way the diet reduces the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Body composition played a role as well. The MIND diet was linked to a lower Body Mass Index. This reduction in obesity contributed to the lowered risk of depression and anxiety. The diet also seemed to reduce chronic inflammation in the body. Lower inflammation levels are generally associated with better long-term health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging provided physical evidence of these benefits. The researchers examined magnetic resonance imaging scans. They found that people who followed the MIND diet had preserved brain volume in key areas. These areas included the pallidum and the thalamus. These brain structures are essential for processing sensory information and regulating emotions. High intake of ultra-processed foods was linked to reduced volume in these same areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also performed a detailed analysis of proteins in the blood. This technique is known as proteomics. They identified specific proteins that act as mediators between diet and disease. One protein called GDF-15 was highlighted. Changes in levels of this protein helped explain the link between processed foods and depression. The analysis indicated that these proteins are involved in immune responses and metabolic regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also utilized a technique called Mendelian randomization. This method uses genetic data to infer potential causal relationships. The results supported the idea that the diet’s metabolic effects directly influence aging and obesity markers. This strengthens the argument that the diet causes the health improvements rather than just being associated with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are limitations to this research. It is primarily an observational study. This design can identify strong associations but cannot definitively prove cause and effect. Participants reported their own dietary intake through questionnaires. Self-reported data is subject to memory errors and may not capture long-term changes in eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study population in the UK Biobank is predominantly of European descent. While the validation cohorts included American and Chinese participants, the results may not apply perfectly to every global population. The researchers attempted to adjust for lifestyle factors like smoking and exercise. However, residual factors could still influence the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research is necessary to confirm these findings. The authors suggest that randomized controlled trials are the next logical step. Such trials would assign participants to specific diets and monitor their health over time. This would provide more definitive evidence of the biological pathways involved. Researchers should also investigate how these dietary changes affect brain health at different stages of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides a detailed roadmap of how food impacts the brain. It highlights the MIND diet as a promising strategy for reducing the burden of neurological and psychiatric disorders. It also identifies ultra-processed foods as a significant modifiable risk factor. The findings offer potential targets for future medical interventions and public health guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2025.103616" target="_blank"&gt;Association between different dietary patterns and the risk of major brain disorders: a prospective multi-cohort study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Yisen Shi, Yixiang Lin, Yiling Zheng, Xinxi Yu, Binfan Ou, Kaitai Yang, Fabin Lin, Xinyang Zou, Jiayi Zheng, Ruitian Zeng, Xuan Lin, Qinyong Ye, Lina Chen, Yuqi Zeng, and Guoen Cai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:01:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxOV3hmNzZkc2ExVVBaVy1PSE5GSm4zUmt3R3ZxZktvamF6c1dESnJvdUZRZ3c1a08ybGdHNDdtSkRVWWEyaXFydDlPUVJUZkltdGpiTDJnYVkxZktWM0F3ZUk5TW51eTBNZnd5cFBXUS1LZ3NyNDFNdVJ3WXdWU2lIZHJQUGZyUFF0bXNNUA</guid></item><item><title>一半的GLP-1用户放弃注射—有些人正在转向其他减肥方法- MarketWatch</title><link>https://www.marketwatch.com/story/half-of-glp-1-users-ditch-their-injections-and-some-are-turning-to-other-weight-loss-methods-instead-8effac61</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MarketWatch</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2wFBVV95cUxQZnVYMWx3eVJZT0RJSFFPQjNsVXlvdGtjYWVMYU8tN05GV0xfTm55bHU0SWpzdjFwb0xHTW9xZ01jSG83aktvLXdTRDItNUFmVlhZNGlwT3o0S05BVlJKUWVJUXNGZGR4N1BUdjFCb2tWc3NybVo2YjhYQXpfbm43WmdqaG1MZTRzT21MMk5JSlRTU2E3UjFQZV9xZWc4MHlCcVAtbTdVN3cxT0VMOThYckZabmMtWXNoRGV4ejZOOTg3dmlyakppSDQ5MS1CYkhweDVkc3lrRjV2Y1E</guid></item><item><title>克利夫兰诊所为主校区寻求1级创伤中心- Cleveland.com</title><link>https://www.cleveland.com/news/2026/01/cleveland-clinic-level-1-trauma-center-plan-draws-swift-criticism-from-metrohealth.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HUGPK5R6N5FYTH4PQYQMUXHH2U"&gt;CLEVELAND, Ohio — The Cleveland Clinic announced plans Thursday to establish a Level I trauma center at its main campus in Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="T5BXSRN5TRETPJ6W2UPHWQS7QA"&gt;The Clinic said it is pursuing accreditation for the Level 1 trauma center that would serve both adults and children.

It is especially important to help those who have not been vaccinated, including newborns, or cannot receive vaccines, infectious diseases experts say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Herd immunity was a key component in how measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 -- a status that is now under threat.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The authors noted there are some limitations including that the risk levels are estimates, risk levels are individual, and that vaccination rates include children who are not eligible for the vaccine, particularly those under 1 year old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But they add that the estimates may help the general public, as well as public health officials, make informed choices about vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"Hopefully [this] will help provide more up-to-date information, more localized information, for not only the public, but also the government agencies to make the best decisions that work for everyone," Zhou said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:06:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPc09PQl9EQlhHOS1fSW04OGVfemVIYzFKS0lnclgtYUFMNS1JREdTNW9hVk5yMkZyaVBxY0VKZUNYRWJMNVJ5SXZBY2ZTNXAxeFhkdGM0RGpEQzg0UzVyb29ZTnE2Yl9wYWFCbWlXcExsZ3ZqUkd0ZEZCdnNDYVAyMkNFbUdZVU1FS3M0bWNnMWs5alRI0gGaAUFVX3lxTFBQWHA0d2NtR2tPVDR5bTQzdzY5NS1IQkRtVXpqM251MXZKQ0hRcEI0LWVWdkdNWlVkYWNFSGFnUFVMM2NVeUFNaWFxcTFCOUZkT0R0VUwtRldSQnpnU2lEZlpmQy1IRXJwWGFQZFNidVNWclIwNEdlWEoxMF9LRkpFNkxmS3BORmkxeE9CWXdGMUdYZVBRaF9IN2c</guid></item><item><title>美国关于非洲乙型肝炎疫苗的有争议的研究被取消-卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/hepatitis-b-vaccines-study-africa-cancel</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The controversial US-funded study on hepatitis B vaccines among newborns in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/guinea-bissau" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Guinea-Bissau&lt;/a&gt; has been halted, according to Yap Boum, a senior official at the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The study has been cancelled,” Boum told journalists at a press conference on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The $1.6m study, funded under the purview of Robert F Kennedy Jr, longtime vaccine skeptic and secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) , drew outrage and criticism over ethical questions about withholding vaccines proven to prevent hepatitis B in a country with a very high burden of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s of importance for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; CDC to have evidence that can be translated in policy, but this has to be done within the norm. So we are glad that at this point the study is being cancelled,” Boum said. The study was halted because it raised critical questions on the ethics of the trial, he said, adding: “The way the study was designed was a big challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Officials in Guinea-Bissau say the trial will still happen, according to one journalist on the press call. But Africa CDC officials said the trial would only move forward once it has been redesigned to address ethical issues. There were “still some conversations happening” between Guinea-Bissau officials and the US on how to conduct a trial like this ethically, and Africa CDC had assembled a team to make sure Guinea-Bissau officials “receive the adequate support to ensure that this study, if it has to happen, will also fit the ethical regulations”, Boum said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Guinea-Bissau, which underwent a coup in November, appears to have replaced all top officials, including at the ministry of health. Previous officials did not respond to media inquiries, and the number and email address for the health ministry appear to be disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The good guys won,” said Paul Offit, an infectious diseases physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a former member of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The cancellation news was “extremely heartening”, he said, adding that except for the birth of his children, he had “never been happier”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This administration did not see people in Africa as valuable,” Offit said. “You can’t treat children like this, you can’t treat people like this. We were able to stand up for them. We were able to convince people about the fact that this was unethical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The HHS did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiries about why the trial was cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The news could represent a turning point for Guinea-Bissau and other countries where researchers are conducting work that critics say is unethical. It shows that “the institutions are getting stronger” by pushing back on unethical and exploitative studies in Africa, said Boghuma Titanji, an assistant professor of medicine at Emory University who is currently studying vaccine misinformation in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The halt was “a win for advocacy and upholding the ethics of research”, said Titanji, who called the trial as it seems to be designed a “damaging” study. “It can lead to damage that lasts for several decades after the study has been completed,” said Titanji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that the trial would make the vaccine available to 7,000 newborns when they would “not otherwise receive it”. But that means the other 7,000 children in the trial wouldn’t have access to the vaccine “due to the flip of a coin”, which would “knowingly deprive 7,000 children of a vaccine that could save their lives”, Offit said. Instead, he said, “take the $1.6m and vaccinate as many children as you can at birth”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;About 18% of adults and about 11% of children under the age of one in Guinea-Bissau have hepatitis B. Children are much more likely to develop long-term effects, such as liver cirrhosis that can lead to cancer and death, if they catch the virus when they are very young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Guinea-Bissau currently recommends the hepatitis B vaccine to all babies at six weeks of age because of issues accessing the vaccine, but that recommendation will change to all newborns at birth in 2027 when more doses roll out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Offit likened the trial to the Tuskegee experiment, in which US researchers knowingly withheld an effective antibiotic from African American men suffering from syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Danish researchers conducting the trial have also been criticized for not publishing the results of a study on the DTP vaccine, potentially because it contradicted their belief that the vaccine is dangerous, &lt;a href="https://www.weekendavisen.dk/samfund/et-daarligt-immunforsvar" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Danish journalist Gunver Lystbæk Vestergård.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The protocols for the study have not been made public by the researchers or health officials, but a leaked version was published by &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/scoop-the-leaked-protocol-of-the" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Inside Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Frederik Schaltz-Buchholzer, one of the Danish researchers, also shared some &lt;a href="https://substack.com/@frederikschaltzbuchholzer/note/c-198070651?" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; on social media. Titanji didn’t find his argument compelling. “It actually just raises even more concerns in my mind,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers argue that live vaccines may bring nonspecific effects – improving overall health, not just against the disease the vaccine is targeting. But, they say, adding an attenuated vaccine like hepatitis B could interfere with these possible effects. Yet the evidence to support possible overall health effects is based upon the researchers’ prior research, which has been called into question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other Danish researchers analyzed these studies and found no statistically significant effects, according to their new &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.31.25343212v1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;preprint study&lt;/a&gt;, which has not been peer-reviewed or published yet. One of the researchers on that study, Anders Hviid, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/prof-anders-hviid_p%C3%A5stande-om-vacciners-skjulte-effekter-share-7417091616009736192-pFPy/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on LinkedIn that these findings were especially important given recent decisions in the US to limit several vaccines for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Danish researchers also argued that trials should be done in Africa in order to study their effects on African children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Titanji agreed that there needed to be more randomized controlled trials done in Africa on Africans, but said that they should be led by African scientists and powered by questions from Africans. Projects like the Danish study “basically exploit the scarcity of a proven beneficial vaccine in a context where that vaccine is needed”, Titanji said. The study, as it is currently designed, would be “exploiting a window where the government is not able to provide that intervention to its citizens”, Titanji said. “You are not solving the problem. You’re actually being part of the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The trial was slated to begin on 5 January. When reached last week about whether the trial had begun, the lead researchers, Peter Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn, disputed the Guardian’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/19/hepatitis-b-vaccine-study-guinea-bissau-rfk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;previous story&lt;/a&gt; that cited ethical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“That article was totally wrong,” Aaby said. “The report had virtually no evidence-based content about vaccines to transmit to the readers, only a lot of ethical condemnations from those who might potentially be questioned by the future results of the study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aaby and other researchers on the project did not respond to further inquiries about the project’s cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aaby and Stabell Benn, who are Danish researchers, have close ties with Trump administration health officials. Stabell Benn hosted a &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/vaccine-curious/id1629371129" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; with Tracy Beth Høeg, now an FDA official who has worked to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/31/tracy-beth-hoeg-fda-vaccines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;find deaths after Covid vaccination&lt;/a&gt; and advocated for the US to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/05/trump-rfk-jr-child-vaccine-recommendations" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;slash vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt; to align with Denmark’s schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On Joe Rogan’s &lt;a href="https://podscripts.co/podcasts/the-joe-rogan-experience/1999-robert-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 Kennedy praised Aaby as a “very famous” researcher whose work showed the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine was deadly, he said – research Kennedy also cited when he ended funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. But he didn’t mention that the year before, in 2022, the researchers found completely different results when they conducted the same trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQeGVoY2dfS1hNcVJSWms5WWxwdmk5TWpCVWJpcmR5emVRc3ZJQ1RRdWo3Nk5FVFllWmZ1N016akl0b3dHWU9hNExHUTlFY2E3NFJSZlQ3THZPdUFBVk1ZUjVVZHJWdXJKckFDU1lya0ktUW1jUFJIdWk3bGNmVmthQnJSZGI3VldUSWZQbWQxemxOZw</guid></item><item><title>哈佛培训的胃肠病学家AIIMS揭示了“1种生活方式习惯” ，可以在不改变饮食的情况下降低血糖|健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/aiims-harvard-trained-gastroenterologist-reveals-1-lifestyle-habit-that-lowers-blood-sugar-without-changing-your-diet-101768488254944.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="artContent"&gt;&lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt;&lt;p class="content"&gt;Managing blood sugar can feel overwhelming, especially with all the diet restrictions, calorie counting, and constant monitoring.

In 2024, however, it was ready, and the system has done a large push through both 2024 and 2025 to educate families about RSV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we know something's going to work, and we have the science behind it, what can we do to jump on it and try to do it as quickly as we can?" Reynolds said. "And I would say, within the last two seasons, we've been able to show that we can make an impact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermountain Health is encouraging vaccinations in three different ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pregnant women can be immunized in their third trimester with the maternal RSV protection Abrysvo, passing immunity to their babies within two weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Babies born during the RSV season can be immunized in the form of Nirsevimab monoclonal antibodies shortly after they are born, giving immunity within a few days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Families of infants born between April and September, outside of RSV season, are invited to bring them to their pediatrician for a vaccination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you haven't heard from your pediatrician and you want (an RSV vaccine), call your pediatrician, and they can get you in and get that injection," Reynolds said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine effectiveness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV is particularly hard for infants because it causes bronchiolitis, making it very difficult to breathe and eat. Reynolds said a bad case of RSV can disrupt infants' development and cause ongoing troubles with breastfeeding for some babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our moms know what RSV is like, and we all are scared of it. None of us, none of us wants a baby who's sick. ... Because we know RSV, I think we've been more willing to do something to prevent it," Reynolds said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the vaccine, 1 in every 48 infants in their first year of life will be hospitalized with RSV in Utah, and 1 in every 200 needs intensive care, Reynolds said an Intermountain Health study shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for infants who are immunized, only 1 in every 400 is hospitalized, and 1 in every 1,000 ends up in the ICU, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reynolds said national studies show the RSV vaccine is safe and effective, and parents can also look at &lt;a href="https://news.intermountainhealth.org/colorado-montana-and-utah-among-nations-top-states-in-rsv-protection-for-babies-following-intermountain-health-awareness-effort/#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20Intermountain%20Children's%20Health%20gathered,It%20found%3A&amp;amp;text=16%2C000%20Utah%20Intermountain%20infant%20patients,expectant%20mothers%20received%20RSV%20protection." rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Intermountain Health's data&lt;/a&gt; showing it has made "a huge difference to us in our community."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ability to keep babies well and out of the hospital with a single shot is a game-changer," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cities have long equated brightness with safety. From &lt;strong&gt;sodium vapour lamps&lt;/strong&gt; to high-efficiency&lt;strong&gt; LEDs&lt;/strong&gt;, the evolution of urban lighting has focused on clarity, coverage and control. The aim has been uniform: eliminate dark corners, extend activity into the night, reduce risk. Little attention was given to what this illumination displaces or disrupts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is beginning to change. Subtle shifts in how streets are lit, where lights are placed and which wavelengths are used are prompting a quiet reappraisal of standard practice. This change is not driven by aesthetics or cost alone. In some areas, it begins with a question that conventional planning rarely posed: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;what does light erase&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the outskirts of Copenhagen, one municipality is adjusting its streetlighting system in a way that departs from decades of urban convention. The solution looks minor.&lt;strong&gt; A colour change&lt;/strong&gt;, visible mostly at night, only on certain streets. But the reasons behind the shift reflect a broader convergence of biodiversity policy, climate targets and infrastructure design.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than dimming its lights entirely, &lt;strong&gt;Gladsaxe&lt;/strong&gt; is trying something more precise. &lt;strong&gt;A red light&lt;/strong&gt;. Not symbolic, but spectral. Not decorative, but calculated to reduce disruption to the natural systems that cities have often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Red-Spectrum Lighting Introduced to Protect Nocturnal Species&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Gladsaxe, local authorities have installed &lt;strong&gt;red LED streetlights&lt;/strong&gt; along a stretch of road identified as a habitat for &lt;strong&gt;seven bat species&lt;/strong&gt;. While none of these are currently listed as endangered, research cited by the municipality indicates that at least two—&lt;strong&gt;the common pipistrelle&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;the brown long-eared bat&lt;/strong&gt;—are especially susceptible to behavioural changes caused by artificial light.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lighting system was implemented along &lt;strong&gt;Frederiksborgvej&lt;/strong&gt;, a tree-lined corridor near which the bat populations feed and navigate. The shift from white to red lighting followed findings that &lt;strong&gt;short-wavelength light&lt;/strong&gt; can significantly alter bat activity, while red-spectrum light is less likely to interfere with their echolocation and feeding patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Municipal traffic engineer Jonas Jørgensen described the red lighting as the best available option in areas where full darkness was not feasible. His statement, included in the municipality’s &lt;a href="https://via.ritzau.dk/pressemeddelelse/13638658/ny-vejbelysning-i-gladsaxe-udviklet-til-flagermus?publisherId=13559514" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;official press release&lt;/a&gt;, highlighted the balancing act between ecological sensitivity and basic safety requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The project is part of the &lt;strong&gt;Lighting Metropolis – Green Mobility&lt;/strong&gt; programme, an EU-supported initiative involving several cities in Denmark and Sweden. In collaboration with design firm &lt;strong&gt;Light Bureau&lt;/strong&gt;, the municipality tailored the lighting configuration to reduce ecological impact without removing functionality. Warm white light remains in areas with significant pedestrian or vehicular traffic. Red light is used only where disruption to wildlife is likely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Light Pollution and Infrastructure-Linked Habitat Disruption&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The changes reflect growing recognition that &lt;strong&gt;artificial night-time lighting&lt;/strong&gt; is a form of environmental disturbance. Studies over the past decade have &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/12/amazon-giant-anaconda-discovery-will-smith-tv-series/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="111568" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;identified multiple species&lt;/a&gt;—birds, insects, amphibians and marine life—whose reproductive, migratory or feeding behaviours are altered by artificial illumination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bats, in particular, have been a focal point due to their sensitivity to light and proximity to urban areas. Findings from a &lt;strong&gt;technical report prepared for the Danish Road Directorate&lt;/strong&gt; underscore how road lighting can affect bat behaviour and survival, especially when installed close to feeding corridors or roosting areas.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gladsaxe-replaced-white-streetlights-with-red-LEDs-to-reduce-disruption-to-local-bat-species-while-maintaining-road-safety.jpg.webp" alt="Blur,street,crossing" class="wp-image-117180" srcset="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gladsaxe-replaced-white-streetlights-with-red-LEDs-to-reduce-disruption-to-local-bat-species-while-maintaining-road-safety.jpg.webp 1000w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gladsaxe-replaced-white-streetlights-with-red-LEDs-to-reduce-disruption-to-local-bat-species-while-maintaining-road-safety-420x280.jpg.webp 420w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gladsaxe-replaced-white-streetlights-with-red-LEDs-to-reduce-disruption-to-local-bat-species-while-maintaining-road-safety-520x347.jpg.webp 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gladsaxe replaced white streetlights with red LEDs to reduce disruption to local bat species while maintaining road safety. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This type of intervention aligns with efforts to meet the &lt;strong&gt;United Nations Sustainable Development Goals&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals#sustainable-cities-and-communities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Goal 11 (sustainable cities)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals#climate-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Goal 13 (climate action)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals#life-on-land" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Goal 15 (life on land)&lt;/a&gt;. Gladsaxe has formally adopted these goals into its municipal development strategy, making it the first “SDG Municipality” in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Energy Performance and Emissions Alignment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The adoption of &lt;strong&gt;red-spectrum LEDs&lt;/strong&gt; also brings energy and maintenance benefits. Compared to legacy sodium lamps or halogen systems, LEDs require less power, last longer and support &lt;strong&gt;smart lighting controls&lt;/strong&gt;, including dimming and motion sensing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The municipality is in the process of replacing approximately &lt;strong&gt;5,000 fixtures&lt;/strong&gt;, with funding and technical support through the &lt;strong&gt;Lighting Metropolis&lt;/strong&gt; programme. Across participating cities, over &lt;strong&gt;50,000 luminaires&lt;/strong&gt; are being upgraded to more efficient systems, reducing operational costs and aligning with broader emissions targets.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Red-LED-systems-cut-energy-use-and-support-climate-goals-through-smart-low-emission-public-infrastructure.jpg.webp" alt="Background,red,carpet,light,neon,bright,light.,street,with,red" class="wp-image-117183" srcset="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Red-LED-systems-cut-energy-use-and-support-climate-goals-through-smart-low-emission-public-infrastructure.jpg.webp 1000w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Red-LED-systems-cut-energy-use-and-support-climate-goals-through-smart-low-emission-public-infrastructure-420x268.jpg.webp 420w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Red-LED-systems-cut-energy-use-and-support-climate-goals-through-smart-low-emission-public-infrastructure-520x331.jpg.webp 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red LED systems cut energy use and support climate goals through smart, low-emission public infrastructure. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This transition also supports &lt;strong&gt;SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy)&lt;/strong&gt; by prioritising low-consumption public infrastructure. Beyond immediate energy savings, smart lighting networks allow municipalities to adjust output based on usage patterns, further reducing unnecessary light exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Symbolic Cues and Urban Design Language&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The choice of red lighting also functions as a &lt;strong&gt;spatial marker&lt;/strong&gt;. In public communications, officials and designers have described the red glow as a visible reminder that a given area supports ecologically sensitive species. Philip Jelvard of &lt;strong&gt;Light Bureau&lt;/strong&gt; stated in the project briefing that the colour could help make passersby aware of local habitats under protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This use of colour and tone as &lt;strong&gt;non-verbal urban cues&lt;/strong&gt; is becoming more common in infrastructure design. By signalling transitions in land use or ecological sensitivity, lighting itself becomes a layer of public information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Residents and commuters appear to have accepted the change. No visibility issues or negative feedback were reported by the municipality in the initial months following the installation. Monitoring of bat activity is ongoing, but no post-implementation behavioural data has yet been released.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the investigation was Efren Saldivar, a respiratory therapist at Glendale Adventist Medical Center. Suspected of killing patients with lethal doses of Pavulon, a powerful muscle relaxant, Saldivar confessed, then recanted, leaving police scrambling for proof. Their only hope: unearthing buried bodies and detecting traces of a drug in tissue that had decomposed for years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1999, forensic chemist Brian Andresen was called in to assist Glendale police, who had spent months trying to build a case against Saldivar without success. The scale of the alleged crimes was staggering: 171 deaths during Saldivar’s shifts, all initially ruled natural. Saldivar confessed during a polygraph interview to assisting or directly causing over 100 deaths, describing himself as an “&lt;em&gt;angel of death&lt;/em&gt;”, a term he said reminded him of a character on television. Despite the confession, no charges could be filed without hard forensic evidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Investigators then turned to the Forensic Science Center at &lt;em&gt;Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory&lt;/em&gt;, a facility often called the “&lt;em&gt;Lab of Last Resort&lt;/em&gt;,” where cutting-edge tools and techniques offered one last shot at uncovering the truth. For Andresen and his team, the challenge was immense: locate and identify chemical traces of Pavulon in corpses exhumed years after death, in conditions far from sterile.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Forensic Puzzle Beneath the Ground&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough didn’t come easily. Andresen’s team had to develop entirely new methods to extract Pavulon from decomposed human tissue. Before testing real bodies, he experimented with rotting beef and pig liver from a local Safeway to simulate the chemical conditions of buried remains. Eventually, by adapting a method used for detecting chemical &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/havana-syndrome-directed-energy-weapons-and-contactless-warfare-of-future/" data-type="post" data-id="63071"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, solid phase extraction through syringelike cartridges, they succeeded in isolating the drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to&lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a69960995/angel-of-death-lawrence-livermore-lab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Popular Mechanics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, each exhumed body was reduced to a slurry and analyzed via mass spectrometry, a technology Andresen had worked with since the Apollo missions. More than 240 samples were tested, with most yielding no results. But one sample gave a positive reading, then another, and another. In total, six victims were confirmed to have lethal levels of Pavulon in their system, enough to finally move forward with charges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These included 77-year-old &lt;em&gt;Eleanora Schlegel&lt;/em&gt;, who had been admitted with pneumonia just days before her sudden death, and &lt;em&gt;Jose Alfaro&lt;/em&gt;, an 82-year-old WWII veteran who had no prior treatment involving Pavulon. For each case, the presence of the drug, normally used to facilitate breathing treatment, was medically unjustified and fatal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Building the Death Board&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With no obvious leads and a suspect who had withdrawn his confession, Glendale police were left to reconstruct the puzzle patient by patient. Detective Will Currie and Sergeant John McKillop spent more than a year reviewing hospital records to identify suspicious deaths. They looked for signs of patients being administered Pavulon without medical cause and cross-referenced those cases with Saldivar’s shifts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the same report, the investigative team created a “&lt;em&gt;death board&lt;/em&gt;,” a visual map of potential victims, posted on the walls of their office. As they narrowed the list from 171 deaths to 20, they began the painstaking process of exhuming one body per week over several months. Each time, samples were hand-delivered by McKillop and Currie to the lab, ensuring an unbroken chain of custody.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The emotional toll was real. McKillop described recurring nightmares and a deep frustration with the idea that most of Saldivar’s victims might never be formally identified. “&lt;em&gt;By his own confession, it’s probably 100-plus&lt;/em&gt;,” said McKillop, “&lt;em&gt;but we’ll never be able to prove it&lt;/em&gt;”,  he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Turning Science Into Justice&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the Pavulon traces were confirmed, prosecutors had what they needed. Saldivar was indicted in October 2001 on six counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. He confessed again and pled guilty in March 2002. That confession alone wouldn’t have been enough to secure a conviction, as police initially lacked physical proof, what law enforcement refers to as &lt;em&gt;corpus delicti&lt;/em&gt;, the body of the crime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to retired Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley, the &lt;em&gt;Livermore lab&lt;/em&gt; was essential to the case. Without the forensic evidence extracted by Andresen’s team, Saldivar’s statements would have been inadmissible in court. “&lt;em&gt;Livermore lab was the key&lt;/em&gt;,” Cooley said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, the Forensic Science Center continues its work under new leadership, focusing on chemical and radiological threats on a national scale. Andresen, now retired, still consults on rare cases. And while the lab’s capabilities have advanced dramatically, the Angel of Death case remains one of its most defining moments.&lt;/p&gt;

Doctors had told his family that, despite his age, his brain showed degeneration comparable to that of a 70-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to SWNS, Yarham, from Dereham in Norfolk, was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) a month before his 23rd birthday. Caused by a protein mutation, FTD is a rare form of dementia that typically affects people aged between 45 and 65, though in rare cases it can strike much younger patients. Unlike Alzheimer’s, which usually impacts memory first, FTD often presents through changes in personality and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Study: Physical and mental activities help to reduce risk of dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition affects around &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/news/frontotemporal-dementia-ftd-what-is-it-and-how-close-is-a-cure/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;one in 30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;people with dementia in the UK and is exceptionally rare in young adults. Yarham’s family first noticed changes in 2022, when he began moving and speaking more slowly, became increasingly forgetful, and at times appeared blank or unresponsive during conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

A consultant later told the family that the scan showed his brain resembled that of someone decades older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fewer than 0.1 per cent of people in the UK are diagnosed with any form of dementia before the age of 65, placing Yarham among a vanishingly small group of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the diagnosis, his condition deteriorated quickly. His mother, Sam, became his full-time carer, helping him eat, dress and bathe as his speech faded and his mobility declined. “Andre got his official diagnosis just before his 23rd birthday,” she said. “In that time his speech went totally. He was just making noises. The last six months was when we started to see a very rapid decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late summer, he was struggling to feed himself or hold a cup and had become increasingly unsteady. The family made the decision to move him into a nursing home in September. Within weeks, he required a wheelchair and hoist support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before his illness, Yarham had lived what his family described as a typical young life. He played rugby and football at school, followed wrestling closely and spent time gaming with friends on titles such as FIFA and Call of Duty. He also worked briefly at Lotus Cars in Norwich, replacing car headliners, but left after six months because he was struggling to get through the working day and could not explain why something felt wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

(via Samantha Fairbairn / SWNS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, he was admitted to hospital with an infection. His mother later described this as the point at which his decline accelerated sharply, with her son becoming less aware of his surroundings. After three weeks in hospital, he was moved to Priscilla Bacon Lodge Hospice, where he was placed on end-of-life care. He died on 27 December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his death, the family donated his brain to medical research in the hope that it could help others. “We made the decision to donate Andre’s brain to medical research,” his mother said. “If in the future, if Andre has been able to help just one more family have a precious few more years with a loved one, that would mean the absolute world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case has drawn renewed attention to the difficulty of recognising dementia in younger patients and the speed with which rare forms such as frontotemporal dementia can progress. Yarham’s family said the diagnosis and its aftermath had been devastating for them all, including his father Alastair and his brother Tyler, but they hope that greater awareness may encourage others to seek help earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of his life, Sam urged families not to dismiss early warning signs because of age. “If people do have concerns about loved ones and their memories, there are tests available and go to your GP,” she said, adding thanks to those who supported the family throughout her son’s illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Early symptoms of dementia (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2023/12/nhs-urges-people-to-spot-dementia-warning-signs-in-loved-ones-this-christmas/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="strong" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;according to NHS England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; Emotional changes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Forgetfulness&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Difficulty concentrating&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Struggling to follow a conversation or find the right word&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Being confused about time and places&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Symptoms of frontotemporal dementia (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/frontotemporal-dementia/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="strong" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;according to the NHS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; personality and behaviour changes, such as acting inappropriately or impulsively, appearing selfish or unsympathetic, neglecting personal hygiene, overeating, or loss of motivation&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; language problems, including speaking slowly, struggling to make the right sounds when saying a word, getting words in the wrong order, or using words incorrectly&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; problems with mental abilities, such as getting distracted easily, struggling with planning and organisation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 12:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxPdjg1NlRta0paMWRsQzY5RlFhRDNjZFRfVC1YR1NmQkhNaTQ0QUMySk8wZmJVSGpaV3NUMnhfSXdxSGlaSS1fMHpwT2xlSTVmXzIyYjN0dlR0ekExYjBNX2gybmQ5aGxCbjlvVmFianNic05aMjM2LTNKX0VoYXkxLUVoUlgtc3JqNkhYNHRFNS1lQm9RdzNQT3BRbzRnNDM3cEVRSjJUTURCZ2FxYWZXWG56RlA4SGwyN1VwX1ZZRExVNUc4a1gzeEhEUVB0cGphU2gtUU9nSndzbVVkLXhfVHNrZTZ4SnFRenpQTnVTUldwTV9mTjVR</guid></item><item><title>抑郁症的大脑治疗被证明是有帮助的- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/15/health/saint-tms-depression-therapy-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Summer passed Valerie Zeko by when she was 27, as she vegged out on the couch watching TV instead of seeing friends or exploring the overcast beach near her house. She later learned that period was her first &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/depression-types-brain-treatments-study-wellness"&gt;episode of depression&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl001y3b6p9iyu02xu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I felt like the fog was in my head as well as outside,” said Zeko, now 57, describing the mood disorder that would squelch her happiness, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/27/health/procrastination-how-to-stop-adhd-depression-wellness"&gt;motivation and self-esteem&lt;/a&gt; for 28 years until she finally found effective treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl001z3b6p8uha9vd9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Everything in my life appeared to be perfect and wonderful, but my head was full of this really bad, negative self-talk constantly,” Zeko told CNN. “I felt like my whole life was falling apart around me. I couldn’t get things done in my house.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl00203b6p98pj9x5i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When Zeko first sought help in 2011, her doctor prescribed the antidepressant bupropion, which Zeko took on and off for several years. It made her feel more energized, but sometimes that boost morphed into anxiety. Then Zeko and a psychiatrist tried to tackle her mood disorder with a series of seven other antidepressants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl00213b6pyin9oe67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They just either didn’t work at all, made it worse, made me feel suicidal,” she said. Other “horrible” side effects included urinary issues, headaches, nightmares, emotional numbness and fatigue, Zeko said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl00223b6prp856m9c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Zeko’s predicament fit what experts call &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/19/health/vagus-nerve-stimulation-depression-treatment-wellness"&gt;treatment-resistant depression&lt;/a&gt;, which isn’t a formal diagnosis separate from major depressive disorder. Instead, experts may use the term, or TRD for short, to characterize depression unimproved by one or more validated, conventional treatments for depression, said psychiatrist Dr. Brandon Bentzley, cofounder and chief scientific officer of Magnus Medical, a neurotechnology company. &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/mood-disorders/treatment-resistant-depression" target="_blank"&gt;Nearly one-third&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression" target="_blank"&gt;332 million people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide with depression fall into the treatment-resistant category.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl00233b6pymr8909w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The year 2023 was when Zeko’s depression “was really bad, when I was desperate,” she said. Though Zeko never contemplated taking her own life, she began to understand why two acquaintances who had &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/10/health/suicide-why-you-shouldnt-say-committed-wellness"&gt;died by suicide&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/10/health/suicide-myths-facts-prevention-wellness"&gt;considered that an option&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl00243b6plp4b8f3t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then a friend recommended that Zeko sign up for a randomized controlled clinical trial testing an innovative, five-day therapy for treatment-resistant depression at Stanford University’s &lt;a href="https://bsl.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brain Stimulation Lab&lt;/a&gt; in California. Called SAINT, for &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-treatments/s/stanford-accelerated-intelligent-neuromodulation-therapy.html" target="_blank"&gt;Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, the treatment sends quick magnetic pulses to a targeted region in a patient’s prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is a core region for emotional and cognitive processing and regulation; its dysfunction is thought to be a key aspect of what causes depression.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl00253b6pf1wfh7r2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Within just the first week or so of receiving SAINT in November 2023, Zeko’s ability to enjoy life — the lack of which is a hallmark &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/17/health/clinical-depression-explainer-wellness"&gt;symptom of depression&lt;/a&gt; — significantly improved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl00263b6p7ys2fv45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Just a few days later, my whole family had Thanksgiving in San Francisco, and we rented e-bikes and rode our bikes across the Golden Gate Bridge,” Zeko said. “I had done this before and never enjoyed it. I was always like, ‘Oh, my butt hurts, it’s freezing, it’s loud, I can’t wait for this to be over.’
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl00273b6pxgb20x2x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This time, it was a whole different experience,” Zeko added. “I was like, ‘I want to do everything that I have always done again, because it’s so much better now.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkekn2mx000x3b6pcbpfyoq8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Zeko wasn’t the only participant who benefited from the trial, the results of which are&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.70032" target="_blank"&gt; detailed in a study&lt;/a&gt; published today in the journal World Psychiatry. Half of the 24 participants in the treatment group achieved remission by one month after undergoing SAINT, compared with nearly 21% of the 24 people in the placebo treatment group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkest82o002c3b6puenrge1y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have brought mental health treatment into the same precision medicine as the rest of medicine itself,” said Bentzley, a lead developer of SAINT and a lead author of the therapy’s first randomized controlled trial, which was &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.20101429" target="_blank"&gt;published in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Bentzley’s company, Magnus Medical, holds the SAINT license.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkest82o002d3b6poxzd2tq3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We do have the tools to … actually understand the human brain on an individual basis, take that knowledge and apply it to treatments in the same way that a cardiologist or cardiothoracic surgeon would on the heart,” Bentzley added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesp0ct002a3b6phzu0ovev@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Typically, the more treatments someone with persistent depression has tried, the less likely the next therapeutic will work for them, which can deepen feelings of hopelessness, said Dr. Ian Kratter, lead author of the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Potentially showing a treatment can help people even in those circumstances is an incredibly powerful message for patients who are suffering,” added Kratter, clinical assistant professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesyeig002t3b6p40ejxiyh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most major mental health treatments — such as some antidepressants or electroconvulsive therapy — were accidentally discovered when initially being used for other diseases, particularly the bacterial infection tuberculosis, Bentzley said. In contrast, formulating SAINT involved “a true engineering process around how the brain worked,” he added.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesyeig002u3b6pyijooci6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We started that process in the early 2010s,” Bentzley said. The team Bentzley is referring to was led by neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/12/nolan-williams-obituary.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nolan Williams&lt;/a&gt;, who died by suicide in October at age 43. Williams started Stanford’s Brain Stimulation Lab, the eventual hub for SAINT, in 2015. He had experienced depression himself and never underwent his own therapy, Bentzley said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesyeig002v3b6pynykeyg9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Nolan was an amazing scientist, but he was a healer before being a scientist. That was by far and away more important to him,” Kratter said. “He wanted to get people better faster.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesyeig002w3b6paib5vxe8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The team explored which brain area to change to get someone out of depression and back to themselves noninvasively with minimal to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/21/health/antidepressants-sexual-side-effects-tips-wellness"&gt;no side effects&lt;/a&gt;, Bentzley said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesyd6m002q3b6pv4osxok0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The SAINT technology first obtains a structural and functional MRI of the brain, with the latter providing a window into how different parts are communicating with each other, Bentzley and Kratter explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesyu2v002z3b6p8rzrrbsu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The MRI helps identify the location of the strongest connection between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and a deeper subregion, the subgenual cingulate, which is associated with depression, Kratter said. The researchers then send thousands of rapid signals, or pulses, to that location through the electromagnetic coil inside the stimulator on the participant’s scalp, Bentzley said. These signals cause the connections to become stronger, thus treating depression.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesz0c300323b6pvaviktog@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This process is administered in ten 10-minute sessions per day for five consecutive days, which is faster than conventional transcranial magnetic stimulation that’s also less precise. Conventional TMS can take two to three hour-long treatments weekly for four to six weeks, said Dr. Nina Kraguljac, chair of the American Psychiatric Association’s council on research. Kraguljac, who wasn’t involved in the study, added that the schedule may be difficult for clinics that are understaffed or only running during business hours, but more convenient for patients taking time away from other responsibilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeszpyl00373b6pv512hp5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While SAINT is administered, some patients feel nothing whereas others feel slight discomfort or pain. “It felt like my whole brain was a rubber band and they were pulling it back and then letting it go, and it would snap back,” Zeko said. “The snaps were very painful but so short that it was not a problem.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeszoi400353b6poqitctqh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest clinical trial adds to several years’ worth of scientific support for SAINT.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket0n4q003f3b6p1rrdqz1w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.19070720" target="_blank"&gt;SAINT’s second clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;, which had 21 participants but no control group, 90.5% of participants went into remission, Bentzley said. That paved the way for SAINT’s &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.20101429" target="_blank"&gt;first randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; that was also double blinded, meaning neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was receiving which treatment. The placebo treatment replicates every aspect of SAINT except for the magnetic field fully entering the patient’s brain, Bentzley explained. Instead, only a small part enters.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket0lco003d3b6peic3lz0k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf22/K220177.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;cleared SAINT as a therapy&lt;/a&gt; for treatment-resistant depression in September 2022 — making it the first rapid, noninvasive neuromodulation system for treatment-resistant depression. The therapeutic is currently available at 17 clinics in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket1b7y003k3b6pb6afskp7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re looking to hopefully double that by the end of 2026,” Bentzley said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket1b7y003l3b6ped1c0nia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study replicated previous results but in a larger population, Kratter said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket1b7y003m3b6pai67z3gy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think the study is going to be a landmark study in terms of how we think about mechanisms in TMS and how we can personalize treatments using biological markers in the brain,” said Kraguljac, who is also executive vice chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral health at the Ohio State University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket1b7y003n3b6pnks8zocw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study also more objectively measured SAINT’s potential effects on the brain by conducting electroencephalograms, or EEGs, before and after the trial. Those tests involve placing small electrodes on the scalp to record electrical activity in the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket1b7y003o3b6p0h6l24vh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The EEGs found SAINT “had a very interesting effect” on beta brain waves, Kratter said —relatively high-frequency brain waves associated with focus, decision-making and concentration. Overactivity in beta waves has &lt;a href="https://www.neuroregulation.org/article/view/23374" target="_blank"&gt;been linked &lt;/a&gt; to depression and anxiety.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket1b7y003p3b6pxhjx92sh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The treatment decreased beta power specifically in “the left anterior cingulate cortex, which is known to be important in emotion and mood regulation,” Kratter said. “The more someone got better, the greater the reduction in the beta range on EEG.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket1b7y003q3b6pg72z5jhr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, participants with more beta power in that region pre-treatment were more likely to improve, Kratter said. If these findings are replicated, EEG measures may help predict optimal participants and times for the treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket19nk003i3b6p257bgytk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I feel like I’ve walked out of a dense fog,” Zeko said. “Clarity and peace are the main things I feel in my brain now. There’s not a constant negative chatter in my brain anymore.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez003v3b6p8bft8rj4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thoughts about sad events stopped causing days-long spirals, and tasks that once felt insurmountable were no longer a second thought. “One of the things I texted  was, ‘I came home and unpacked my suitcase immediately, and I didn’t leave it sitting there for like a month,’” said Zeko, referring to messages she sent her friends.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez003x3b6pe343qztp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though the latest trial helps explain how SAINT works for some people, “what we don’t know is infinite,” Bentzley said. “The people who don’t get better, their brains look a lot more like what we call ‘healthy controls,’ or people who don’t have depression. And that doesn’t mean that they don’t have depression.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez003y3b6p4zjvsmrd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This means the neurobiology of depression can vary from person to person, even if people have the same symptoms. If that variability truly influences how a patient will fare with different treatments, psychiatry may need to advance how depression is diagnosed and thus treated, Bentzley said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez003z3b6pvvf92yqj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The EEG findings “still should be viewed as highly preliminary,” said Dr. Paul Holtzheimer, professor of psychiatry at Dartmouth University’s Geisel School of Medicine in New Hampshire. “It could be a mechanism of SAINT or it could be a generic finding when depression improves, regardless of what improves the depression.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez00403b6poesc71w3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study population was also largely White, relatively highly educated and had few co-occurring conditions, Holtzheimer said — so how SAINT may work for more diverse groups or ones with more than one diagnosis isn’t fully clear, though this wasn’t the point of the study. Future studies comparing SAINT with conventional TMS and other depression treatments are also needed, though SAINT seems to outperform others in terms of how substantially some patients recover within a short time frame, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez00413b6paia099ar@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The 50% remission rate is notably higher than what we’ve seen in other studies,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez00423b6p61q2hosl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers also excluded patients who were acutely suicidal or who had attempted suicide in the year prior to the study, noted Dr. Holly Lisanby, founding dean and Foundation Professor of the John Shufeldt School of Medicine and Medical Engineering at Arizona State University. That exclusion for the sake of participant safety is normal in experimental trials, Lisanby, who wasn’t involved in the study, added — but suicidality is also important to consider when comparing SAINT with other treatments in the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez00443b6pwogs7bcz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What also remains to be seen is more consistent evidence of how long SAINT’s benefits will last. Remission after just one five-day course of treatment has lasted anywhere from several months to years for some participants of various trials. Others have needed a tune-up here and there to remain in remission for a year, Bentzley said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez00453b6pltvdlio0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For other folks,” he added, “it’s an uphill battle that requires a lot more than just a neurobiological treatment, but also psychological reintegration, occupational treatment and time to relearn the important aspects of how to live a life of genuine remission from depression.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez00463b6psobuk03i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Relapsing into depression isn’t an issue unique to SAINT; symptoms can still recur with conventional treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez00473b6pbrk0ntda@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The experience of Willow, who has treatment-resistant depression,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;may represent some of these unknowns. Willow participated in the latest randomized controlled trial in July 2023 but was never told whether she received SAINT or the placebo treatment. This confidentiality is standard for such studies.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2xg3003t3b6pppjqfqzg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite that lack of information, Willow thinks she underwent SAINT treatment due to how her mental health shifted during and after the trial.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004c3b6pm34jnk2p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “On the fourth morning, I walked out of the MRI to head over to the clinic, and a squirrel ran in front of me, and I truly said, ‘Hello, squirrel,’ and smiled,” recalled Willow, who asked that her full name not be used due to privacy concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004d3b6pw3taa2sv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just stopped in my tracks because smiling sometimes feels, with depression, unnatural,” added Willow, who’s 43 and based in California. “The fact that I cared about this little squirrel and thought, ‘Oh, that’s a cute thing’ — I was like, ‘Oh, my goodness, this is definitely something different.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004e3b6p6z632n71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Willow’s world felt more vibrant overall, she said, and she began to be more mindful and present with her family and her fellow soccer parents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004f3b6pkvdycn8n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The treatment “was beneficial for me for about five months, then unfortunately, I started to notice my depression returning,” Willow said. The trial researchers pulled Willow from the study and gave her another round of SAINT in February 2024, which relieved her symptoms for about six months. Since October 2024, she has managed her depression with weekly &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/28/health/ketamine-therapy-depression-wellness"&gt;ketamine treatments administered&lt;/a&gt; by a doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004g3b6ppxsdjv9v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now over two years since Zeko received SAINT, she has started feeling depressed again in the past six months, she said. But her symptoms may just be from losing her dream job and now working in a nonideal job rather than signs of a relapse, she said. She has been trying to get her insurer to cover a potential next round of SAINT but said the company denied her claim, saying she hasn’t sufficiently explored all her options. Stanford is helping her try to contest the insurer’s decision, she said.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004i3b6p0zuvmbve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kratter and Bentzley are hopeful for what the SAINT trials could mean for the broader population with treatment-resistant depression, but other hurdles remain — including awareness and insurance coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004j3b6pjrqhedt4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of the people in the US who need transcranial magnetic stimulation, only 0.7% get it, Bentzley said. “That technology has been out for nearly two decades with FDA clearance and has a mountain of evidence.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004k3b6pswa1fhc1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The SAINT therapy generally isn’t covered by most private insurance plans, but some companies are considering it or offering coverage in some states. Medicare covers SAINT in hospital-based, outpatient settings. Without insurance, one course of SAINT can cost roughly from $16,000 to over $30,000, Bentzley said. The therapy is only available through clinics &lt;a href="https://www.magnusmedical.com/find-a-provider/" target="_blank"&gt;supported by Magnus Medical&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://bsl.stanford.edu/for-patients/" target="_blank"&gt;a clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; supported by Magnus Medical or Stanford, he added. “There are numerous clinics that advertise they provide SAINT but actually do not.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004l3b6pq2vrxrqs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The hope is that brain stimulation technologies … can be moved up earlier in the so-called treatment algorithm,” said Kratter, referring to treating people with treatment-resistant depression and those who would rather do a potentially one-off treatment like SAINT instead of trying pharmaceuticals and experiencing negative side effects. But whether SAINT could also be a first-line treatment for general depression hasn’t yet been studied.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004m3b6pw6py8f2v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We all dream about a major cultural shift in how we treat this population, and the optimistic side of me wants to see that happen fast,” Bentzley said. “But historically, those types of changes take several decades.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejwq73000x26p4gqgs82lg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The United States reported a record number of measles cases in 2025, and the virus continues to spread rapidly in the new year. At least ​171 measles cases have been reported in the first two weeks of 2026, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – nearly as many as the average annual total in the 25 years since measles was declared eliminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbi00043b6pe56ez6nq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of the new cases are concentrated in areas with large ongoing outbreaks — in the upstate region of South Carolina and along the Utah-Arizona state line — but the sheer scale of those outbreaks leaves the broader public at risk, even in places that aren’t currently reporting high numbers of cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbi00053b6pxeita2uy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As measles cases grow exponentially, it becomes harder to track every exposure, said Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist. People may also be out in the community without knowing that they’re infectious, and this can lead to unknown exposures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbi00063b6pry66xvn3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dozens of public exposure locations have been identified in South Carolina over the past week, Bell said Wednesday — at schools, churches, restaurants, shops and health care settings — but the health department doesn’t always publicize all of those exposure locations unless it can share specific details about the date and time of the occurrence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbi00073b6pe3duwhvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Exposures can happen when people are visiting areas experiencing an outbreak, as happened with a North Carolina family who visited Spartanburg County, South Carolina, and when infected individuals travel, as in New Mexico, where the health department recently warned of possible measles exposure at a hotel in Albuquerque from someone visiting from South Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeyztxi00023b6s5rp73kvc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least four major international airports in the US reported measles cases or potential exposures during peak holiday travel last month, and an infectious individual traveled through major cities in the Northeast on an Amtrak train last week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbi00093b6phhmcdby1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re going to see more of those exposures” because of falling vaccination rates and greater spread, said Dr. Jesse Hackell, a retired pediatrician and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics, but “vaccinating almost completely eliminates the risk of an exposure leading to disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbi000a3b6p08swepr4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s how to prepare for a possible measles exposure and how to respond if it happens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000c3b6p74ozarbd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is one of the most contagious diseases there is, but the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is extremely effective. One dose is 93% effective against measles, and the recommended second dose bumps that protection up to 97% — and the immunity is lifelong.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000d3b6pi7whaiu9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s generally recommended that children get their first dose around 12 months to 15 months of age and the second between ages 4 and 6, but that timeline can move earlier amid outbreaks — with the first dose given as young as 6 months. Older children and adults can get vaccinated at any time, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000e3b6pgr4puenm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People who are vaccinated don’t have much to worry about, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000f3b6pq22n7cmd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you have immunity to measles, you will most likely just be directed to watch for symptoms as a precaution,” said Dr. Raynard Washington, director of the public health department in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. “The vaccine should do what it is intended to do.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000g3b6pydv2setg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people who are not vaccinated when they’re exposed to the virus, there still is a chance to benefit from the protection the vaccine provides — but quick action is required.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000h3b6pw86ufj7u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An MMR vaccine given within 72 hours of exposure to measles may offer some protection or lead to milder illness. This timeframe is often before symptoms appear.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000j3b6ppif9m3e3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People who know that they have been exposed to measles, or who are worried that they might have been exposed, should contact a health care provider.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000k3b6pwkmzi0kp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Public health experts stress that folks should call ahead, rather than just showing up to doctor’s offices, emergency rooms or other health care clinics, to keep from infecting other people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000l3b6pqtxqalos@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Due to the exposures that have occurred in multiple health care settings, we remind anyone who needs medical care and knows or suspects that they may have measles, that they must notify a health care provider before visiting a health care facility. And if they have one available, they should consider wearing a mask when seeking care, to protect others in those settings from being exposed,” Bell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000m3b6p0qisex7q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are focusing all of our efforts on containing the spread of the virus around the surveillance information that’s reported to us,” she said.

            Dr. Stuart Simko, a pediatrician with Prisma Health who practices in upstate South Carolina, has treated multiple measles patients and consulted with many others about possible cases. He says that protocols reminiscent of the early Covid-19 days — including telehealth visits, masking and asking people to wait in the car — has helped prevent spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000o3b6pdzh57ot7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We took our policies and the policies that Prisma developed for screening, and we revved that up. We took it to the next level,” he said. When his office called the state health department to report the measles cases, he said officials were happy to hear that no one else had been exposed as a result.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000p3b6p57ksycnj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The amount of work that goes into contact-tracing and figuring out who is exposed in the office and who’s had their vaccines — to me, that would be a nightmare,” Simko said. “I was really proud of our team for stepping it up and in a really fast manner and make adjustments on the fly.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Watch for symptoms and monitor change
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000r3b6ptixbsvg4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early symptoms of a measles infection may make it appear like a different respiratory illness; it often starts with a fever, cough and runny nose.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000s3b6p2dtvjt7l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The hallmark rash typically shows up a few days later, starting in the mouth and along the hairline and working its way down the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000t3b6porzyran9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is one other early indicator that someone might be sick with measles instead of a different respiratory virus: conjunctivitis, or pink eye.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000u3b6pnzupnnec@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s something that would show up even maybe before the rash,” Hackell said. “So if you see that pattern, you should definitely talk to your pediatrician.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000v3b6p1qc35nf3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no specific therapy to treat measles, so vigilance is key when monitoring and managing the symptoms, experts say, including regular check-ins with health care providers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000w3b6phaf630jx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Simko met with his measles patients every couple of days through telehealth, watching to be sure they were staying hydrated and showing signs of improvement after a week or so.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000x3b6p6ahuqhcd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most kids do OK with measles, but a few don’t, and there’s no real good way at the beginning to predict which child is going to be that way,” Hackell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000y3b6ppqh4m291@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hospitalization may be necessary if there are signs of pneumonia or encephalitis, which is swelling of the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00103b6pv6ncw36t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s important to know what is going on in your environment,” Hackell said. “I think it’s important that parents know what the vaccination rates are in their local schools.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00113b6pg3yf6nz4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An exposure in a school with a high vaccination rate is much less likely to spread than in a school with a lower vaccination rate, and small differences in coverage matter. This awareness can help parents make decisions about their own behaviors and communicate relevant information to their health care providers if concerns arise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00123b6pr1ec44lw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What you can’t plan for is the public exposures like airports, trains and things like that,” Hackell said. “What’s really critically important is that the local health department, the state health department and the CDC continue to monitor what’s going on and be very quick at announcing when there has been an outbreak.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00133b6pw0xlfhqh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The State Carolina public health department shares two updates about the measles outbreak each week, and many other state and local health departments have issued notices about possible exposures in their area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00143b6pstk7c4m1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The public health department in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, recently alerted the public that it had detected measles in the wastewater — a sign that someone with a measles infection had been present in the area even though no cases had been reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00153b6pjhhhdllb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This notification also allowed the county health department to let residents know that same-day MMR vaccination was available through the Mecklenburg County Public Health Immunization Clinic and that the mobile unit would be onsite at Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools locations through the end of the school year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00163b6pieq7f34r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Local public health is on the front line of response for this work. So if you have been exposed, or there’s a potential that there was an exposure, that is the first thing that we are responsible for doing,” Washington said. “In most cases, we’re able to directly notify individuals who were involved, and if we’re not, if there’s a situation where we’re not able to contact all those individuals, then we will send the public notice.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00183b6plhfmmpd5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unvaccinated people who have been exposed to measles should stay home and away from others for 21 days after the exposure date.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00193b6prcqfx7je@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A person who has measles can be infectious before they have any symptoms of the disease, and this quarantine period helps reduce the risk of continued spread during the incubation period.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj001a3b6p8grspzga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In South Carolina, more than 400 people are in quarantine after known exposures, and the state health department has said that a significant share of cases have resulted from those in quarantine — an indication of just how important the public health practice is to interrupting spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj001b3b6pvkhb9asx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But weeks of missed school or work and all of the associated costs can be avoided: People who have gotten both of their recommended MMR shots don’t have to quarantine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj001c3b6pzxqagtn1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vaccination is the best way for parents to have some confidence, even in the event of an exposure,” Hackell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

This could be an early sign of the various conditions causing poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though some data types and sleep stages were more accurate predictors than others, the best results were owed to bodily interrelationships and contrasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the most reliable disease predictors were physiological functions that appeared out of sync: "a brain that looks asleep but a heart that looks awake, for example – seemed to spell trouble," Mignot &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2026/01/ai-sleep-disease.html"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note several limitations, such as evolving clinical practices and patient populations in recent decades. Additionally, the data were drawn from patients referred for sleep studies, meaning a portion of the general population is underrepresented in the PSG data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite AI's controversy in realms like art, its healthcare potential is a life-saving reminder of the invaluable and scientifically awe-inspiring capabilities of AI agents. For example, future use cases can combine SleepFM with wearable sleep devices to provide real-time health monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, as large language models (LLMs) learn our lingo by relating words and text, "SleepFM is essentially learning the language of sleep," Zou &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2026/01/ai-sleep-disease.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04133-4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04133-4"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The floor curves in a circle: older kids do laps pushing their IV poles, while the younger ones trundle around on wagons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There’s a playroom in which they hold themed events – bingo nights, slime nights, candy-cart nights – to inject some fun into a space otherwise sated with illness and death. One year Janosko, who worked as a nurse, dressed up as a blow-up cow to make the kids laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The floor has its own soundtrack. There’s the ubiquitous beeping of machines: low battery alert, air in line, infusion complete. On a good day, it echoes with laughter and the chirping of little voices. Many other days there is crying, and sometimes screaming, as kids are held down to change their dressings or mediport needles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The worst are the silent days, when a patient is approaching death. It’s when you brace yourself for what follows: the wailing of parents who have lost their child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Janosko knew all these sights and sounds so intimately that last August, when she returned to the ward holding four-year-old Izzy’s hand, it felt like a homecoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;[Kids with DIPG] can’t move, they can’t talk or smile or eat … but their minds are fully intact&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Except this time, her own daughter was the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Izzy had been diagnosed with the cancer every nurse on the ninth floor fears most: diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or DIPG. There is no cure, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; is almost universally fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tumor arises in the brainstem, which controls critical functions such as breathing and heart rate. Surgery is usually impossible given the location, and the disease progresses with brutal speed with a median survival of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6075859/pdf/JCO.2017.75.9308.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;11 months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1c8515d0-09f6-4e0f-a39a-3eb8cfe844c2" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Jenn Janosko and her daughter, Izzy,  embrace on a recent afternoon at their home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Janosko took her child to their allocated room. She passed former colleagues who recognised her, some giving her hugs, others looks of pity. As she settled Izzy in, she could picture the faces of the kids she had nursed in the exact same bed, some of whom had succumbed on her watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most parents have no idea what a DIPG diagnosis means. Janosko knew exactly: she was all too aware that the standard treatment of radiation and chemotherapy ultimately does not work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The only hope for Janosko was to find a clinical trial that would offer Izzy the prospect of a few more months or years of life, or – if she dared to dream – even a glimpse of that elusive cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For the past four months, Janosko has chased that vanishingly small hope relentlessly. She has tracked down the 10 medical centers in the US offering the most promising clinical trials, calling again and again until she had to restrain herself, worried about causing irritation. Most trials had a long waiting list, while others were not a good fit for Izzy’s condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One, however, could have been a match: a clinical trial run by Izzy’s own neurosurgeon at Memorial. But a new hurdle emerged: the trial, which was ready to launch in cancer centers across the country, was abruptly called off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Politics had intervened, Janosko was told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0d39bdf3-364b-4462-bd07-b1182095690e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="element element--richLink element-richLink dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":20,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘Impossible to rebuild’: NIH scientists say Trump cuts will imperil life-saving research","elementId":"0d39bdf3-364b-4462-bd07-b1182095690e","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/07/nih-scientists-trump-cuts"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":18,"display":0,"theme":0},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Trump administration’s&lt;/a&gt; dismantling of federal agencies has hit cancer research hard. It has led to budgets being slashed, grants canceled or delayed, while clinical trials – often the final hope for children with terminal illness – have been suspended or closed. Laboratories have imposed a hiring freeze on researchers and postponed orders for new equipment, and world-class scientists are seeking jobs in the private sector or abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Izzy and children like her are suffering the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For the families involved, this means so much more than the cold budgetary figures cited in congressional debates or across news headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I know what DIPG does to kids,” Janosko said. “Eventually they can’t move, they can’t talk or smile or eat, they can’t see or hear, but their minds are fully intact. That’s the urgency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She put the reality facing her daughter starkly: “If I don’t find a clinical trial for my child, she’ll be dead in a year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-big-funding-freeze" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big funding freeze&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The paradox is hard to miss. Trump’s bid to “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2026/jan/10/mass-surveillance-the-metaverse-making-america-great-again-the-novelists-who-predicted-our-present" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Make America great again”&lt;/a&gt; is undermining an area in which America is already great – at the global forefront of the search for a cure for this disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Over the past 15 years, US medical centers have pioneered breakthroughs in understanding the genetic makeup of child brain tumors. American scientists, working with colleagues around the world, have expanded knowledge of the mutations that cause the tumors to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Those advances have spawned new treatments targeting the cancers’ weak spots at a cellular level. The resulting clinical trials – many of them customized to target the vulnerabilities of each child’s own tumor – do not yet amount to a cure. But they do point towards the path forward. A very small, but potentially significant, number of children with DIPG are still alive several years into treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;The NIH monopoly on directing research should be broken&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many of the greatest innovators in this space have been shaped by the American medical system, or have made their way here from across the world, drawn by its cutting-edge medical research. Despite their disparate roots, they share a common desire to save the lives of children. Neuro-oncologists and surgeons, microbiologists and biostatisticians have joined forces in a team effort that is the envy of other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But science, even at its most altruistic, still needs funding. These cancers are so rare – about 5,000 children are diagnosed with brain tumors in the US each year, including about 300 with the deadly DIPG – that there is little profit incentive to lure big pharma. Federal money is therefore vital, but government support has been limited even during normal administrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pediatric cancers are now the leading cause of death by disease for children in the US, with brain tumors being the most common.

On the frontlines of the disease, scientists and families say the opposite is unfolding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;How the country arrived here is no secret. The blueprint for the administration’s approach to scientific research was set out by&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/project-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; Project 2025&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://static.heritage.org/project2025/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;920-page report&lt;/a&gt; compiled by the rightwing Heritage Foundation. It called for, in effect, the dismantling of the federal National Institutes of Health (NIH) as the world’s largest funder of medical research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The NIH monopoly on directing research should be broken,” the document says on page 462.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Trump appointed the architect of Project 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/10/who-is-russell-vought-trump-office-of-management-and-budget" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Russell Vought&lt;/a&gt;, as the government’s top budget official. In that role, he spearheaded the assault on the NIH, announced the “dramatic overhaul” of the agency, and blocked the release of&lt;a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1949482040727834978" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; of cancer research funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Then there was Elon Musk. Even before Trump’s inauguration, the tech billionaire was intervening in ways that would profoundly affect children with brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A month before Trump returned to the White House, Musk &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/us/politics/elon-musk-spending-bill-fact-check.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; his own platform, X, to push a stream of &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/18/elon-musk-false-claims-cr-00195252" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;falsehoods&lt;/a&gt; and help sink a bipartisan spending bill in Congress. A number of provisions that would have boosted funding for child cancer research &lt;a href="https://www.pcrf-kids.org/2024/12/31/a-heartbreaking-outcome-funding-for-childhood-cancer-research-cut-from-u-s-spending-bill/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;were scrapped&lt;/a&gt;, including a voucher system that would have injected millions of dollars into experimental trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="19827247-827f-444a-ad2a-97d26360f4c4" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="element element--richLink element-richLink dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":41,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Cancer experts alarmed over ‘gut-wrenching’ Trump plan to cut research spending by billions","elementId":"19827247-827f-444a-ad2a-97d26360f4c4","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/26/cancer-research-trump-nci-cuts-plan"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":18,"display":0,"theme":0},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Within days of Trump’s inauguration, the White House imposed a funding freeze on all federal agencies, including the NIH.

Instead of the top 9% of peer-reviewed applications being approved, from now on only 4% would go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And in August, the Trump administration said it would &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/well/pediatric-brain-cancer-trial-group.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;withdraw support&lt;/a&gt; from North America’s oldest and most productive pediatric brain cancer research network – a group that has led the search for a cure for 25 years. All funding for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC), an alliance of 16 leading children’s hospitals in the US and Canada, will end in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Almost overnight, the decision brought many of the continent’s most promising clinical trials to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Children who were already participating in those trials would continue to receive care. But families like Izzy’s had a bitter pill to swallow: the experiments on which they had pinned their last hope would henceforth be closed to new patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-raft-of-closing-trials" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A raft of closing trials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Janoskos live in an idyllic lakeside house an hour’s drive north of New York City. When I visited last month, it looked like a holiday postcard: a light dusting of snow on the lawn, a large American flag flapping over the front porch. Inside, model trains and furry animals were scattered liberally over the living room floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet here was Janosko, amid this idealized vision of American family life, talking to me with tears rolling down her cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Occasionally, her face would betray a look of total and utter bewilderment. How was it possible, after so many years nursing children with brain cancer, that her own daughter had been hit by the disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I just can’t make sense of it,” she said. “Was this my destiny forever?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="77950055-4c49-4332-ad7e-65bca84febac" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Izzy plays with her dad and siblings while the Janosko family spends time together in their living room on a recent afternoon.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Sarah Blesener/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Years spent caring for gravely ill children had left Janosko so anxious about one of her own falling sick that, long before Izzy was diagnosed, she sought therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Whenever a dark thought about her child contracting a terminal illness entered her head, she was encouraged to look at a square and think of something positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She continued having dire ideations for months before the discovery of Izzy’s tumor. She even found herself agreeing with other pediatric nurses that when you formed a family, it was best to have three children. That way, if one of them died, the survivor wouldn’t be an only child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Janosko has three children, of whom Izzy is the eldest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Then one day Izzy’s eyes began crossing themselves, and Janosko’s world imploded. Tests revealed a growing mass on her brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Mark Souweidane, Izzy’s neurosurgeon at Memorial, designed a clinical trial during which &lt;a href="https://neurosurgery.weill.cornell.edu/about-us/news-updates/breakthrough-dipg-pediatric-brain-cancer-treatment-novel-drug-delivery" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;tiny catheters&lt;/a&gt; are inserted directly into the brain tissue to channel high concentrations of therapeutic agents slowly into the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Early tests have been promising. Several children on the trial lived longer than three years, and three patients are long-term survivors. One of them is still alive 12 years on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;I don’t consider it optional to offer research to these kids – I think every one of them should have that option&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When Izzy was first diagnosed, it appeared that she would be a candidate for this novel drug delivery technique. Through the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, Souweidane was only weeks away from launching an expanded trial across 12 medical centers nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Then the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; closed the consortium, forcing Souweidane to call off the launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The other groundbreaking new treatment Janosko hoped to secure is called Car T-cell therapy. It works by extracting T-cells from a patient’s blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;T-cells – the foot soldiers of the immune system – are then trained to recognise and attack specific proteins on the surface of the cancer cells. The repurposed Car T-cells are put back into the body and dispatched to the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Janosko herself nursed the first children who had received Car T-cells for leukemia. She knows several of those pioneer kids who are still alive today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Spurred on by the hope that the success of Car T-cell therapy in childhood leukemia might be transferable, Janosko has lobbied several leading medical centers that are applying it to DIPG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the time of my visit, however, every door remained closed to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="92307207-8203-4a5b-94d3-89af43813afb" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Izzy’s art decorates the walls of the Janosko home.  &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Sarah Blesener/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A clinical trial at Texas Children’s Cancer Center has been suspended as a result of the consortium’s closure.

And at Seattle Children’s hospital, she learned more than 50 kids were already on the waiting list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Professor Sarah Leary, who runs the program in Seattle, said the hardest part of her job was turning frantic parents like Janosko away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I don’t consider it optional to offer research to these kids – I think every one of them should have that option,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She paused, tearing up. “I’ve been doing this for 20 years, and I still get emotional.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After our interview, Janosko took me with her to pick up Izzy from school. The child emerged carrying a pink backpack. She hugged her mother, leaning heavily against her legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Izzy had a shock of golden curls cascading to her shoulders, tied with a red ribbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“That’s a pretty red ribbon,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“No, it’s not pretty,” she fired back, tired and annoyed by the presence of a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“No, I don’t want to say hello,” she corrected her mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Later that day, Janosko texted me a short phone video. In it Izzy, red ribbon still in her hair, looked into the camera and said: “Sorry I was grumpy. It was nice to meet you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Soon after I left, Izzy’s spirits had lifted. “I think her meds are making her more irritable,” her mom said. “I just wanted you to experience her cute side.

It’s the first thing he sees when he looks up from his desk – about 40 smiling faces beaming back at him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Every one of those kids is one of my patients who has passed away,” he said. “It’s a constant reminder. I want to be pushed to remember so I know how urgent this is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That urgency has inspired Hwang, a pediatric neuro-oncologist at George Washington University cancer center in Washington DC, to devote the past 15 years caring for children with brain tumors. He approaches every new child he sees with the ambition to cure them, or at least to prolong their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Even when I think the chances of a patient being cured are low, the chances of them having more time than they would without treatment are high. That is the space in which we function,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hwang led the PBTC’s working group on immunotherapy, and relished its power to move science rapidly forward thanks to “active critical discussion and collaboration”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The idea behind the consortium was quite simple: “Get some of the best minds in the world, put them in a room together, and tell them you don’t leave until you’ve fixed it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;This goes against evolution … It’s like watching a countercurrent &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The wind-down of the consortium leaves him deeply concerned about the future of science itself. So many potentially transformative experiments are ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Where and how are we going to do this kind of science and research?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hwang’s own research has been grinding to a halt. He and Elias Sayour, a pediatric oncologist at the University of Florida &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, were working on devising a new treatment for DIPG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Their approach involves an mRNA vaccine using similar technology to the Covid vaccine. It fires up the body’s immune system – it’s like hitting the nitro button on a racing car, Hwang said – then educates it to be able to recognise and attack a key mutation in the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Planning for the study was already showing exciting results. Tests on mice did not only shrink the tumor, they destroyed it altogether. A separate mRNA vaccine trial with adults had such a massive inflammatory immune response that it made patients sick, but there, too, no viable tumor cells remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is no guarantee that the technology will work for children with DIPG. But in Hwang’s view, it is certainly worth trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A rigorous peer-reviewed process thought the same. It placed Hwang and Sayour’s proposal within the top 7% of grant applications – well within the 9% that had been the federal government’s official cutoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When the qualifying band was reduced to 4%, their hopes and ambitions were set back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s such a major task to walk these families through their darkest times,” Hwang said. “There’s so much uncertainty for them already, and now we have additional uncertainty causing a flight of talent from the research world, slowing the pace of discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Souweidane, the neurosurgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York, whose groundbreaking&lt;a href="https://neurosurgery.weill.cornell.edu/about-us/news-updates/breakthrough-dipg-pediatric-brain-cancer-treatment-novel-drug-delivery" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; catheter delivery trial&lt;/a&gt; Janosko hoped Izzy might join, has also been forced to postpone his plans.

It’s like watching a countercurrent flowing against the evolutionary maturity of cancer therapy and cooperative group trials,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Leary, the Seattle children’s hospital doctor, helps lead several nationwide collaborative bodies for childhood brain cancer. She has noticed that several research laboratories across the country are facing hiring freezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Labs are where much of the heavy lifting is done to analyse the results of clinical trials. They are where some of the big questions are being tackled: why does a particular trial do wonders for 20% of kids, and not the other 80%? How can you tell in advance which kids will be in either cohort?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Federal funding cuts are eating into the capability of labs to answer such critical questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the stranger consequences of Trump’s new regime is that researchers now contort their language to avoid antagonizing the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, over his hostility to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/05/trump-rfk-jr-child-vaccine-recommendations" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;childhood vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Both childhood vaccines and the experimental cancer vaccines rely on mRNA, a molecule that carries genetic instructions inside cells. But in human terms they are apples and oranges: one is designed to protect healthy children from viruses; the other is a last-ditch effort to keep dying children alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;For parents of children who potentially have just a few months left to live, ‘as soon as is feasible’ is a hard sell&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Advice is now circulating privately among top scientists working in many different cancer settings, urging them to avoid using the term “mRNA” in federal applications.

I asked them if they wished to comment about the apparent stark contrast between Trump’s pledge to defeat childhood cancer and the reality on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The HHS responded with a statement. “NIH continues to invest significantly in bold and innovative cancer research,” it said. “Ending the scourge of cancer is one of our highest priorities, as reflected in the National &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Institute’s (NCI’s) budget of more than $7 billion – the largest of any NIH institute or center.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The director of the NCI, Dr Anthony Letai, also commented. He said that the NCI, which leads most US cancer research, spent more last year in extramural grants than in any previous year, and that “pediatric brain cancer research remains a high priority”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He added that the decision to “pivot” away from the consortium had been made for “good logistical reasons”. PBTC trials would be enrolled in a new system “as soon as is feasible”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For parents of children who potentially have just a few months left to live, “as soon as is feasible” is a hard sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As for the White House, a spokesperson asked for details of specific grants that had been cancelled leading to delays in cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I provided the information, but that was the last I heard from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="no-new-patients" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No new patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She’s just a baby! She’s just a baby!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nikki Owens can still hear herself screaming the words after doctors told her that her daughter, Kinlee, had a brain tumor. Owens was 41 at the time. Kinlee was nine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She remembers the moment viscerally – the shock, the disbelief, the sound of her own voice breaking free before she could stop it. Owens is a nurse herself, working with people with learning disabilities. Unlike Janosko, however, she had never heard of DIPG before a doctor delivered the news on 18 December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I met Nikki and Kinlee at the Downtown Aquarium in Houston, Texas, one of Kinlee’s favorite places. It was an emotionally fraught moment: the following day marked the first anniversary of her diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="51399fb2-846d-443d-8e9c-e9be2d03d766" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Kinlee Owens, center, her mother, Nikki Owens, right, and grandmother Pam Zoshak, left, look at fish at the Downtown Aquarium in Houston, Texas. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During our visit, Kinlee sat in a wheelchair wrapped in a Lilo &amp;amp; Stitch blanket. Her hair was immaculately groomed and she had long manicured nails, but she was drowsy and her face was swollen from steroids. Because she could no longer blink with one eye, she wore a mermaid eyepatch. As we passed the tanks with giant stingrays and bamboo sharks, she momentarily perked up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Strangely for an aquarium, there was also a tiger pacing nervously behind glass. The animal looked taut with pent-up energy, bursting to get outside. Owens carried the same tension, as if her body could barely contain the sadness and anger boiling inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I’m pissed. That’s an understatement. I’m infuriated,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It was hard to grasp the extent to which cancer has changed Kinlee. Then her mother sat beside me and opened the photo gallery on her phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She showed me images of a healthy Kinlee dressed as a cheerleader, dancing to Footloose, fishing in the bayou, wearing a filigree white dress. She came across just as her mother describes her: “Quick-witted, sassy, full of one-liners. A busy, active, happy, sociable child. Definitely the life of the party.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2cb1b4d9-bcb4-4b83-a3b4-f0667efbfa54" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A picture of Kinlee Owens from the phone of her mother, Nikki Owens, before she was diagnosed with DIPG, or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At first Kinlee was put on ONC201, one of very few new drugs for deadly child brain tumors to have been&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-dordaviprone-diffuse-midline-glioma" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; FDA-approved&lt;/a&gt;. But it made her so sick she had to stop taking it after just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Next, Owens was told her daughter qualified for two DIPG clinical trials, only to be informed that NIH cuts meant that neither was enrolling new patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Later, she turned to an innovative treatment developed by a biopharma startup called Flag Therapeutics. Its experimental drug, Flag 3, was showing promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Flag 3 also ground to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I contacted Frank Sorgi, Flag Therapeutics’s chief executive, to find out what had happened. He told me that he had created his startup after his wife died of the most deadly adult form of brain tumor, glioblastoma (GBM), in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8c9e8bb9-d119-48ab-a91a-703ee66ee165" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="element element--richLink element-richLink dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":134,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"When I found out about the brain tumour that would kill me, I faced my worst fears – but I chose to take it on","elementId":"8c9e8bb9-d119-48ab-a91a-703ee66ee165","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/28/jessica-morriss-all-in-my-head-book-extract-glioblastoma-brain-cancer"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":18,"display":0,"theme":0},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That gave us a personal connection. My wife,&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/28/jessica-morriss-all-in-my-head-book-extract-glioblastoma-brain-cancer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; Jessica Morris&lt;/a&gt;, also died of GBM in 2021. She had been a medical pioneer, too, having taken part in a number of experimental clinical trials during the five years she lived with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sorgi explained that Flag 3 was a novel small-molecule therapy designed to target, bind and kill cancer cells while leaving normal healthy cells unharmed. Provisional lab tests have been remarkably successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But he hadn’t counted on Elon Musk’s bombardment against government spending in the days before Trump’s inauguration. The tech billionaire scuppered the voucher scheme that would have generated the investment Sorgi was relying upon to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The loss of this funding stream forced Sorgi to cancel plans for a clinical trial. He is still trying to advance his novel drug, but has no idea how to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s like, he said, “having to jump out of a plane without a parachute. I’ll just have to figure out the parachute on the way down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As for Owens, the multiple knockbacks on top of the trauma of Kinlee’s ailment have left her livid. “It’s like a slap in the face after being punched in the gut,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A month before Kinlee was diagnosed, she had joined millions of other Americans in the polling booths to vote for Trump. “Crazy I know, I voted for this man.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She backed him, she said, because she liked his straight talking and had admired how he got things done during his first presidential term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“He buttered me up, made me feel good. Then he turned around and betrayed me,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Betrayed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Oh absolutely. I voted for him without hesitation, then I watched as the dude went rogue. He’ll go and bomb the hell out of a country, blow it to smithereens at the cost of billions, then cut healthcare for children to save money. It doesn’t make any sense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="6673c556-c426-4bd0-b98a-f539eca8fe1d" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Kinlee Owens, left, rests her head on her mother, Nikki Owens, right, during a visit to the aquarium.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-ray-of-hope" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A ray of hope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She was the most courageous person I’ve ever met,” Mike Henry told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mike and his wife, Kate, were both 36 when their daughter Blair was diagnosed with a rare and fast-growing brain tumor called ETMR. She was just shy of three. She died eight months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A month into chemotherapy, the Henrys were presented with a choice so brutal that their oncologist, a veteran with decades of experience, cried as she explained it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She told us it was a fork in the road,” Mike said. “Either we could handcuff Blair to this bed, pin her down to give her shots that made her sick, until she passed away in hospital … or we could spend the next few months with her at home, doing things she loved. We knew that if we decided to take her home, she would die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ten days before her third birthday, they chose home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Blair’s illness and death have transformed the Henrys’ lives beyond recognition. Almost six years later, they still devote themselves to finding a cure to pediatric brain tumors. It’s Blair’s legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kate is now an active member of a bereavement group working in the Philadelphia area. Mike is director of advocacy for the&lt;a href="https://curethekids.org/about/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit that offers family support, raises research funding, and pushes for government action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;His new vocation is to spare other families the disaster that befell his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mike Henry used to work in public policy. That old life now gives him pause. In 2013-14 he was employed by Heritage Action, the political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation that would, a decade later, go on to draft Project 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A decade is a long time in conservative politics. Henry was at Heritage a year before Trump descended the golden staircase, and well before he had remodeled the Republican party in his image. Heritage was not as extreme then as it is today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Still, Henry looks back on how he used to lobby for fiscal responsibility and smaller government, and ponders. Since Blair became sick, the way he perceives the role of government and the importance of caring for one another has changed drastically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He knows now what he did not know then: that, in an instant, any one of us can be toppled from our lives and plummet to the depths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We had a great family, stable jobs, two wonderful children. We lost all of our savings in the first two weeks after the diagnosis. We were thrust on Medicaid, unemployment, then we lost Blair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Giving in is not in our vocabulary&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Their freefall has made Henry a more empathetic person, he thinks. He understands that in America you can do all the right things, be an upstanding citizen, and still get chewed up and spat out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I see now that I was naive to the experience of others,” Henry said, “until I went through it myself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The foundation Henry works for is scrambling, alongside many other charitable groups formed by bereaved parents, to raise money to fill the void left by Trump’s cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They can never compete with the vastness of federal funding, of course. But their voices and passion serve an important purpose: they send a message to politicians on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As Owens put it: “Giving in is not in our vocabulary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The same goes for Hwang. “My initial gut response was anger,” he said. But he has come to see that wallowing in it would only hurt the mission. He is determined to remain calm, present an optimistic face to worried families, and find a new way forward for his mRNA vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If I thought that something was insurmountable, I would just go home. And that would be a disservice to these families and to these children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And there’s another reason not to give up. Every so often, a ray of light pierces through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A couple of weeks after my visit, Janosko contacted me. She had news. Stanford had offered Izzy a place on its Car T-cell clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I’m petrified and I’m ecstatic,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f6c48441-f694-400a-81fc-8a8d0f8943db" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Izzy plays with her parents and sibling in the family playroom.

There will be anxiety aplenty, and possible side-effects. Izzy will shed her cornucopia of golden curls. The treatment might not work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But for some, it does.

A subset of 152 common metabolites was detected in all tissues (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig10"&gt;2e&lt;/a&gt;). Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) and three-dimensional (3D) principal component analysis (PCA) showed that plasma, liver and adipose tissue metabolomes of C26 cachectic animals clearly clustered apart from all other groups (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig1"&gt;1e–h&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig10"&gt;2f–i&lt;/a&gt;). Skeletal muscle and heart metabolite profiles showed a higher variability, especially in the cachectic group, and thereby no clear clustering was observed for these tissues (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig1"&gt;1i–k&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig10"&gt;2j–l&lt;/a&gt;). NC26 and C26 tumours showed marked differences in their profiles despite equal size (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig1"&gt;1l&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig10"&gt;2m,n&lt;/a&gt;). Non-cachexia-inducing NC26 tumours did not cause any major alterations in the metabolite profiles of host tissues compared with Ctrl (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig1"&gt;1e–k&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig10"&gt;2f–l,o&lt;/a&gt;), highlighting that most metabolic alterations are associated with the presence of a cachexia-inducing tumour. The impact of cachexia varied across tissues with 5–38% of significantly altered metabolites (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig1"&gt;1m&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig10"&gt;2o&lt;/a&gt;). The Pre-cax state was characterised by the alteration of a few metabolites, especially in plasma, liver, eWAT and heart, showing the progression towards a cachectic phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical clustering across all tissues and detected metabolites revealed that most cachectic target tissues clustered apart from non-cachectic tissues, with the exception of the soleus muscle (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig11"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). The liver displayed a distinct metabolic profile of its own; however, the metabolites driving the clustering in other tissues were also enriched in cachectic liver. The cluster-defining metabolites were primarily associated with amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, including methylated metabolites, such as sarcosine, dimethyllysine, 1-methyladenosine and 2-methylguanosine (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig11"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). To highlight commonly changed metabolites within each class, we performed hierarchical clustering by metabolite class (amino acids, carbohydrates, energy, lipids, nucleosides, organoheterocyclic compounds and other) and tissue. This demonstrated that amino acids, nucleosides and organoheterocyclic compounds were jointly regulated between cachectic tissues (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig1"&gt;1n&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#MOESM4"&gt;1q–y&lt;/a&gt;), suggesting a coordinated response during cachexia development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec4"&gt;Multi-tissue metabolomics reveals coordinated increase in one-carbon metabolism in cachectic mice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We next performed a more detailed analysis of the different classes of metabolites affected by cachexia. We mostly observed a decrease in energy-related metabolites (metabolites related to glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and ketone bodies) in most of the metabolic tissues (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig12"&gt;4a–h&lt;/a&gt;), while the other classes did not show a unilateral change but rather a remodelling in their composition. Only a few metabolites were affected in the Non-cax and Pre-cax groups, and the Pre-cax group showed higher similarities to the Cax group (Pre × Cax comparison).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the dynamic changes in metabolites between organs, we defined pseudo-time profiles of metabolite levels as a sequence of control, pre-cachectic and cachectic states (Ctrl → Pre-cax → Cax, Non-cax instead of Ctrl for tumour), mimicking the temporal progression of cancer cachexia. We performed clustering of these profiles into eight scenarios: metabolites gradually increased or decreased, at an early or a late disease stage, and so on (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig2"&gt;2a&lt;/a&gt;, middle). Each cluster consisted of 24–151 metabolites. The two largest clusters (#1 and #2) were predominantly composed of amino acids, nucleosides and organoheterocyclic compounds, showing an early (#2) or late (#1) increase towards the Cax state (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig2"&gt;2a&lt;/a&gt;, right). Looking at the top ten metabolites defining each cluster (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig2"&gt;2b,c&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#MOESM1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;), the most prominent cluster #1 (late increase in Cax) was defined by increased levels of several methylated amino acids (for example, sarcosine/methylglycine and trimethyllysine) and derivatives of amino acid metabolism (for example, aminoadipic acid, ureidopropionic acid, glycyl-glutamate and ornithine). Cluster #5 (late decrease in Cax) included metabolites associated with energy homeostasis (for example, malic acid, adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine), underlining the energy deficit in cachexia. Because the same metabolite could be present in different organs, the profiles were traced back to the original organ as a flowchart (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig2"&gt;2a&lt;/a&gt;, left). Remarkably, all host tissues contributed to a similar degree to the different clusters, highlighting the coordinated tissue response to cachexia, whereas the tumour seemed to have a more distinct profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-2" data-title="Multi-tissue metabolomics reveal coordinated increase in one-carbon metabolism in cachectic mice."&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b id="Fig2" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text"&gt;Fig. 2: Multi-tissue metabolomics reveal coordinated increase in one-carbon metabolism in cachectic mice.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure-content"&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure-item"&gt;&lt;a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3/figures/2" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42255-025-01434-3/MediaObjects/42255_2025_1434_Fig2_HTML.png?as=webp"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="Fig2" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42255-025-01434-3/MediaObjects/42255_2025_1434_Fig2_HTML.png" alt="figure 2" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-2-desc"&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig1"&gt;1a&lt;/a&gt; for the experimental set-up.

Levels of these metabolites were altered in a cachexia-specific manner, as highlighted by the highly similar changes in Cax versus Ctrl and Cax versus Non-cax, respectively (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig2"&gt;2f,g&lt;/a&gt;). ‘Amino acids and analogues’ was the most affected class. Next, by performing a pathway analysis of those metabolites (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig2"&gt;2d,e&lt;/a&gt;; list in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig2"&gt;2f,g&lt;/a&gt;), we confirmed that cachexia was associated with a low energetic status, as pathways related to glycolysis, glucose production or TCA cycle were significantly decreased (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig2"&gt;2d,f&lt;/a&gt;).

Unexpectedly, we found that cachexia was associated with an increase in the products of one-carbon metabolism (for example, sarcosine and dimethylglycine) and related pathways, such as pyrimidine synthesis (products of the folate cycle: thymidine, thymine and ureidopropionic acid), and arginine biosynthesis/metabolism (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig2"&gt;2e,g&lt;/a&gt;). Those results suggest a shift towards an increase in the products/substrates ratio of one-carbon metabolism-related metabolites in cachexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One-carbon metabolism is central to multiple physiological processes including nucleotide and protein biosynthesis, redox defence and epigenetic regulation of gene expression&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 22" title="Ducker, G.

It comprises the joint methionine and folate cycles, contributing to essential processes including methylation reactions (DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids), selenoamino acid production, purine, pyrimidine and glutathione synthesis (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig3"&gt;3a&lt;/a&gt;). To run, the cycle requires several methyl acceptors (for example, niacinamide, also known as nicotinamide (NAM) derivative of tryptophan metabolism, glycine, lysine, nucleosides and lipids) leading to the production of methylated products (for example, 1-methylnicotinamide (MNAM), sarcosine, methyllysine, methyladenosine or guanosine). One-carbon metabolism is also tightly associated with polyamine metabolism for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosylmethionine (SAM) recycling (salvage pathway)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 23" title="Sanderson, S.

In our dataset, we checked the overall enrichment of a large subset of substrates and (in)direct products of one-carbon metabolism (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig3"&gt;3a,b&lt;/a&gt;). We observed a clear increase in the levels of the vast majority of these metabolites in all tissues of Cax animals as well as in the tumour (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig3"&gt;3c–g&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig12"&gt;4m–o&lt;/a&gt;), especially in products of this pathway (methylated products of the methionine cycle, such as sarcosine, MNAM, methyllysines, dimethylglycine; and products of the folate cycle, such as thymidine). This is also supported by trends towards elevated SAH/SAM ratios in Cax plasma, adipose tissue and tumour (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig12"&gt;4p&lt;/a&gt;) and THF/5-methylTHF in liver (the only tissue in which such metabolites were detectable; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig12"&gt;4q&lt;/a&gt;). The effect of cachexia on one-carbon metabolites was more pronounced in blood, liver and adipose tissues; nevertheless, we observed the same enrichment profile in cardiac and skeletal muscles (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig3"&gt;3f,g&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig12"&gt;4n&lt;/a&gt;). Interestingly, we observed tissue specificity in terms of methylated products, with MNAM being the main methyl acceptor in liver, sarcosine and methyllysine in adipose tissue and muscles. Adjacent metabolic pathways, such as creatine synthesis, were also upregulated, as reflected by a significant enrichment of creatine levels in liver and adipose tissues (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#MOESM1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;).

The differences in the mRNA expression profile of Non-cax versus Ctrl mice were minor, indicating that a tumour per se is insufficient to induce major host tissue reprogramming (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig13"&gt;5a–e&lt;/a&gt;). By contrast, we observed a huge remodelling of tissue transcriptomes in Cax compared with Ctrl mice, with cachexia explaining 89% to near 100% of gene expression changes (depending on tissues) versus tumour explaining up to 11% changes (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig13"&gt;5a–f&lt;/a&gt;). Pre-cax mice showed an in-between profile between Non-cax and Cax mice, as expected. Overall, 340 genes were significantly altered in a similar manner between metabolic tissues of cachectic animals (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig13"&gt;5g&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed a comparative pathway analysis of all genes significantly altered in the different target tissues of Cax versus Ctrl mice (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig4"&gt;4a&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#MOESM1"&gt;2a&lt;/a&gt;) and Cax versus Non-cax mice (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig13"&gt;5h&lt;/a&gt;) and found that most pathways predicted to be activated in cachexia were related to amino acid metabolism, protein synthesis and post-translational modification (pathways #1–9), highlighting the general protein metabolism remodelling typical for cachexia&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2" title="Berriel Diaz, M., Rohm, M. &amp;amp; Herzig, S. Cancer cachexia: multilevel metabolic dysfunction. Nat. Metab. 6, 2222–2245 (2024)." href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#ref-CR2" id="ref-link-section-d20868623e1606"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These pathways (especially #9) also contain genes encoding for proteins related to one-carbon metabolism, such as the NAM &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyltransferase (&lt;i&gt;Nnmt&lt;/i&gt;, synthesis of MNAM), suggesting they are important targets for amino acid remodelling in cachexia. Other activated pathways were related to inflammatory processes (#10, #14, #18 and #21) and cancer/cachexia (#23 and #26). Meanwhile, all pathways predicted to be inhibited were related to energy production and mitochondrial function (#11, #12, #13, #15, #17 and #19). Next, seeking for potential mechanisms/pathways linking the aforementioned alterations in Cax transcriptome and metabolome, we performed an integrated pathway analysis of both datasets (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig4"&gt;4b&lt;/a&gt;, Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig13"&gt;5i&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#MOESM1"&gt;2b&lt;/a&gt;). Once again, the most significant pathways were related to amino acid metabolism (#1, #7, #12, #15, #19, #22 and #25), urea cycle and polyamine metabolism (#16 and #21), nucleotide metabolism (#9, #17 and #20), oxidative stress/detoxification signalling (#14 and #23) and energy metabolism (#2, #3, #13, #18, #24 and #26). In line with the enrichment of one-carbon metabolites, the combined analysis revealed selenoamino acid metabolism as a major hit, which contained many of the metabolites detailed in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; (for example, MNAM and sarcosine) as well as the genes encoding for enzymes responsible for their production (for example, &lt;i&gt;Mat1a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nnmt&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gnmt&lt;/i&gt;). Overall, this analysis suggests a substantial, coordinated multi-level reprogramming during cachexia, which drives the deep change in tissue metabolism towards amino acid metabolism. Universal activation of one-carbon metabolism in all tissues may therefore support tissue reprogramming in cachexia through various downstream mechanisms involving protein translation and post-translational modifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-4" data-title="Multi-omics integration identifies key nodes in cachexia-associated metabolic reprogramming under the control of IL6."&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b id="Fig4" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text"&gt;Fig. 4: Multi-omics integration identifies key nodes in cachexia-associated metabolic reprogramming under the control of IL6.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure-content"&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure-item"&gt;&lt;a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3/figures/4" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42255-025-01434-3/MediaObjects/42255_2025_1434_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="Fig4" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42255-025-01434-3/MediaObjects/42255_2025_1434_Fig4_HTML.png" alt="figure 4" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-4-desc"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcriptomic analysis of cachexia target tissues from Ctrl, Non-cax and Cax tumour mice.

We observed several tissue-specific gene expression patterns, in line with metabolite levels (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). While &lt;i&gt;Mat1a&lt;/i&gt; (the gene product responsible for the conversion of methionine to SAM) and &lt;i&gt;Nnmt&lt;/i&gt; (the gene product responsible for the conversion of NAM into MNAM) were strongly induced in livers of cachectic animals, in line with a previous report&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 24" title="Mizuno, R. et al.

In addition to tissue-specific gene expression changes, several changes were common across tissues, such as spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (&lt;i&gt;Sat1&lt;/i&gt;) (suggesting an interconnection between methionine cycle and polyamine metabolism), glutathione peroxidase (&lt;i&gt;Gpx3&lt;/i&gt;) and glutathione &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-transferase (&lt;i&gt;Gsta4&lt;/i&gt;) (suggesting alterations in detoxification processes).

Note that C26-IL6-knockout (KO) tumours grew slower than C26-scr tumours but eventually reached a comparable size at endpoint without inducing cachexia (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig13"&gt;5n–q&lt;/a&gt;). We confirmed the substantial regulation of genes related to one-carbon metabolism by IL6 in C26 cachexia in liver, GC muscle and adipose tissue in these two independent cohorts (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig4"&gt;4h,i&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig13"&gt;5r–u&lt;/a&gt;). For instance, &lt;i&gt;Nnmt&lt;/i&gt; induction in liver by C26 tumours was repressed by 77% with IL6-neutralising antibody, and by 89% upon IL6 KO in C26 cells. Metabolomics confirmed the significant increase of multiple products of the one-carbon metabolism in C26 cachectic liver (for example, #10 MNAM and #18 thymidine) and GC muscle (for example, #11 di- and #12 tri-methyllysine) and the near-complete absence of their enrichment upon IL6 KO (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig4"&gt;4j,k&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, our analysis suggests a coordinated remodelling of the tissue transcriptomes and metabolomes in cachexia, in part driven by the pro-inflammatory status of cachectic animals, that activates one-carbon metabolism in a universal manner to sustain the remodelling of protein metabolism inherent to cachexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec6"&gt;Overactivation of the methionine cycle drives atrophy and metabolic dysfunction in myotubes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To functionally connect the activation of one-carbon metabolism with cachexia phenotypes, we treated C2C12 myotubes with different doses of &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-methionine to experimentally induce one-carbon metabolism, confirmed by increased levels of associated metabolites (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig5"&gt;5a&lt;/a&gt;).

Furthermore, &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-methionine altered myotube metabolism towards higher glucose consumption, as indicated by lower glucose and lower pH in the cell medium (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig5"&gt;5d,e&lt;/a&gt;).

As expected, FIDAS-5 significantly reduced one-carbon metabolite levels (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig14"&gt;6f&lt;/a&gt;) and led to a phenotype opposite to &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-methionine-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner, characterised by myotube hypertrophy associated with reduced glucose consumption, suggesting hypometabolism (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig14"&gt;6g–j&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we have shown in vivo the importance of IL6 in inducing one-carbon metabolism in cachexia, we next assessed the capacity of FIDAS-5 to counteract cachexia features in C2C12 cells treated with recombinant IL6. We confirmed that the induction of IL6 signalling (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig14"&gt;6k,l&lt;/a&gt;) was associated with an induction of one-carbon metabolites (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig14"&gt;6m&lt;/a&gt;) and myotube atrophy (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig14"&gt;6n,o&lt;/a&gt;), which was rescued upon FIDAS-5 treatment. FIDAS-5 also significantly reduced glucose consumption in IL6-treated cells (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig14"&gt;6p,q&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we assessed whether this link between one-carbon metabolism and cachexia features was restricted to muscle cells or also applied to other cell types, that is, adipocytes. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with different doses of &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-methionine, analogous to the experiment in C2C12 cells (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;), did not affect lipolysis or glucose consumption (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig14"&gt;6r–t&lt;/a&gt;), suggesting that the connection is indeed cell type specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, our data suggest that activation of one-carbon metabolism is an energy-consuming process that could contribute to glucose hypermetabolism and muscle atrophy in cachexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec7"&gt;Cachexia causes rewiring of glucose flux in skeletal and cardiac muscle&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We next assessed alteration in glucose flux in the different tissues of cachectic mice, taking advantage of the injection of [&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]-glucose (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig1"&gt;1a&lt;/a&gt;). After 1 h, mainly intermediates of glycolysis and the TCA cycle were labelled. We observed very different responses to glucose between cachexia target tissues.

In WAT depots, total and labelled citrate levels were unchanged in C26-TB mice compared with controls, whereas unlabelled succinate and fumarate were increased. This indicates that alternative carbon sources (for example, from β-oxidation or amino acid degradation) feed the TCA cycle. However, because these cannot replenish the truly anaplerotic substrates, alternative carbon sources cannot keep TCA running alone, ultimately causing a block in the TCA cycle (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig15"&gt;7c,d&lt;/a&gt;).

Statistical analysis: one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-hoc tests versus Ctrl. *&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, **&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01 compared with Ctrl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#MOESM14"&gt;Source data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, M + 3-labelled citrate, succinate, fumarate and malate stem from the action of pyruvate carboxylase (PC). Thus, the significant increase in M + 3 labelling of these metabolites in muscles of Cax mice indicates that PC is active, providing intermediates to the TCA cycle. [1-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]-pyruvate tracing in C2C12 myotubes (pyruvate labelled only on the first carbon) showed M + 1 labelling of TCA intermediates, confirming that PC is active in muscle cells (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#MOESM1"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). Increased M + 0 citrate and malate (derived from the non-labelled carbons of [1-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C] pyruvate) upon methionine treatment also indicated a hypermetabolic state in myotubes in which one-carbon metabolism was overactivated. Of note, the elevated M + 0 TCA intermediates without a proportional M + 1 increase in [1-¹³C]pyruvate-traced, methionine-treated C2C12 myotubes reflect the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)-dominant flux pattern amplified by hypermetabolic demands, isotope dilution from unlabelled anaplerotic sources, and metabolic rewiring induced by one-carbon metabolism activation. Methionine treatment induced coordinated metabolic reprogramming that increased anaplerotic flux from multiple unlabelled sources to maintain TCA cycle function despite ongoing catabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We next performed metabolic modelling of [&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]-glucose labelling data to assess the flux of different metabolite sources feeding the TCA cycle in the GC muscle of Ctrl, Pre-cax and Cax mice (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig16"&gt;8g,h&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#MOESM5"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). We normalised the fluxes for each group to citrate synthase activity (&lt;i&gt;V12&lt;/i&gt;). Relative flux through PC and PDH was increased in GC muscle (&lt;i&gt;V9&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;V10&lt;/i&gt;), indicating that more glucose enters the TCA cycle. By contrast, the relative flux filling the acetyl-CoA pool from fatty acid oxidation and ketogenic amino acids (&lt;i&gt;V11&lt;/i&gt;) was decreased. We observed a significantly increased flux through 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (&lt;i&gt;V18&lt;/i&gt;) in cachectic muscle, and trends towards increased succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase and malate dehydrogenase (&lt;i&gt;V19–21&lt;/i&gt;) activities, supporting the increase in flux at almost all reactions of the cycle. This occurs despite normalization to citrate synthase activity, which is already elevated in Cax muscle, as shown in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig6"&gt;6a,b&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, our flux analysis highlighted the significantly increased usage of glutamine (including also glucogenic amino acid backbones) as a substrate for the TCA cycle (&lt;i&gt;V16&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;V17&lt;/i&gt;). The Pre-cax state showed trends towards increased flux in all above-mentioned reactions despite unchanged body weight and composition, indicating that glucose hypermetabolism in muscle may be an early event contributing to cachexia (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig16"&gt;8h&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, our data revealed clear tissue-specific alterations in glucose usage in cachexia, especially an unexpected hypermetabolism of skeletal and cardiac muscles upon nutrient availability, which could contribute to energy loss in cachexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec8"&gt;Activation of one-carbon metabolism is a unifying feature of cancer cachexia in mice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess whether the described multi-organ changes in one-carbon metabolism are specific to the C26 mouse model or a more general feature of cancer cachexia, we assessed the gene expression and metabolite profiles of liver and muscle in five additional mouse models: Apc&lt;sup&gt;Min&lt;/sup&gt; (ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 8" title="Morigny, P. et al.

These include genes encoding for key methyltransferases such as &lt;i&gt;Nnmt&lt;/i&gt;, glycine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyltransferase (&lt;i&gt;Gnmt&lt;/i&gt;) (conversion of glycine into sarcosine), &lt;i&gt;Kmt2a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Kmt2b&lt;/i&gt;, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (&lt;i&gt;Mthfr&lt;/i&gt;) (key step of folate cycle, conversion of 5,10-methyleneTHF to 5-methylTHF), methionine adenosyltransferases (&lt;i&gt;Mat1a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mat12a&lt;/i&gt;) (conversion of methionine to SAM), &lt;i&gt;Sat1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gpx3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gsta4&lt;/i&gt;. Once again, such analyses confirmed tissues’ specificity regarding key methyltransferases in cachexia (for example, &lt;i&gt;Nnmt&lt;/i&gt; in liver and &lt;i&gt;Kmt&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;) in muscle).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in the C26 model, we also observed an accumulation of metabolites associated with elevated one-carbon metabolism (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig7"&gt;7d–g&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig17"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;) (for example, #9 sarcosine, #10 MNAM, #11 di- and #12 tri-methyllysines and #18 thymidine) in the liver and muscle of cachectic animals compared with their respective controls (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig7"&gt;7e,f&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig17"&gt;9f,g,m,n,t,u&lt;/a&gt;). In PDAC models, we also observed similar alterations in one-carbon-related metabolites in plasma and adipose tissue (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig7"&gt;7d,g&lt;/a&gt;). Induction of one-carbon metabolism in the PDAC experiment was gradual with cachexia severity, with Panc02-Mild and 8025-Mild groups exhibiting gene and metabolite patterns in-between healthy controls and 8025-Cax (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig7"&gt;7b–g&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig17"&gt;9ab&lt;/a&gt;). Of note, differences in the amplitude of the regulation of individual metabolites and genes between the various mouse experiments may be explained by several factors such as tumour entity, mouse strain, feeding status or experimental set-up. While C26, Panc02, 8025 and APC&lt;sup&gt;Min&lt;/sup&gt; cohorts were fasted for 6 h, optimised for metabolic studies, LLC and KPP experiments were not specifically designed for metabolic assays and were necropsied in random-fed conditions. Nevertheless, the conserved alteration in gene expression and metabolites in six independent mouse models highlights the tissue-overarching activation of one-carbon metabolism as a hallmark of cachexia, associated with different tumour entities and cachexia trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linking the activation of one-carbon metabolism with muscle glucose hypermetabolism, we also investigated [&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]-glucose tracing in GC muscle of Panc02 and 8025 tumour bearing mice (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig7"&gt;7a,h–o&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C labelling showed an overall enrichment of labelled TCA cycle metabolites in PDAC mice compared with Ctrl, increasing gradually with cachexia severity. Tracing isotopologues also confirmed the enrichment of highly labelled isotopologues (M + 4 or higher), particularly in 8025-Cax mice, supporting the notion of increased glucose flux through the TCA cycle in cachectic muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the PDAC experiments (representing a different genetic background, tumour entity and laboratory environment) recapitulated our main findings from the C26 model regarding one-carbon metabolism and glucose hypermetabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec9"&gt;Activation of one-carbon metabolism associated with muscle hypermetabolism is also a feature of cachexia in the humanised SW480-tumour mouse model&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To verify the relevance of our findings for patients, we first checked the expression of key enzymes related to one-carbon metabolism in liver and skeletal muscle from patients with cancer with or without sarcopenia (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig8"&gt;8a,b&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#MOESM6"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). Sarcopenia was associated with increased gene expression of &lt;i&gt;NNMT&lt;/i&gt; and increased expression of the signature gene set overall, in accordance with our previous observation linking this pathway to muscle wasting in different mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-8" data-title="Activation of one-carbon metabolism associated with muscle hypermetabolism is also a feature of cachexia in the humanised SW480-tumour mouse model."&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b id="Fig8" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text"&gt;Fig. 8: Activation of one-carbon metabolism associated with muscle hypermetabolism is also a feature of cachexia in the humanised SW480-tumour mouse model.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure-content"&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure-item"&gt;&lt;a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3/figures/8" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42255-025-01434-3/MediaObjects/42255_2025_1434_Fig8_HTML.png?as=webp"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="Fig8" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42255-025-01434-3/MediaObjects/42255_2025_1434_Fig8_HTML.png" alt="figure 8" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-8-desc"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;, Relative mRNA expression level of key enzymes of one-carbon metabolism and related pathways in liver (&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;) and skeletal muscle (&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;) of patients with cancer with or without sarcopenia (no sarcopenia: &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 9 liver samples, 7 muscle samples; sarcopenia, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 19 liver samples, 17 muscle samples).

Tumour-bearing mice developed a clear cachectic phenotype, with a significant reduction in final body weight and tissue mass (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig18"&gt;10a–e&lt;/a&gt;). Consistent with findings from other mouse models of cachexia and from patients, gene expression of enzymes related to one-carbon metabolism was significantly changed in liver, muscle and adipose tissue of cachectic SW480 animals compared with Ctrl (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig8"&gt;8d,e&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig18"&gt;10f&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, we observed a highly significant induction of metabolites related to one-carbon metabolism in all tissues from these animals, including plasma, liver, heart, skeletal muscles and adipose tissues (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig8"&gt;8f–i&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig18"&gt;10g–i&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, while unlabelled TCA cycle metabolite levels in cardiac and skeletal muscles were mostly decreased or unchanged in the SW480 cachectic condition, labelled TCA cycle metabolites were enriched (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig8"&gt;8j–t&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01434-3#Fig18"&gt;10j,k&lt;/a&gt;), indicating higher glucose flux through the TCA cycle, comparable to the C26 and PDAC models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, our data highlight the existence of a spatio-temporally coordinated response across multiple cachexia target tissues, characterised by the activation of the one-carbon metabolism, which is conserved between multiple different models of murine and human cancer. Activation of one-carbon metabolism is associated with glucose hypermetabolism in cachectic muscle in independent models and potentially contributes to muscle wasting in cachexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 10:18:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE4yT2Y0MF9IVUtoZkdjUVZZdlVfWlQyWkVabW1COExWMlhuOVJ0X0h1QU4zWEhMQzZvMEVRVEU1ZThiRmgwcXpfTFNsV29NUlJiZGpTOXZ4TUthVmx3V1Rz</guid></item><item><title>克服失眠焦虑并重新入睡的4种方法- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2026/01/15/nx-s1-5611117/beat-anxiety-insomnia-get-back-to-sleep</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;
      
   &lt;p&gt;Clinical psychologist &lt;a href="https://www.drorma.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Steve Orma&lt;/a&gt; was in his early 40s when he developed insomnia — difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;He couldn't stop fixating on it. "I started getting into the frame of mind most people get sucked into. I worried, 'What's going on? Is there something wrong with me?'" he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That fear of not being able to sleep is a phenomenon called "sleep anxiety," says Orma, who went on to become a specialist in insomnia treatment. Left untreated, that anxiety can prevent people from actually falling asleep.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The more you focus on it, the less chance you'll sleep, which then makes you more anxious. That's the cycle that spins," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;One of the most powerful ways to overcome sleep anxiety is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). It's well studied, doesn't rely on sleep drugs and has been shown to be effective for clinical insomnia. Orma used this treatment to heal his sleep, and it's now the main focus of his therapy practice.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Typically, a CBT-I program lasts about six to eight weeks, and each week, you and a provider work on a strategy to reset sleep behaviors and restructure your thinking around rest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But you don't have to be in an official program to benefit from CBT-I. Whether you're dealing with some sleep stress or just the occasional off-night, these CBT-I practices can help.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Wake up at the same time every day&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Having a consistent wake-up time helps your body know when it's time to get sleepy, says Aric Prather, a sleep scientist and the author of &lt;a href="https://www.aricprather.com/the-sleep-prescription" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sleep Prescription: 7 Days to Unlocking Your Best Rest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The sleepy cues are managed by your circadian rhythm, or your body's internal clock. A set wake-up time keeps your internal clock ticking on time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Prather uses the analogy of a "sleep balloon." When you wake up, your sleep balloon is empty. Your balloon fills up with sleepiness throughout the day. Once it's full, you feel ready to sleep. Waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends, keeps your sleep cues consistent.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Focus on a wind-down time, not a bedtime &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to force yourself to go to bed at a specific time, even though you're not sleepy, focus on&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;winding down for bed earlier, says &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/ravi-aysola" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Ravi Aysola&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Sleep Disorders Center at the University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pick a time to transition from daytime activities to nighttime activities. This can look like unplugging from screens, putting on comfortable clothes and dimming the lights in your home.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says having a wind-down time instead of a strict bedtime can help lessen the feeling that you must get to sleep immediately — and can reduce the anxiety that can occur when you don't.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Schedule your "worry time"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If all your stress comes flooding in at bedtime, put some dedicated "worry time" on your calendar during the daylight hours, says Prather. "Use your brain space when you're more rested to do some worrying."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That way, if your brain starts to drift to tax season, child care troubles or that big mess in the garage while you're in bed, "you have a way of saying, 'I did this worrying already,'" he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Try taking just 10 or 15 minutes at the same time each day to write out what's bothering you. It can help your brain relax when your head hits the pillow, Prather says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Be mindful when tracking sleep&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Managing sleep anxiety means also being cognizant of how much information you're taking in about your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of sleep-tracking devices and wearables has led to the advent of orthosomnia, a type of insomnia developed from anxiety over wanting to achieve perfect sleep data, says Aysola.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sleep trackers can give you helpful information about how you slept, but it's important to have a healthy level of skepticism when it comes to the data and a plan for what you'll do with it, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;If you use these devices to track your sleep, he says to ask yourself: "Is that information helping you make changes in your behavior or lifestyle, or is it stressing you out and making the insomnia worse?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you notice you've been waking up feeling more rested, for example, that could tell you that your new wind-down time and earlier morning alarm are starting to work for you.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you tend to fixate on your sleep-tracker data, try tracking your sleep with a pen and paper instead. It can help you focus on how your sleep is &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; to you instead of the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Reshaping your sleep habits is only half the battle, Orma says. The rest of the work comes down to shifting your mindset. Sleep will vary from night to night and everyone has a bad night of sleep now and then, so adjust your expectations accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When you have that frame of mind, your sleep starts to get better," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="hr"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib, with art direction by Beck Harlan.

	        &lt;p&gt;During a visit to the Cary’s home in Dayton, 3-year-old Bennett abruptly stops his playtime to make some proper introductions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hi, I’m Bennett, and this is my baby brother, Bear,” he said, gesturing to his brother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then pointed to his abdomen.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And this is Todd.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todd is the name Bennett gave his new liver, which he received in October after a hard-fought battle with hepatoblastoma — a form of liver cancer most common in children younger than 3 years old, according to the National Cancer Institute.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bennett also named his port-a-cath as Ted, which now lives in a plastic bag in their kitchen drawer. It’s one of the only physical relics left of six months spent doing everything possible to save Bennett’s life at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bennett’s parents, Natalia and Ben Cary, said Wings Regional Cancer Support in Kalispell covered the transportation costs associated with flying to and from Minnesota. Wings has helped residents of Northwest Montana pay for the out-of-pocket costs associated with cancer treatment since 1997.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Bennett, his mother and siblings were able to stay in nearby Eau Claire, Wisconsin with Natalia’s parents, Ben continued to return home for work during his son’s treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The money (from Wings) helped us continue to do what we needed to do, as far as what was mission critical,” Ben said. “We're incredibly grateful and indebted to the community that donates to that fund ... You can see how intense this whole journey was,." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben and Natalia remember the exact day their lives changed. It was June 21, 2025 and Natalia was getting concerned about Bennett’s growing fever.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He had a fever for two days, which was unlike him. He was like the epitome of great health for a 3-year-old ... He just had a little bump (near his ribcage) and I thought maybe it was a hernia. But with the fever, I was like, ‘I'll just take him in,’” Natalia said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She took Bennett to St. Joseph Medical Center in Polson, but it was a weekend, and their imaging staff was not there. They asked her to return on Monday, but there was a gnawing feeling that something was not right.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I said ‘I’m going to drive to Missoula ... And it all went downhill from there. When I got the diagnosis, I was in so much shock that I had a seizure,” Natalia said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The staff at the hospital in Missoula told Natalia that Bennett’s liver was covered in tumors and that he would need to be sent to an out-of-state hospital as soon as possible for tests and treatment. Natalia was just three months postpartum, at the hospital with Bennett and her newborn son Beau.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben was in route to Missoula, driven by his boss at Silver Creek Construction, when he got a call from the hospital.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They said, ‘We're sorry to tell you, sir, but your wife has had a seizure and she's been convulsing, and we're going to have to admit her. And we're kind of taking care of your  newborn right now, so how quick are you going to get here?’” Ben recalled. “We just hit the gas ... And when I got to Missoula I jumped on a medical flight with Bennett, and we flew straight to Mayo.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once they got to the Mayo Clinic, Bennett’s biopsy results revealed his full diagnosis: non-metastatic hepatoblastoma, Pretext 4 — meaning all four sections of his liver had tumors. Early on, his oncologist told them a liver transplant would most likely be necessary.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We really didn’t want him to have to be on chemo for a long time. And you don't know if the cancer is going to come back if the chemo makes it go away. We had accepted early on that Bennett could be receiving a new liver,” Natalia said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting that process early helped their case, but Bennett still needed to have 12 weeks of chemotherapy, with two different medications taken once a week.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After those 12 weeks, doctors would perform another scan. If the tumor had shrunk enough, surgery was the next step. If not, he would undergo another round of chemo followed by a liver transplant, according to an update posted to Bennett’s CaringBridge page.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did Bennett’s new liver have to be a blood match, it had to come from a child of around the same age. There was not an option to graft parts of another liver onto his because of how many tumors he had — the only way it would work was if he received a completely new organ.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's very extensive. And the sad thing is with kids that have had hepatoblastoma, if it spreads and metastasizes, they can't get a transplant. So that was probably the scariest part,” Natalia said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also an issue with his health insurance coverage when he arrived at the Mayo Clinic. Ben said they learned the state’s Healthy Montana Kid’s Program couldn’t be used in a state as far away as Minnesota, so they were asked to seek another insurance policy for Bennett.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben was able to get a favorable policy for Bennett through Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana. The parents said their caseworker at the insurance company helped them through many hurdles, quickly giving approval for time-sensitive procedures.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bennett didn’t always respond well to chemotherapy, with Natalia calling him a “day-by-day kid,” not sure how he would feel on any given day during his treatment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family spent endless nights in his room. Natalia said they got through it by playing with lots of Legos and taking Bennett on walks to the hospital’s chapel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mayo Clinic’s chapel is grand, with tall, curved ceilings and ornate stonework. Natalia said it felt like a place of calmness for Bennett.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was another reminder that God was with their family — she and Ben said they survived by taking a deep dive into their spiritual relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back home in Montana, Ben was searching for ways to get financial help for their situation. Hitting a wall, he eventually heard about Wings. A friend had been a Wings recipient in the past and let him know that he should apply.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn't even send any receipts the first time, I just sent my name and with the application to see if we were going to be accepted,” Ben said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wings went on to reimburse Ben for their airfare and other expenses that were necessary when living in-and-out of the hospital, like clothes and baby supplies for their two other young sons.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t the last showing of support they would see from their community.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tamarack Brewing Co. hosted a tap night with benefits going to the Mayo Clinic, Dayton Presbyterian Church donated money to the family and many others in the community gave as well through financial contributions and acts of kindness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Shelby and Penny at the Flathead County Landfill, they gave me these wooden crosses. And she was like, ‘Whenever you're stressed out, you can just rub this,’” Ben said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bennett received his new liver on Oct. 4. Natalia said she’d never seen him so happy, as the 3-year-old woke up instantly feeling better. There were still hurdles ahead — Bennett’s body showed initial signs of rejecting the liver — but he recovered, and the family was home attending their local church service by Christmas Eve.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Bennett runs crazy around the family’s living room, chasing his younger brother and playing with their dogs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a sight Natalia and Ben will always be grateful for.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For all the moms and dads who think something could be wrong — had I listened to the first ER doctors, Bennett wouldn’t have made it through that weekend. You never imagine it will happen to you. But I know God has a good plan for him (Bennett.)” Natalia said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bennett and his family may make an appearance during Wings’ annual radiothon, which takes place Jan. 15 and 16 at Sportsman and Ski Haus in Kalispell.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual effort aims to help the group continue covering the out-of-pocket costs associated with cancer treatment.

Roast the veg first to get a deeper flavor.

I roast them and use them all week—in goodness bowls, sides, or mashed with cinnamon and salt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet potatoes are complex carbohydrates, which means they provide a steady supply of energy. They are full of vitamin A, which supports immunity and boosts eye health, while the fiber aids digestion and helps to keep your gut working efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potassium in sweet potatoes is also known to support muscle and nerve function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-5-avocado" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-avocado"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5.

I mix it with olive oil, lemon, and herbs or add it straight to a bowl.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3s boost cognitive and heart health, and are known for their anti-inflammatory properties, making them a good choice for anyone with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), arthritis and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re plant-based and want a big hit of omega-3s, swap fish for walnuts, which you can add on top of salads, curries and stews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-7-grass-fed-ground-beef" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-7-grass-fed-ground-beef"&gt;&lt;span&gt;7.

Grass-fed typically has more omega-3s in it than other types of beef.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are plant-based, a high-protein alternative to beef is tempeh or tofu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-8-medjool-dates" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-8-medjool-dates"&gt;&lt;span&gt;8.

			&lt;p&gt;Some mosquitoes have become increasingly reliant &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-is-a-shockingly-weird-reason-mosquitoes-always-seem-to-find-us-says-study"&gt;on human blood&lt;/a&gt;, new research shows – and it's probably our own fault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sampling study of the bloodsuckers in Brazil has found that as biodiversity drops, mosquitoes are more likely to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-mosquitoes-are-using-infrared-to-track-humans-down"&gt;hunt &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; down&lt;/a&gt;. It makes sense, really: As human activity pushes other animals out of the region, mozzies have fewer alternatives to feast on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consequences are more dire than just an itchy annoyance, though. Mosquitoes are key &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/us-man-dies-from-rare-disease-following-mosquito-bite"&gt;vectors of disease&lt;/a&gt;, so a shift in preference for biting humans can have major health implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/jurassic-park-was-right-mosquitoes-really-can-carry-libraries-of-animal-dna"&gt;Jurassic Park Was Right: Mosquitoes Really Can Carry Libraries of Animal DNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and the Oswaldo Cruz Institute set up light traps in two nature reserves in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil, to capture 52 species of mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189051" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189051" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Reserva-Ecologica-do-Guapiacu-REGUA-Cachoeiras-de-Macacu-Rio-de-Janeiro-642x361.jpg" alt="Wildlife in a green reserve" class="size-medium wp-image-189051" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Reserva-Ecologica-do-Guapiacu-REGUA-Cachoeiras-de-Macacu-Rio-de-Janeiro-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Reserva-Ecologica-do-Guapiacu-REGUA-Cachoeiras-de-Macacu-Rio-de-Janeiro-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Reserva-Ecologica-do-Guapiacu-REGUA-Cachoeiras-de-Macacu-Rio-de-Janeiro-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Reserva-Ecologica-do-Guapiacu-REGUA-Cachoeiras-de-Macacu-Rio-de-Janeiro.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189051" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cachoeiras de Macacu – one of the reserves where mosquitoes were collected.

Of these, 24 contained identifiable DNA, which contained traces of 18 different humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next highest group was birds, with blood from six different birds present in the samples, while amphibian, rodent, and canid blood each turned up once in the samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here we show that the mosquito species we captured in remnants of the Atlantic Forest have a clear preference for feeding on humans," &lt;a href="https://frontiersin.org/news/2026/01/15/mosquitoes-human-blood-biodiversity-loss"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Jeronimo Alencar, biologist at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could be a few reasons for the high human count, the team says. But the most obvious is that with increased deforestation, there are just more people around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With fewer natural options available, mosquitoes are forced to seek new, alternative blood sources. They end up feeding more on humans out of convenience, as we are the most prevalent host in these areas," &lt;a href="https://frontiersin.org/news/2026/01/15/mosquitoes-human-blood-biodiversity-loss"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sergio Machado, microbiologist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team says more detailed analysis is needed, including perhaps better methods for capturing the insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The light traps are much more likely to attract hungry mosquitoes, while those that have recently fed prefer to sleep it off, making them harder to catch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of mosquito feeding habits could improve &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drug-for-rare-disease-turns-human-blood-into-mosquito-poison"&gt;disease prevention strategies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2025.1721533/full"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The first step was identifying which of the region’s roughly 40 mosquito species were biting. This involved careful scrutiny of the creatures with a stereoscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The identification itself is not complicated,” Machado says, “but there is a shortage of entomologists to perform it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This fact, along with the need to transport the mosquitoes back to Rio de Janeiro for analysis, meant by the time the samples were analyzed, the DNA and RNA inside of them had started to break down. Even with these difficulties, the analysis provided Machado with a pretty good idea of which mammal species the mosquitoes in question preferred for dinner. In several cases, this &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/drug-turn-blood-mosquito-poison-170000526.html" data-ylk="slk:blood was human;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;blood was human&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This was something we didn’t expect,” Machado says. “Since we were in a forest reserve, we expected to find DNA from vertebrates in the local fauna.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Related Mosquito Stories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/scientists-engineer-mosquito-std-combat-140000120.html" data-ylk="slk:Scientists engineer mosquito STD to combat malaria;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Scientists engineer mosquito STD to combat malaria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/mosquitoes-barely-see-male-vision-150000199.html" data-ylk="slk:Mosquitoes can barely see–but a male’s vision perks up when they hear a female;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Mosquitoes can barely see–but a male’s vision perks up when they hear a female&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/mosquitos-seem-beer-drinkers-recently-183508516.html" data-ylk="slk:Mosquitos seem to like beer drinkers who recently had sex;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Mosquitos seem to like beer drinkers who recently had sex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/world-without-mosquitoes-look-120000143.html" data-ylk="slk:What would a world without mosquitoes look like?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;What would a world without mosquitoes look like?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Shifting tastes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So why so much &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/mosquitoes-fly-full-of-blood/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:human blood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;human blood&lt;/a&gt;? The researchers hypothesize that the Atlantic Forest’s changing environment has led these species to develop a taste for human blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We believe it’s a matter of opportunity given the lack of a preferred food source,” Machado says. “It seems that if mosquitoes can’t find their preferred blood source, they seek out whatever is available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/climate-change/qa-infectiousdiseases-who.pdf?sfvrsn=3a624917_3" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:biodiversity declines and animal species go extinct;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;biodiversity declines and animal species go extinct&lt;/a&gt;, more mosquito food sources are disappearing. However, unlike many of the animals on which they feed, mosquitoes are adaptable creatures. There’s almost always a ready-made alternative, including humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While this might be good news for the mosquitoes, it risks being terrible news for humans. As an increasing number of mosquito species develop a taste for humans, so too does the risk that species which have not been particularly problematic in the past could act as new vectors for &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/scientists-engineer-mosquito-std-combat-140000120.html" data-ylk="slk:blood-borne diseases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;blood-borne diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Once mosquitoes acquire a new food source, they tend to develop a preference for that particular blood—and humans are one species whose availability is most definitely &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;declining. Today, the Atlantic Forest occupies &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-025-01508-w" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:barely a quarter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;barely a quarter&lt;/a&gt; third of its former area, and it’s not alone. With every passing year, more wilderness is lost to human incursion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The answer seems to be first arresting, and then reversing, this process of deforestation and habitat destruction. But it’s not altogether clear that the damage is so easily reversible. Humans certainly aren’t going anywhere, so who’s to say that the mosquitoes won’t just keep feeding merrily on us regardless?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Machado expresses cautious optimism on how we can address how deforestation affects what mosquitoes eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We believe this is a reversible process, but this will require restoring the biome while simultaneously continuing our study. We are still seeking more evidence that [these] mosquitoes have a preferred food source. For now, we are observing that there is a possibility that they are adapting to different sources and do not [prefer] human blood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Jumping species&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nevertheless, humanity continues to play with fire as it pushes further and further into previously unspoilt ecosystems. A&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1088493/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:landmark 2001 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; landmark 2001 study&lt;/a&gt; found that new diseases are twice as likely to be zoonotic—transmissible between animals and humans—than existing ones. The danger posed by such diseases was exemplified by &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/category/covid-19/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:COVID-19;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/why-bats-spread-many-diseases-184226580.html" data-ylk="slk:jumped from bats to humans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;jumped from bats to humans &lt;/a&gt;to catastrophic effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While disastrous scenarios surrounding a novel pathogen spread by mosquitoes are hypothetical, there are also very real dangers linked to deforestation. For instance, the &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/scientists-engineer-mosquito-std-combat-140000120.html" data-ylk="slk:malaria parasite;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;malaria parasite&lt;/a&gt; in the Amazon is largely spread by the &lt;em&gt;Anopheles darlingi&lt;/em&gt; mosquito. It was thought to have been eradicated in the 1960s, but re-emerged in the 1990s, and is now common. Another &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3757555/pdf/nihms151521.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that cleared forest patches had created a perfect breeding environment for the insect, helping its return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ultimately, Machado stresses that it’s important to control the emergence of new &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/mosquitoes-climate-change/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:disease vectors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;disease vectors&lt;/a&gt; and thus mitigate further risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The re-establishment of ecosystems will certainly contribute to this and should minimize the climate changes we are experiencing,” he says. “We need to learn that our actions today, however small, will always have global repercussions in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOdDR2c1F2YzJldUJ6N1d6NzRCVTdKUjVkejRQOW0teWtsNFF2QURHSTFDWTVUTlpQRTRJR1ZRRlA4MFF4OF93d2dNZ3lxNUE3MEp1amctS3dIOElrWVB6dl8xS25PU0JJV2pBTFExQU9QTkZfd1lHS2kyd2VoVXk4WXVISkhRWGhnSW9QMERHdkR4dw</guid></item><item><title>医疗团体将要求法院阻止新的CDC疫苗建议- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/14/health/vaccine-recommendations-aap-block</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Last week, HHS announced &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/health/childhood-vaccine-schedule-overhaul"&gt;changes to the vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt; for American children that narrowed recommendations for vaccinations against meningococcal disease, hepatitis B and hepatitis A to people at higher risk for infections. the updated CDC schedule also recommends that decisions on vaccinations against flu, Covid-19 and rotavirus be based on “shared clinical decision-making,” which means people who want one must consult with a health care provider. HHS said that all insurers will still cover these vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo1rls0004336puq4se4s9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When there were previous changes to the government’s vaccine recommendations, new evidence published in the scientific literature or presented by vaccine makers would be evaluated by the CDC’s vaccine advisers, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo54dq000i336pm3pqpr63@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that wasn’t the case with the latest changes; no new evidence was brought to the committee to challenge the safety or effectiveness of the recommended vaccines. Rather, the decision was made in the wake of an order from President Donald Trump to HHS to review the US childhood vaccination schedule along with those of other developed nations. The new US vaccine schedule resembles the schedule in Denmark.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo1rls0005336pt9aaxb4v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Children’s health depends on vaccine recommendations based on rigorous, transparent science,” American Academy of Pediatrics President Dr. Andrew Racine said in a statement Wednesday. “Unfortunately, recent decisions by federal officials have abandoned this standard, causing unnecessary confusion for families, compromising access to lifesaving vaccines and weakening community protection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo1rls0006336pay1nv3jx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The medical groups’ first request to a federal judge is to restore the vaccine schedule to where it was on April 15, 2025, before any changes were made by HHS under Kennedy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo1rls0007336pyje962vq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The second request is to stop ACIP from meeting at the end of February. The groups say the panel relies on “spurious evidence” to make its recommendations, and they are seeking to replace the members, saying Kennedy appointed advisers who lack the required experience and credentials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkepzanl00003b6sl47zh9j7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “AAP continues with their attempts to hinder this Administration’s work through procedural and legal challenges while trying to preserve a broken status quo,” HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement Wednesday. “ACIP continues to operate lawfully and transparently, and its next meeting is scheduled to proceed in February.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo1rls0008336ptzkndy6u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy removed all the previous ACIP members last year and replaced them with his own picks, many of whom share his skepticism of vaccines. He also ousted the CDC director, who typically signs off on the agency’s vaccine recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkepmoz400073b6s5etkyzlw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy appointed two more members to the vaccine panel on &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/secretary-kennedy-appoints-two-ob-gyns-cdc-advisory-committee-immunization-practices.html" target="_blank"&gt;Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. One of them, Dr. Kimberly Biss, an obstetrician/gynecologist, has &lt;a href="https://rumble.com/v2r9elx-ob-gyn-dr.-kimberly-biss-i-was-not-anti-vaccine-i-am-now.html" target="_blank"&gt;described herself&lt;/a&gt; as “anti-vaccine.” The other, Dr. Adam Urato, also an ob/gyn, has said on &lt;a href="https://x.com/AdamUrato1/status/1938322690185544005?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; that “the science is not ‘long-settled’ regarding vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo1rls000a336p9wqwrupc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When Kennedy’s newly reconstituted ACIP met last year, members voted to weaken recommendations for universal hepatitis B vaccination for newborns and to stop recommending certain flu vaccines that have thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that has been falsely linked to autism. The committee has said it will continue to reassess even long-established vaccine data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo1rls000c336p9f9rimbv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The efforts announced by the medical groups Wednesday are part of a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/33682" target="_blank"&gt;larger lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against HHS over ACIP and its changes to Covid-19 vaccine recommendations. HHS has made a motion to dismiss the suit, but Judge Brian Murphy rejected the request last week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo1rls000d336pfdo1x181@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A hearing on the preliminary injunction is scheduled for February 13.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease (HD) has long been impossible to cure, but new research is finally giving fresh hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HD is a progressive, hereditary brain disease that affects movement, cognition, and emotions. &lt;span&gt;Doctors often diagnose HD when people show clear movement problems, typically around 30-50 years of age, after which patients live about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5870025/"&gt;15-20 years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mds.29228#xd_co_f=ZGQ3ZjEzNTktMWE2NS00Njg4LWEzMDktMzViMDcwNTYwZGM5%7E"&gt;global prevalence&lt;/a&gt; of HD is about five per 100,000 people. While it is not as prevalent as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="188925" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, the disease starts &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590112520300244"&gt;much earlier&lt;/a&gt; in life, often when people are still working and raising families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-gene-therapy-slows-huntingtons-disease-by-75"&gt;Breakthrough Gene Therapy Slows Huntington's Disease by 75%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, there is no cure. But a couple of new research papers, by our team and others, suggest this may be about to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The causes of HD long remained a mystery since it was discovered in the 19th century. But &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/0092-8674(93)90585-E"&gt;in 1993&lt;/a&gt;, researchers uncovered that HD is caused by repetitive expansions of three DNA letters (C, A, and G) in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene, resulting in the production of a mutant huntingtin protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188950" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188950" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/dna_strand_huntingtin_642-1.jpg" alt="dna strand" class="wp-image-188950 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/dna_strand_huntingtin_642-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/dna_strand_huntingtin_642-1-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188950" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Huntington's disease is caused by repeating bases at the ends of a chromosome. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAG3JpLJPcA/"&gt;sasirin pamai's Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gene normally has a section that repeats the letters CAG over and over. In healthy people, the repeat is lower than 35. Repeat lengths greater than 39 will result in HD. The more repeats you have, the earlier symptoms usually start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to your inherited CAG length, this sequence tends to continually expand in certain cells over a person's lifetime, known as somatic expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, in 1993, the discovery generated lots of excitement. First, you could identify which relatives in a family with a history of the disease would develop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those of us working in HD clinics at the time were highly concerned about the ethical and mental health issues this also raised. There was a big need for counselling, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, it was thought, somewhat mistakenly, that very quickly there would be a treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many studies have investigated people with the HD gene expansion 15 years before onset, and some even as far as 25 years before onset. Even before the onset of movement problems, changes in cognition, mood, and the brain have been found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the brain changes &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21130037/"&gt;start in a part called the striatum&lt;/a&gt;, which helps control movement. Here, certain nerve cells (called GABAergic medium spiny neurons) die off. As HD gets worse, damage &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21130037/"&gt;spreads to other areas&lt;/a&gt;, like the cortex, which is important for cognition, and white matter, which connects brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188951" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188951" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/striatum_huntingtings_642.jpg" alt="striatum diagram" class="wp-image-188951 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/striatum_huntingtings_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/striatum_huntingtings_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188951" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Death of neurons in the striatum has been linked with Huntington's symptoms. (Dr_Microbe/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Progress at last&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only recently have there been some promising results in the treatment of HD by clinical researchers Sarah Tabrizi and Edward Wild at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the research is still waiting to be peer reviewed and published, the results &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj.r2029?hwshib2=authn%3A1764854446%3A20251203%253A4dc02f01-51cc-4daa-9bdd-b9cd303ef685%3A0%3A0%3A0%3AU72qy%2B4nUTZop8ODA36O2g%3D%3D"&gt;have been reported&lt;/a&gt; in a press release by uniQure, a US biotechnology company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this trial, &lt;span&gt;AMT-130 – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;a gene therapy that reduces the production of the toxic mutant huntingtin protein – was given to 29 HD patients between the ages of 25 and 65 who had a definitive clinical diagnosis. The results showed slower cognitive decline on standard neuropsychological tests, particularly in processing speed and reading ability. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most significantly for doctors, cerebrospinal fluid levels of a protein called neurofilament light, a general marker for neurodegeneration, were reduced after three years of follow-up, even below baseline levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This indicates that the therapy &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj.r2029?hwshib2=authn%3A1764854446%3A20251203%253A4dc02f01-51cc-4daa-9bdd-b9cd303ef685%3A0%3A0%3A0%3AU72qy%2B4nUTZop8ODA36O2g%3D%3D"&gt;may actively protect brain cells&lt;/a&gt; from damage rather than simply masking symptoms. It is hoped that, in the future, it will be possible to provide safe and effective treatments at earlier stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, people with the HD gene expansion will have improved cognition and emotion and reduced motor symptoms, which will improve quality of life and may even extend their lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huntingtons-breakthrough-may-not-be-the-success-it-seems-expert-cautions"&gt;Huntington's Breakthrough May Not Be The Success It Seems, Expert Cautions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a motivation for our new work, a collaboration between UCL and the University of Cambridge, for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32470422/"&gt;the HD- Young Adult Study&lt;/a&gt;. The study recruited 131 people: 64 with the HD gene expansion and 67 controls, long before predicted disease onset, approximately 24 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32470422/"&gt;gathered in-depth information&lt;/a&gt; about participants' cognition, mood, and behaviour, alongside brain scans and tests of blood and other fluids that can show how healthy their brain cells are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this early stage, we noted some increases in markers of neurodegeneration with limited effects on brain volume and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that the striatal circuits are disrupted early in HD, we wanted to determine whether cognitive flexibility, how easily people can swap between different approaches and perspectives, a function that relies on this circuitry, was affected at this very early stage in those with HD gene expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we showed some mild early disruption to cognitive flexibility, which was &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7841479/#R3"&gt;associated with alterations&lt;/a&gt; in the connectivity in these circuits. This cohort &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39825149/"&gt;was also followed up&lt;/a&gt; about 4.5 years later, where changes in many measures became more apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, in collaboration with the University of Glasgow, we showed that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39825149/"&gt;somatic expansion&lt;/a&gt;, how the CAG sequence tends to continually expand in certain cells over a person's lifetime, can give crucial information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was the first to show in living humans that the faster this somatic expansion, the faster the disease progresses. This can explain why some people who have identical inherited CAG length in the Huntingtin gene can still have different onset of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive deficits were apparent at this time, although they were in a specific cognitive process. &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70944"&gt;Our findings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70944" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;reveal early sustained attention deficits in people with expanded CAG sequences, which are associated with changes in brain circuits in the inferior frontal gyrus (involved in attention), well before movement was affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, this brain area is also linked to the inability of people with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="188925" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; to focus their attention, as we discovered in an &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24199662/"&gt;earlier study&lt;/a&gt;. This suggests that this disruption in sustained attention in HD may reflect a neurodevelopmental process rather than a neurodegenerative one at this early stage of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that there is a treatment window, potentially decades before motor symptoms are present, where those with the HD gene expansion are functioning normally despite having detectable measures of subtle early neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying these early markers of disease is essential for future  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="188925" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; in order to determine whether a treatment is having any effect and preserving the quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, as drugs that slow the worsening of the disease rather than treat the symptoms are approved by the regulatory bodies for HD, they could be implemented at an early stage to improve quality of life and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope that these now rapid advances in the understanding and treatment of HD will, in the near future, bring great benefits to patients.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/273376/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Using exercise to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vagus-nerve-stimulation-has-lasting-effects-in-people-with-severe-depression"&gt;treat depression&lt;/a&gt; can be as effective as therapy or antidepressants, according to a new review of previous trials, potentially offering an affordable and personalized approach to improving mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team led by researchers from the University of Lancashire in the UK analyzed 73 randomized, controlled trials involving a total of almost 5,000 adults. The studies covered a variety of different exercise regimes and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ketamine-can-treat-depression-as-effectively-as-electroconvulsive-therapy"&gt;depression treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the data showed that exercise can work as a way of easing the symptoms of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="188383" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, in line with findings from some &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-single-30-minute-exercise-session-has-an-immediate-antidepressant-effect"&gt;previous investigations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-link-gut-bacteria-to-bipolar-depression-in-mouse-study"&gt;Scientists Link Gut Bacteria to Bipolar Depression in Mouse Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, results vary to some extent between individuals and between exercise types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that exercise appears to be a safe and accessible option for helping to manage symptoms of depression," &lt;a href="https://www.cochrane.org/about-us/news/exercise-treat-depression-yields-similar-results-therapy-and-antidepressants"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Andrew Clegg, a professor of Health Services Research at the University of Lancashire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that exercise works well for some people, but not for everyone, and finding approaches that individuals are willing and able to maintain is important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188386" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188386" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/WomanExercising.jpg" alt="Woman exercising" class="wp-image-188386 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/WomanExercising.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/WomanExercising-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188386" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;It remains to be seen if some types of exercise work better than others at tackling depression. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-in-green-tank-top-and-black-leggings-doing-yoga-on-blue-round-trampoline-YxCrQm9XNgg"&gt;Gabin Vallet/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all of the trials, exercise was shown to be moderately beneficial &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-2-key-lifestyle-changes-can-treat-mild-depression-as-well-as-therapy"&gt;for treating depression&lt;/a&gt;, compared to no treatment at all. It was about on a par with psychological therapy, and (with a lesser degree of certainty) antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light to moderate exercise seemed to work better than &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-finds-potential-downside-to-vigorous-exercise-that-we-didnt-know-about"&gt;more vigorous activity&lt;/a&gt; when it came to alleviating symptoms of depression, the review found. Between 13 and 36 sessions appeared to be the sweet spot, though none of the trials tracked depression and exercise over a long period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was some evidence favoring the combination of different types of exercise, though no single activity type stood out as a clear winner. For exercise to provide benefits, it would need to be tailored to suit individual needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For people with depression, the evidence indicates that exercise may offer similar short-term benefits to therapy or medication for some," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-exercise-having-similar-results-as-therapy-for-treating-depression/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Brendon Stubbs, from King's College London, who wasn't involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Decisions on switching or combining approaches should be made collaboratively with healthcare providers, considering individual circumstances."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review focused mainly on structured trials, and while this is beneficial in terms of the comprehensiveness of the data that gets collected, these types of experiments tend to attract people who are naturally more motivated &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-fitness-accessory-makes-you-up-to-7-times-more-likely-to-stay-active"&gt;and active&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188384" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188384" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LonelyMan-642x361.jpg" alt="Lonely man" class="size-medium wp-image-188384" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LonelyMan-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LonelyMan-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LonelyMan-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LonelyMan.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188384" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Exercise works well for some people, but not for everyone.

                                    &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health said a travel-related Zika virus case has been confirmed on Oahu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is Hawaii’s first confirmed Zika case this year. Another travel-related Zika case was &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/05/28/breaking-news/doh-travel-related-zika-virus-case-confirmed-on-oahu/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in Hawaii, also on Oahu, in May of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said travel-associated cases were more frequently reported in Hawaii between 2015 to 2019, when Zika was circulating globally, and peaked at 25 cases in 2017. To date, no locally acquired cases have been documented in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/zika-virus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Zika &lt;/a&gt;virus – like dengue — spreads primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito. While Hawaii has the mosquito species capable of transmitting Zika, the virus is not established in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be spread through sex, or to a fetus during pregnancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – and infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects and is linked to complications, including miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms of Zika include fever, rash, headache, red eyes and joint and muscle pain. Many people infected with Zika, however, will have no symptoms or only have mild symptoms, CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, DOH also confirmed another travel-related case of dengue on Oahu, which will be counted as the 15th case of dengue in Hawaii in 2025 based on when the symptoms began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of dengue include fever, rash, nausea, vomiting and aches and pains, including eye pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are not related to one another, according to DOH, and affected individuals were exposed while traveling in regions where the viruses are known to circulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”DOH teams have been deployed to conduct outreach, inspections and implement mosquito control measures in the affected areas,” the department said. “Because both Zika and dengue are transmitted by mosquitoes that exist locally, controlling mosquito populations in the affected areas is critical to preventing spread.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said it would continue to monitor mosquito numbers in the affected areas, but did not disclose what parts of Oahu were impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC advises travelers to check Zika and dengue risk information before departure. Anyone experiencing symptoms within two weeks after visiting an area with risk of Zika or dengue should consult their doctors and inform them of possible exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health care providers and anyone who suspect Zika or dengue infection should also call the Disease Reporting Line at 808-586-4586.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;A measles outbreak in South Carolina that began in October is now wildly accelerating, doubling in just the past week to a total of &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak"&gt;434 cases&lt;/a&gt;, with 409 people currently in quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the outbreak, South Carolina health officials have been providing updates on cases every Tuesday and Friday. On Tuesday, state health officials reported &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-124-new-measles-cases-upstate-new-public-exposures-and"&gt;124 more cases&lt;/a&gt; since last Friday, which had &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/measles-continues-raging-in-south-carolina-99-new-cases-since-tuesday/"&gt;99 new cases&lt;/a&gt; since the previous Tuesday. On that day, January 6, officials noted a more modest increase of 26 cases, bringing the outbreak total at that point to &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-26-new-measles-cases-upstate-bringing-outbreak-total-211"&gt;211 cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the 3-month-old outbreak now doubled in just a week, health officials are renewing calls for people to get vaccinated against the highly infectious virus—an effort that has met with little success since October. Still, the health department is activating its mobile health unit to offer free measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinations, as well as flu vaccinations at two locations today and Thursday in the Spartanburg area, the epicenter of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials are also warning that they’re losing the ability to trace cases, and exposures are continuing. Last Friday, someone contagious with measles was in the South Carolina State Museum in Columbia between 1 pm and 5 pm ET. Anyone in the museum during that time and unvaccinated is at risk of contracting the infection. The virus spreads through the air and can linger in a room’s airspace for up to two hours after an infected person has left. Measles is so contagious that up to 90 percent of unvaccinated people exposed will fall ill.&lt;/p&gt;

The virus has driven a wave of illness and hospitalizations in countries such as the United Kingdom, Italy and the United States, where “suddenly everybody is seeing not just cases, but high numbers of cases”, says Andrew Pekosz, a virologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland. In many nations, the flu season started earlier and accelerated faster than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03608-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00061-6/d41586-026-00061-6_51697274.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;A universal flu vaccine has proved challenging — could it finally be possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why is this flu season so bad? Scientists suspect that it is in part due to a &lt;a href="https://nextstrain.org/seasonal-flu/h3n2/ha/2y?label=Subclade:K" data-track="click" data-label="https://nextstrain.org/seasonal-flu/h3n2/ha/2y?label=Subclade:K" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;new strain of the influenza virus that has risen to dominance&lt;/a&gt;. The variant has a high number of key mutations, which means that it is much less similar to the strain used in the flu vaccine than previous seasons’ viruses have been. This might make it easier for the virus to shrug off the immune system and vaccines. Furthermore, the dominant strain belongs to a viral subtype that has been circulating for decades but was not dominant in the past few flu seasons, meaning that many people have relatively weak immunity against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, there is &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/early-estimates-seasonal-influenza-vaccine-effectiveness-against-influenza-requiring" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/early-estimates-seasonal-influenza-vaccine-effectiveness-against-influenza-requiring" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; to suggest that currently available flu vaccines offer protection against severe illness&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, it’s too early in the flu season “to say exactly how this one will stack up compared to [others] over the last few decades”, says Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington. But “this is a worse than average flu season, that’s for sure”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A year for H3N2&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2025–26 flu season started a month earlier than expected in the United Kingdom, much of Europe and Japan, which &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03367-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03367-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;declared a flu epidemic because of the unexpectedly high number of infections&lt;/a&gt;. Australia’s flu season continued for at least a month longer than usual&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In Canada, “all provinces and territories saw a massive increase in the number of cases, all at the same time”, says Eleni Galanis, a director general at the Public Health Agency of Canada in Ottawa. “And that, of course, puts a lot of pressure on the health-care system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus causing many of this year’s cases is an example of the H3N2 subtype, which evolves faster than other strains&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A variant of the H3N2 virus called subclade K became globally dominant in September and now accounts for about 80% of influenza infections worldwide. “Everything can be attributed to this clade K variant,” Pekosz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine mismatch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modelling suggests that subclade K emerged &lt;a href="https://nextstrain.org/seasonal-flu/h3n2/ha/2y?label=Subclade:K" data-track="click" data-label="https://nextstrain.org/seasonal-flu/h3n2/ha/2y?label=Subclade:K" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;as early as February last year&lt;/a&gt;.

The study has not yet been peer reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More mutations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Created by a Japanese expert, the fitness routine has social media influencers of all ages raving about its health benefits on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube. The New York Times also named it one of its "10 fitness tips to help you get moving in 2026."&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h2&gt;Interval walking training&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;The "Japanese Walking" method consists of fast and slow walks in three minute intervals. First, you walk briskly with large strides. And next, you walk slowly for three minutes at a pace where you can hold a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Its creator recommends repeating this cycle at least five times, and doing this routine a minimum of four times a week. This method is also called interval walking training, or IWT.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;
    
                    &lt;p&gt;Teo says he always asks himself if the content he is thinking about making is something his mother could do.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;He explains, "They're the people who are probably at the highest risk of injuries and detriments to their health, who don't have the skill set or the knowledge or the tools available to them to be able to improve their health."&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;figure class="p-article__img -full"&gt;
                                &lt;img src="/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/4530/images/XydElwMJAQsJYHZrSVcVPV117ahzM12c2I5DUQq1.jpg" alt=""&gt;
                                &lt;figcaption&gt;Teo and his mother&lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
    
                    &lt;p&gt;He was searching for exercise methods for people of all ages when he discovered a report on interval walking by Japanese researchers. He says it was exactly what he needed.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h2&gt;Better than 10,000 steps&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;In his now viral video, Teo introduces the "Japanese Walking" method by saying: "You've probably heard that you should walk 10,000 steps a day. But in 2007, Japanese researchers discovered a walking technique that gives you 10 times the benefits in just 30 minutes."&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Teo says: "It makes a lot of sense from a mechanistic cardio metabolic standpoint. And it was really cool to see research backing it up, as to here is the protocol you can start to use. And I love just how accessible it was."&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;To pay respect to the Japanese researchers, he dubbed the method "Japanese Walking."&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Teo credits the name as a reason for why his video went viral.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;He says: "I think people just on some level understand that there is a very specific, unique way that Japanese people do things. It is very thorough. It is very detail oriented."&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;figure class="p-article__img -full"&gt;
                                &lt;img src="/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/4530/images/tKTGtM7jxfoDE6ATg6kqg20w5JITrNsqDALwileE.jpg" alt=""&gt;
                                &lt;figcaption&gt;Teo's video on 'Japanese Walking' is shared and liked by thousands on social media.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
    
                    &lt;p&gt;Praised for being simple, practical and gym-free, the method soon drew attention. People began posting videos of themselves going "Japanese Walking."&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Global media, such as Fortune, Time, The New York Times and The Washington Post, also published features on the burgeoning fitness trend.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h2&gt;Japanese experts continue efforts&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;The creator of "Japanese Walking" is Nose Hiroshi, a specially appointed professor at Shinshu University in Matsumoto City, Nagano Prefecture. He researched the method as a way for elderly people to maintain their physical strength.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;He says it is important to do 60 minutes of fast walking a week to strengthen muscles and boost endurance. His research team also found that this exercise is effective for improving memory.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;figure class="p-article__img -full"&gt;
                                &lt;img src="/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/4530/images/daRl0MI0ptWra9e0V5d9S5oergJr2lmyohLT4WyL.jpg" alt=""&gt;
                                &lt;figcaption&gt;Nose Hiroshi on NHK World's Medical Frontiers program.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
    
                    &lt;p&gt;Nose's collaborative researcher, Professor Masuki Shizue, ran studies on the exercise and says it may help lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of a stroke and combat depression. She also found it effective for improving or maintaining bone density.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Masuki's team has also developed an online system that allows people to see how this exercise routine will improve their health. By entering information like age, body weight, blood pressure and how long they will continue this exercise, people can see how their bodies will transform.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;As this research and innovation continues in Japan, the growing trend of "Japanese Walking" is changing the lives of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Stiff knees, aching hips, and the slow grind of chronic joint pain are often accepted as an unavoidable part of getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while osteoarthritis is the world's most common joint disease, experts say the way we treat and prevent it is badly out of step with the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best medicine isn't found in a pill bottle or an operating theatre – it's movement. Yet across countries and health systems, too few patients are being guided toward the one therapy proven to protect their joints and ease their pain: &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/exercise-670"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-breakthrough-to-restore-aging-joints-could-help-treat-osteoarthritis"&gt;New Breakthrough to Restore Aging Joints Could Help Treat Osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is one of the most effective treatments for chronic, disabling joint conditions &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-are-the-key-risk-factors-for-developing-knee-osteoarthritis-we-reviewed-the-evidence-253722"&gt;such as osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;. Yet very few patients actually receive it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research across health systems in &lt;a href="http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11227783/"&gt;Ireland, the UK, Norway&lt;/a&gt;, and the United States shows the same pattern: fewer than half of people with osteoarthritis are referred to exercise or physiotherapy by their primary care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 60 percent are given treatments that guidelines do not recommend, and around 40 percent are sent to a surgeon before &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/do-you-have-knee-pain-from-osteoarthritis-you-might-not-need-surgery-heres-what-to-try-instead-236779"&gt;non-surgical options&lt;/a&gt; have even been tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why those figures are so troubling, it helps to understand what exercise does for joints. Osteoarthritis is by far the most common form of arthritis, already affecting more than 595 million people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(23)00163-7/fulltext"&gt;global study in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that number could approach one billion by 2050. Longer life expectancy, increasingly sedentary lifestyles, and rising numbers of overweight or obese people are driving the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet people who exercise regularly are physically and biologically protecting themselves from developing the disease and from suffering its worst effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cartilage that covers the ends of our bones is a tough, protective layer with no blood supply of its own. It relies on movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a sponge, cartilage is compressed when we walk or load a joint, squeezing fluid out and then drawing fresh nutrients back in. Each step allows nutrients and natural lubricants to circulate and maintain joint health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why the old idea of osteoarthritis as simple "wear and tear" is misleading. Joints are not car tires that inevitably grind down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis is better understood as a long process of wear and repair in which regular movement and exercise are critical to healing and to the health of the entire joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177108" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/WomenHoldingOntoHandLikeItsInPain-e1760056845637.jpg" alt="women holding onto her other hand like she's in pain" class="wp-image-177108 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177108" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Osteoarthritis impacts the whole joint region. (SimpleImages/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A disease of the whole joint&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now know osteoarthritis is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3295952/"&gt;whole-joint disease&lt;/a&gt;. It affects the joint fluid, the underlying bone, the ligaments, the surrounding muscles, and even the nerves that support movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic exercise targets all these elements. Muscle weakness, for instance, is one of the earliest signs of osteoarthritis and can be improved with resistance training. There is strong &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889857X12001299?via%3Dihub"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that muscle weakness increases the risk of both developing the disease and seeing it progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nerve and muscle control can also be trained through &lt;a href="https://www.jospt.org/doi/full/10.2519/jospt.2025.13041"&gt;neuromuscular exercise&lt;/a&gt; programs &lt;a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-017-1439-y"&gt;such as GLA:D®&lt;/a&gt; (Good Life with osteoArthritis: Denmark) for hip and knee osteoarthritis. Usually delivered in supervised group sessions by physiotherapists, these programs focus on movement quality, balance, and strength to improve joint stability and rebuild confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant improvements in pain, joint function, and quality of life &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1063458421000339"&gt;have been recorded&lt;/a&gt; for up to 12 months after completing the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/do-your-knees-click-heres-what-it-means-and-when-to-see-a-doctor"&gt;Do Your Knees 'Click'? Here's What It Means, And When to See a Doctor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is good medicine for the whole body: it has documented benefits across more than &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26606383/"&gt;26 chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt;. In osteoarthritis, it helps not only by strengthening cartilage and muscle but also by tackling the inflammation, metabolic changes, and hormonal shifts that drive the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2596954/"&gt;major risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for osteoarthritis, and not merely because of the extra mechanical load on joints. High levels of inflammatory molecules in the blood and in joint tissues can degrade cartilage and accelerate disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For osteoarthritis, regular activity can counter this at a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9110817/#S1"&gt;molecular level&lt;/a&gt;, lowering inflammatory markers, limiting cell damage, and even altering gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise first, surgery later&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently there are no drugs that modify the course of osteoarthritis. Joint replacement surgery can be life-changing for some people, but it is major surgery and does not succeed for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise should be tried first and continued throughout every stage of the disease. It carries far fewer side effects and brings many additional health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Osteoarthritis is not simply a matter of "worn-out" joints. It is shaped by muscle strength, inflammation, metabolism, and lifestyle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular, targeted exercise addresses many of these factors at once – helping to protect cartilage, strengthen the whole joint and improve overall health. Before considering surgery, movement itself remains one of the most powerful treatments we have.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260638/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Her family said that she was taken to McKay Dee Hospital, where she was diagnosed with the flu and adenovirus. Adenovirus has similar symptoms to the cold and flu and is also highly contagious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her family added that the flu had gone around the family, starting around Christmas. At the beginning, Ellie was doing OK and seemed to be battling the flu pretty well. The entire family had similar symptoms, but Ellie developed a concerning cough, and Sarah Rudd, her mom, took her to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I took her in, (and) they kept her overnight because her oxygen was pretty low,” Sarah said, adding that they were preparing to be discharged until Ellie’s oxygen dropped again. Overnight, her condition worsened and she developed pneumonia and sepsis, requiring her to be life-flighted to Primary Children’s Hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A team of doctors worked to try to increase Ellie’s oxygen levels and blood pressure while she was in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think she was about four days in the PICU, and they took her in for a CAT scan the day that she died and saw that she had a stroke,” Sarah said. “They wouldn’t be able to fix it, so we made the decision to take her off life support, and she passed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg.jpg" class="fancybox"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg.jpg" alt="Elora 'Ellie' Ann Rudd, a 4-year-old from Utah, passed away recently due to complications from the flu. | Courtesy GoFundMe" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-803945" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg.jpg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg-300x200.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg-860x573.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg-750x500.jpg 750w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Elora ‘Ellie’ Ann Rudd, a 4-year-old from Utah, passed away recently due to complications from the flu. | Courtesy GoFundMe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sarah and Michael, Ellie’s parents, are now speaking on their daughter’s life and how much she means to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We named her after the character from (the film) ‘Willow’, the little baby. She was very much a nurturing little girl; she loved her baby dolls,” Sarah said. “She loved to put them to bed at night, put them down for naps. She loved Barbies. She loved ‘One Hundred and One Dalmatians’, and ‘Frozen’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sarah went on, “She was the sweetest little girl alive and would always come home from preschool and give me a present that she created in preschool. She was in school for speech therapy. … She was making bounds and leaps this year for it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael Rudd, Sarah’s father, said that Ellie was “always very sweet, always very sharing, very loving and affectionate.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“She loved to have dance parties in her sister’s room all the time. They would go and turn off all the lights and get dressed up,” Sarah added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, the Rudds say they have more questions than answers, and one of those questions is most prominent in Sarah’s mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I just wonder, ‘Why her?’… I don’t know why it hit Ellie so hard,” Sarah said. The Rudds’ oldest daughter also caught pneumonia and bronchitis while the family was sick and was hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, their oldest is doing better, but the Rudd family is still left with the hole left by Ellie’s loss.

Berkeley’s Public Health Officer recommended that encampment residents move out of the area as soon as possible, and relocate to at least a third of a mile away due to public health risk caused by the rat infestation transmitting the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;"The absence of confirmed human cases is reassuring but does not remove the risk of undiagnosed cases or future cases," Noemi Doohan, Berkeley’s Public Health Officer said in a Jan. 6 court filing. "If a human case were confirmed, that would elevate the urgency of the recommended response to protect human life and other animal life in the city of Berkeley."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;The city advises dog owners to vaccinate their pets against leptospirosis, and the wrote the owners of "free roaming cats" should consider the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;Signs of pet illness may include "excessive thirst, vomiting, shivering, and lethargy, and can progress to liver failure if untreated. Lepto can also be fatal to dogs."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;In humans, leptospirosis can cause sudden high fever, throbbing headache, severe calf/leg pain, and red eyes (conjunctivitis), the court documents state. Without treatment the disease can cause kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, trouble breathing, and even death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;The disease may not be immediately recognizable by doctors either, as it is usually associated with tropical conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-6c8e215c&gt;Problem area&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;Rats and their urine are a common vector for the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;"Current Harrison Street encampment conditions (tents, refuse, uncontained foods, RVs, standing water) prevent standard vector control teams from accessing and destroying rat nesting sites," the city alert states. "Rodent eradication, ongoing rat testing for leptospirosis, and remediation of the area to prevent a growing rat infestation is a medical and public health safety necessity that cannot be successfully completed while the encampment is occupied by temporary dwellings, people and dogs."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;In addition to pushing for Harrison Street residents to relocate, the city is also encouraging residents to take precautions by avoiding touching the water in Codornices Creek or walking or biking through standing water in the area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;The creek has not been tested for leptospirosis, but noted that the presence of the disease so close to the creek means there is a significant risk of the disease spreading to the creek and wildlife if the infected rodent population is not brought under control. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;Veterinarians treating sick dogs at the Harrison Street encampment first identified the disease in November, and Alameda County Vector Control confirmed the presence of leptospirosis by trapping and testing rats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;"This was of particular concern because testing of rats trapped at encampment over the last five years… had never previously produced any findings of leptospirosis in rats," the city’s health advisory states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-6c8e215c&gt;What's next&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;Berkeley city staff have launched an ongoing public health investigation into the disease’s spread in the encampment and the nearby community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;Cleanup will take at least 30 days — the length of time leptospirosis can live in soil — and the eradication of rats requires "many cycles of baiting the rats with poison in their underground burrows, removing the carcasses, and rebaiting over time," the advisory states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;The city is &lt;a href="https://www.ktvu.com/news/federal-judge-orders-city-berkeley-temporarily-halt-removal-encampment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;barred by a federal injunction&lt;/a&gt; from clearing the Harrison Street encampment, which has blocked the city from "implementing fully effective eradication efforts," in stopping the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p data-uid="fts-ar-17" class="vendor-unit" data-v-6c8e215c&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KTVU</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 21:55:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNZHg1RmVhbGdxaVlrY1ZBTHVTVjgtOE5yamdlalNXSmF5SXNVMzZUa1c2MmdOVEgtWUd1TEZSWmI3S2JxUE5PckxqSENBQkpRdVc1dE1xUWdVSXFyQjZNU0V3NFlsQXh0T0I3ajU0aDdPY0g2aUh2MGZ5RnVORDdBSFM3aVpCbDlsUHdQeDBkWE0tcnJPOFHSAZsBQVVfeXFMTUw4cnN6REdhRDRyeVZ1NkVtaldPcU50ZEVQMDNtQmlEcW9zWWpaRzBXSWY0dFZ0VUt0OUhyX3I2N25DUm13ZmM4cElBdEVZckxVMjRsYWZFczJySEg2VjN1Mlh3ekhRaDJlOTUyOUlueUY3Y1ZvUzJCTHIwb09ySy1meUJnVnBhOTU1c2l2cFZNOHpYODdWU3dObjQ</guid></item><item><title>在洛杉矶发现的新型XDR志贺氏菌株- CIDRAP</title><link>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship/novel-xdr-shigella-strain-identified-los-angeles</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antimicrobial-stewardship-and-healthcare-epidemiology/article/emergence-of-a-novel-genotype-of-extensively-drugresistant-shigella-sonnei-carrying-bladha1-in-diverse-patient-populations-los-angeles-20242025/25182B42316C650A12B6F782C73A221E"&gt;case report&lt;/a&gt; published yesterday in &lt;em&gt;Antimicrobial Stewardship &amp;amp; Healthcare Epidemiology&lt;/em&gt; describes the identification of a novel strain of extensively drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;Shigella&lt;/em&gt; in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strain of XDR &lt;em&gt;Shigella sonnei&lt;/em&gt; was isolated separately from two patients in Los Angeles with no known epidemiologic connection or transmission route a year apart, researchers from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) David Geffen School of Medicine reported. One patient was a 34-year-old man with advanced HIV and a history of substance abuse, the other a 33-year-old immunocompromised woman with high-grade B-cell lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shigellosis is a highly infectious gastrointestinal condition caused by one of the four species of Shigella bacteria: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;S sonnei, S flexneri, S boydii,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;S dysenteriae&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's transmitted by the oral-fecal route; via contaminated fomites, food, and water; or by direct person-to-person contact. Symptoms range from mild diarrhea to severe dysentery. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolates from both patients were resistant to several oral antibiotics commonly used to treat shigellosis, along with other antibiotic classes. Molecular analysis identified the resistance gene &lt;em&gt;bla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;DHA-1&lt;/sub&gt;, which confers resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics,&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;in isolates from both patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolates from the immunocompromised patient also carried the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene &lt;em&gt;bla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M-15&lt;/sub&gt;, which has been found in XDR &lt;em&gt;S sonnei&lt;/em&gt; strains acquired through sexual transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) in US cities. A previous study by the same researchers identified a unique strain of XDR &lt;em&gt;S sonnei&lt;/em&gt; carrying the CTX-M gene spreading among MSM in Los Angeles. Recent studies have also documented the spread of XDR &lt;em&gt;Shigella&lt;/em&gt; strains in other high-risk populations, such as the unhoused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study say XDR &lt;em&gt;Shigella &lt;/em&gt;isolates carrying both resistance genes have not been reported before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The clinical implications of this are significant given that dual cephalosporinase producers may exhibit higher resistance than the more typical CTX-M–associated XDR &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shigella,”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; they wrote. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Concerns about broader spread&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most shigellosis cases are self-limiting, but antibiotics are frequently used to treat more-severe symptoms and to reduce shedding, which can help limit transmission. In 2023, however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship/cdc-warns-increase-extensively-drug-resistant-shigellosis"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in a health advisory that cases of XDR &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shigella&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; were rising in the United States. CDC data showed that the percentage of XDR &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shigella&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; isolates collected in the United States rose from 0% in 2015 to 5% in 2022.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another significant finding from the report was that molecular analysis showed that isolates from both patients had a close genetic relationship and a common ancestor, even though the two patients lived 80 miles from one another, and their visits did not overlap at the institution. There were also no known outbreaks of foodborne &lt;em&gt;Shigella&lt;/em&gt; at the time the two cases were identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corresponding report author Shangxin Yang, PhD, who directs the UCLA Molecular Microbiology and Pathogen Genomics Laboratory, said the biggest message of the report is that XDR &lt;em&gt;Shigella&lt;/em&gt; appears to be spreading beyond MSM and other high-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Based on my genomic analysis it seems to be a different strain just emerging recently, meaning there two different kinds of XDR &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shigella&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; circulating simultaneously, with one strain still actively circulating among the MSM population, but the new strain (remotely related to the MSM-circulating strain) spreading in a more general population,” Yang told CIDRAP News.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s a concern, Yang said, because broader spread could lead to more treatment failure, since the strains are “pretty much resistant to all oral drugs.” Both patients in the report required intravenous treatment with carbapenem antibiotics, which are a last-resort option for invasive infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yang and his colleagues say the situation warrants close monitoring and continuous genomic surveillance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
