He had a cancer normally associated &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14703051/organs-failing-die-habit-americans-loyda-cordero-galiero.html"&gt;with heavy tobacco use.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet his last chest scan just two years earlier had been completely clear, leading his medical team to believe vaping may have played a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because the tumor had spread into the tissue surrounding his heart, surgery was ruled out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He began chemotherapy, but the disease progressed rapidly and he died just three months after his diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His case, published in the American Journal of Case Reports, is thought to be the first to suggest a possible link between vaping and cancer in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Leonardo DiCaprio and Cara Delevingne are among the celebrities known to vape on occasion &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier studies had only demonstrated such associations in lab animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors from AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center in Atlantic City, who treated him, wrote: 'While causality cannot be established, the case highlights a potential association between e-cigarette use and malignancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects of e-cigarettes and their possible role in lung cancer development and progression.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although there have been a handful of prior cancer cases involving people who vape, many of those patients were older and had long histories of smoking tobacco, making it difficult to isolate the effects of vaping alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr James Finigan, a pulmonologist who specializes in treating lung nodules and lung cancer, told the Daily Mail: 'Though the long term effects of vaping are still being studied, there is evidence that the risk of cancer is four fold higher in those who have vaped and smoked cigarettes compared to those who have only smoked cigarettes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The New Jersey patient had quit traditional cigarettes more than a decade earlier before turning to e-cigarettes and was relatively young, with a faster-than-expected clinical decline and no response to chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team wrote: 'While definitive conclusions cannot be drawn, our patient's younger age, limited combustible tobacco smoking history, rapid tumor growth, lack of response to chemotherapy, and accelerated clinical decline raise the possibility of a distinct or more aggressive disease pattern. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These differences prompt consideration of potential contributing factors, including the prolonged use of ENDS [electronic cigarettes].'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;E-cigarettes produce an aerosol by heating a liquid that usually contains nicotine, flavorings, and a mixture of toxic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When inhaled, this vapor can deliver harmful substances deep into the lungs, including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and other volatile organic compounds known to cause cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These substances can damage lung tissue and over time, this damage can lead to DNA mutations and inflammation which increase the risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this case, the patient's tumor occupied roughly two-thirds of his left lung by the time it was detected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests revealed he had squamous cell carcinoma (SSC) — a form of cancer that accounts for roughly 20 to 30 percent of all lung cancer diagnoses in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are around 226,000 new cases annually, the vast majority of whom are men and long-term smokers.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SCC is often considered a 'silent killer' because it may not cause obvious symptoms in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When signs do appear, they are frequently mistaken for less serious conditions — such as allergies, bronchitis, or asthma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If caught early, SCC has a five-year survival rate of around 50 percent. But once it spreads beyond the lungs, that figure drops to just seven percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The New Jersey patient was initially discharged after diagnosis, with plans to begin treatment on an outpatient basis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But within two weeks, he returned to the hospital in severe pain. The tumor had grown so large it was compressing his airways and making it difficult to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors inserted a stent to help open his lungs, and he was prescribed radiation and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the cancer continued to spread, and he died within two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors of the report are now calling for more research into the cancer risks associated with e-cigarette use, particularly as more long-term users age into the window when cancer typically appears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also suggest updating cancer screening criteria to include chronic vapers — especially those with more than 10 years of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As for adult vaping, a study in JAMA recently found Oklahoma topped the list &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Early detection in this instance might have facilitated timely intervention and improved the clinical outcome,' the doctors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Future research should investigate whether e-cigarette use is an emerging risk factor worth considering in lung cancer screening programs.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Finigan added: 'Identifying lung cancer early, either through screening or through appropriately identifying and managing incidentally identified lung nodules, is the most effective way to reduce overall lung cancer mortality.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 16 million American adults — about 6.5 percent of the U.S. population — currently use e-cigarettes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highest rates are seen in young adults aged 18 to 24, with more than 15 percent in that group reporting regular use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among children, about 1.6 million middle and high school students still vape, though usage has declined since its peak in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 23:07:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxNVUdyZW54emRHOEFZeWx6eGpfWFRMVUEzOEtfRzVvY2JZYlNESlB1eDFLajlVV1QxRlItTEdPS1o5Nng0RV9pZVJrbndlcG1YaUowaERvR1J3MmpLZVY3WlJHR2RaaU1KQUNaNjZYNXl5X2FleXoxcTN2c1hnVXdkc1UyZTk3UVluNi1BbGxlTVZZQnNQNzNrMUJnakM4Z05jcUtqWXhPRUpMZi1PZURrY1poWG1FZlE3M0NIR1FTclNOeGhaRFg4MHZR</guid></item><item><title>在青少年之前接受放疗，脑癌诊断后的化疗- Bring Me The News | Prior Lake teen to undergo radiation, chemo after brain cancer diagnosis - Bring Me The News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNejBmdjRBNTZYLUF6UGk5OGFXWkw4N3JUZEdVNS1SenduU0RSR194S0lnWTlDMnBTUFp5YzVUNWE3LWJ3Wk1nZnhad2szSnp3bFp4eV9KSWEtaVFMcUdCZWFuZ1hrWmtSbjBMYS1kU2dhenozekVERnRWTm95YVloRl9JTUF6dm1PY1pMWnRhM2pDdWxUd1pCMkpOeDNJMG1LQjhXX3NCZ1NnR2s3d1V1OFBTNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bring Me The News</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 22:33:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNejBmdjRBNTZYLUF6UGk5OGFXWkw4N3JUZEdVNS1SenduU0RSR194S0lnWTlDMnBTUFp5YzVUNWE3LWJ3Wk1nZnhad2szSnp3bFp4eV9KSWEtaVFMcUdCZWFuZ1hrWmtSbjBMYS1kU2dhenozekVERnRWTm95YVloRl9JTUF6dm1PY1pMWnRhM2pDdWxUd1pCMkpOeDNJMG1LQjhXX3NCZ1NnR2s3d1V1OFBTNA</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，使用大麻可能会使心脏病死亡的风险增加一倍-《卫报》 | Cannabis use could double risk of heart deaths, study suggests - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxNekpyU2FySUYwS2kxX2k1MDV2ajU5YmRLc0ZjN0Z2b2tmdUl3M1hyN2Iwcm9VaTdHMlplbnRzc2RtT21XcHBXbW9MbmRHTW9CQllaeGJsWlpaZVRTcnFtR2Jrc1VGNnR5bS0wNHFWSjlFRzlNekw5SWgzQWV5dnRjLXhQSENfbUZ5VEJOVnN6TkljckNPVTdzQ2p6SUlNRXFGMW1yQV9vZjV5aTkxeHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cannabis use may double the risk of dying from heart disease and increase the risk of stroke by 20%, according to a global review of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The number of people using cannabis and cannabinoids has soared over the past decade.

And in those studies where sex was recorded, cannabis users tended to be mostly male and younger than non-users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The analysis revealed heightened risks for cannabis use: 29% higher for acute coronary syndrome; 20% higher for stroke; and a doubling in the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.

Cannabis is now generally more potent and has diversified into a wide array of inhaled high potency cannabis concentrates, synthetic psychoactive cannabinoids, and edibles, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;They wrote: “How these changes affect cardiovascular risk requires clarification, as does the proportion of risk attributable to cannabinoids themselves versus particulate matter, terpenes or other components of the exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Cannabis needs to be incorporated into the framework for prevention of clinical cardiovascular disease. So too must cardiovascular disease prevention be incorporated into the regulation of cannabis markets. Effective product warnings and education on risks must be developed, required, and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Cardiovascular and other health risks must be considered in the regulation of allowable product and marketing design as the evidence base grows. Today that regulation is focused on establishing the legal market with woeful neglect of minimising health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Specifically, cannabis should be treated like tobacco: not criminalised, but discouraged, with protection of bystanders from secondhand exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNekpyU2FySUYwS2kxX2k1MDV2ajU5YmRLc0ZjN0Z2b2tmdUl3M1hyN2Iwcm9VaTdHMlplbnRzc2RtT21XcHBXbW9MbmRHTW9CQllaeGJsWlpaZVRTcnFtR2Jrc1VGNnR5bS0wNHFWSjlFRzlNekw5SWgzQWV5dnRjLXhQSENfbUZ5VEJOVnN6TkljckNPVTdzQ2p6SUlNRXFGMW1yQV9vZjV5aTkxeHc</guid></item><item><title>事实证明，大麻提取物在杀死世界上最危险的动物方面非常有效- Earth.com | Cannabis extract proves to be highly effective at killing the most dangerous animals in the world - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNcUVKQTh4OTlQNG1VVWFqV3pZYkFDNnp6SE1uZmhMV2dGNUJBam9uOWpBYURJOFhrN3V6di0tSks1YUJvb2tJTU5vcVV0cktjUUgzd1B2RXhHSnFwa2lrbklXNjB3Nk5wSEZvYUprcVdqZzhCOVJWUE1YMVktMVRLYkg3eUpXeEhrdUtGNFcxTkNJTjlKN0RsSzR3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, mosquito-borne diseases cut short more than a million lives across the globe, outpacing every other animal threat to humanity. The rising toll has public-health teams scrambling for fresh combat tools, especially as traditional chemical sprays lose their edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That loss stems from two hard truths. First, the very &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7692614/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pyrethroid insecticides&lt;/a&gt; that once worked wonders now linger in soil and water, nudging delicate ecosystems off balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, mosquitoes adapt fast. Larvae soaking in tainted puddles and adults drifting through treated neighborhoods increasingly shrug off doses that once killed them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mosquito-repellents-that-actually-work-yes-thanks-to-ai-machine-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Controlling the pests&lt;/a&gt; at their waterborne stage is vital, yet options that stay potent without harming everything else remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-cbd-and-mosquitoes"&gt;Cannabis, CBD, and mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Insects&lt;/em&gt; points to a solution hiding in plain sight: the hemp plant, &lt;em&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After air-drying and grinding ordinary hemp leaves, scientists at &lt;a href="https://www.osu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt; led by Erick Martinez Rodriguez extracted &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-reduces-the-unwanted-side-effects-of-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabidiol (CBD)&lt;/a&gt; and added the concentrate to cups of water teeming with yellow fever mosquito larvae. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within 48 hours, both a strain that laughs at &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rising-temperatures-could-make-insect-repellents-less-effective/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;common insecticides&lt;/a&gt; and a non-resistant strain were wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mosquitoes are one of the deadliest animals in the world, mainly because as adults they serve as vectors of disease,” Rodriguez explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-resistance-to-vulnerability"&gt;From resistance to vulnerability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two important findings jumped out. The first was total mortality: every mosquito larva exposed to sufficient CBD died by the two-day mark, regardless of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-learn-how-mosquitoes-use-sound-to-outsmart-and-evade-human-defenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;its genetic armor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second was efficiency. While industrial chemicals often push resistance higher with every generation, CBD’s effect cut straight through those defenses. Doses varied, but even modest concentrations proved lethal to all mosquito larvae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you compare the amount of hemp extract needed to kill 50 % of the population to other synthetic conventional insecticides, it is on the high side, but when you compare it side by side to other natural extracts we have tested in our lab, only a relatively low amount is required to produce high mortality values in larvae,” said Martinez Rodriguez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-cbd-kills-mosquitoes"&gt;How CBD kills mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemical sleuthing showed that CBD dominated the hemp extract, and terpene fractions did little damage on their own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larvae were judged dead once they stopped moving under a gentle nudge, confirming the cannabinoid’s direct impact on vital systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insects lack the endocannabinoid receptors that give &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-can-help-ease-chronic-pain-anxiety-and-mood-disorders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CBD its wellness reputation&lt;/a&gt; among humans, so the compound must strike different molecular targets – possibly ion channels that govern nerve impulses or enzymes tied to muscle control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the route, CBD skirts the metabolic tricks that shield many larvae from pyrethroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hemp-economics-meet-public-health"&gt;Hemp economics meet public health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemp is no niche crop. U.S. farmers planted about 27,680 acres in 2023, and the total value of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hemp-seeds-could-be-a-game-changer-as-an-alternative-protein-source/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hemp products&lt;/a&gt; topped $291 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaves, often left as low-value waste after flowers and seeds are harvested, could become raw material for larvicides. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning those leaf cast-offs into mosquito-control pellets would give growers an extra revenue stream while trimming refuse piles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crop’s adaptability sweetens the deal. Hemp thrives across a wide climate range, grows quickly, and rarely needs harsh pesticides of its own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rural communities looking to diversify incomes and urban growers cultivating indoor micro-hemp could both feed a supply chain aimed at vector-control programs from Texas to Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strains-and-waterway-safety"&gt;Strains and waterway safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Field trials must still answer hard questions: How long does CBD linger in ponds? Does it bother tadpoles, fish fry, or helpful insects? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early lab work hints at selectivity, yet natural habitats are complex. Regulators will demand data showing that CBD pellets, briquettes, or slow-release films silence mosquito larvae without tipping aquatic ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second layer of testing will match different hemp strains for efficacy. Plants bred for fiber deliver more stalk than cannabinoid, while floral varieties boast &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cannabidiol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;richer CBD profiles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selecting cultivars that maximize larvicidal punch and minimize unwanted compounds will keep costs down and environmental margins wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-for-cbd-and-mosquito-control"&gt;Next steps for CBD and mosquito control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists plan to refine dosage, explore formulations that stick to the water’s surface, and probe how CBD interacts with other biocontrol measures like &lt;em&gt;Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis&lt;/em&gt;. Combining modes of action could slow resistance even further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams will also map out manufacturing pipelines – picture hemp-leaf extract concentrated at regional facilities, then shipped as shelf-stable granules to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-some-people-are-mosquito-magnets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mosquito-control districts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy makers, meanwhile, need clear guidelines. Approving a botanical larvicide means balancing urgent disease threats against conservation goals. Transparent monitoring and community engagement will help keep public trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-another-weapon-in-the-mosquito-wars"&gt;Another weapon in the mosquito wars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemp-derived CBD will not single-handedly end malaria, dengue, or Zika. Yet the discovery that a familiar wellness compound doubles as a larval assassin widens the playbook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By uniting agriculture, chemistry, and entomology, researchers have opened &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mosquito-habitats-are-expanding-due-to-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a practical path&lt;/a&gt; toward safer mosquito control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If larger-scale tests confirm the promise seen in the lab, those humble hemp leaves could soon guard countless backyard birdbaths, drainage ditches, and rice paddies – one cup of water at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/15/7/517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Insects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 21:55:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNcUVKQTh4OTlQNG1VVWFqV3pZYkFDNnp6SE1uZmhMV2dGNUJBam9uOWpBYURJOFhrN3V6di0tSks1YUJvb2tJTU5vcVV0cktjUUgzd1B2RXhHSnFwa2lrbklXNjB3Nk5wSEZvYUprcVdqZzhCOVJWUE1YMVktMVRLYkg3eUpXeEhrdUtGNFcxTkNJTjlKN0RsSzR3</guid></item><item><title>小型研究表明，仅1剂神奇蘑菇化合物可缓解大多数患者的抑郁症至少5年- Live Science | Just 1 dose of magic mushroom compound eases depression for at least 5 years in most patients, small study suggests - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxPNWtrZ0pXdjZoam5TaHNJbkFEMUw1M1hZNER3bXhHUjdReE1UR1BBLWlBYTlfTmVld2ZPRDd4Szlfem5HQWg1dVFlUTBqc1VSSmhkLWpReGZ3WDFXMVhXUVVhVXJIanRkZzkteklMejhTalV1U2tMTHVsSG5kLWprekZpMGFScWt4NkhnamJjQ2dFNVJ4dzBlUm9VQUdiNm9pS2k2Q2VMSXR5Zk15NDEw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div x-show="$store.ViafouraAuthModal.open" x-transition:enter="ease-out duration-300" x-transition:enter-start="opacity-0 translate-y-4 sm:translate-y-0 sm:scale-95" x-transition:enter-end="opacity-100 translate-y-0 sm:scale-100" x-transition:leave="ease-in duration-200" x-transition:leave-start="opacity-100 translate-y-0 sm:scale-100" x-transition:leave-end="opacity-0 translate-y-4 sm:translate-y-0 sm:scale-95" class="relative transform overflow-hidden bg-white px-4 pb-4 pt-5 text-left shadow-xl transition-all sm:my-8 w-full sm:max-w-sm sm:p-6" x-on:click.away="$store.ViafouraAuthModal.closeModal()" x-on:transitionend="$store.ViafouraAuthModal.modalFullyClosed()"&gt;

The researchers found that college students who reported high levels of pornography use showed altered patterns of brain connectivity while viewing explicit material, heightened physiological and emotional responses, and performed worse on a cognitive control task compared to those who used pornography less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was designed to investigate how repeated exposure to internet pornography might influence brain function and behavior in ways that resemble patterns observed in substance use. While many researchers have speculated that problematic pornography use shares similarities with addiction, the specific neural mechanisms have not been fully understood. This research aimed to bridge that gap using a non-invasive neuroimaging technique called functional near-infrared spectroscopy, or fNIRS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;fNIRS measures brain activity by tracking changes in blood oxygen levels. It works by shining near-infrared light into the scalp and detecting how much light is absorbed by oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the brain. These changes reflect neural activity, allowing researchers to monitor how different brain regions function during tasks or stimuli, such as watching videos or solving problems. Unlike MRI, fNIRS is portable, quiet, and allows for more natural behavior during testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixteen healthy college students who reported low-frequency pornography use and five students who met criteria for problematic pornography use were recruited to participate. All participants were right-handed, heterosexual, and free of any substance use, color blindness, or medical illness. To minimize potential confounds, participants were also instructed to abstain from masturbation during the experimental period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment involved a sequence of steps. First, participants completed the Stroop Color and Word Test—a common measure of cognitive control and reaction time. Then, they watched a 10-minute internet pornographic video selected for its high view count. During this time, researchers used fNIRS to monitor changes in brain blood flow and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physiological measures, including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, were recorded alongside facial expressions using automated software. After watching the video, participants completed the Stroop test again and filled out three psychological questionnaires measuring pornography use, anxiety, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed notable differences between the two groups. The low-frequency users showed stronger functional connectivity in brain areas related to language processing, movement coordination, and sensory processing, such as Broca’s area, the premotor cortex, and the somatosensory cortex. In contrast, the high-frequency users exhibited greater connectivity in regions tied to executive functions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar areas—regions often implicated in both addiction and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the high-frequency group also demonstrated stronger signs of physiological and emotional arousal. Their facial expressions indicated higher levels of pleasure and happiness, but also greater emotional fluctuation, including signs of anger and sadness. Their parasympathetic nervous system activity was elevated during the video, as reflected in measures like lower heart rate and increased heart rate variability. These changes are similar to patterns seen in individuals using opioid drugs, which are known to produce feelings of euphoria, calm, and blunted awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching the pornography, cognitive performance declined in both groups—but the drop was steeper in the high-frequency group. Their accuracy on the Stroop test dropped more sharply, and their reaction times were slower compared to both their own baseline and the low-frequency group. This suggests that pornography exposure may have disrupted their ability to regulate attention and manage conflicting information, at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these cognitive effects, the high-frequency group scored significantly higher on questionnaires measuring anxiety and depression. While the study cannot determine whether pornography use causes these symptoms or whether they co-occur for other reasons, the findings echo previous research linking heavy pornography consumption to emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers highlighted that certain patterns of brain activity observed in the high-frequency group resemble those seen in individuals with substance use disorders and even schizophrenia. Specifically, the increased connectivity in prefrontal areas, combined with altered physiological states and impaired cognitive performance, suggest that frequent pornography consumption may lead to neural and behavioral patterns that mimic other forms of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also explored how watching pornography affected emotional expression. The low-frequency group showed more diverse and reactive expressions—including surprise, fear, and disgust—while the high-frequency group appeared more emotionally flat, with more vacant or neutral expressions. This finding supports the idea that repeated exposure to explicit content may blunt emotional responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that while psychotherapy remains the most common treatment for problematic pornography use, other interventions have been proposed, including hormone-based medications and drugs typically used to treat obsessive-compulsive behavior. Their findings raise the possibility that treatments developed for substance addiction might also be relevant in managing internet pornography addiction, although this remains a topic of debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, there are some limitations that should be taken into account. The sample size was small, especially in the high-frequency group, which included only five individuals. This limitation may reduce the generalizability of the findings and increases the possibility of random error. Additionally, some of the observed differences in brain connectivity did not remain statistically significant after correcting for false discovery rate, a procedure used to account for the large number of comparisons made in brain imaging studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another challenge was recruitment. Due to ethical and practical constraints, it was difficult to find participants with very high levels of pornography consumption who were willing to take part in a laboratory-based experiment. As a result, even the high-frequency group in this study may represent relatively moderate users compared to populations in broader surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The effects of internet pornography addiction on brain functional connectivity in the prefrontal lobe exhibit characteristics similar to those of drug addiction,” the researchers concluded. “Moreover, individuals who frequently consume internet pornography report that they experience stronger sexual arousal and heightened pleasure while viewing, which subsequently adversely affects their cognition and emotions. Further research is needed to follow up on these preliminary findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2025.1477914" target="_blank"&gt;The impact of internet pornography addiction on brain function: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Qicheng Shu, Shiyu Tang, Zhenhua Wu, Jiahuan Feng, Wenhao Lv, and Min Huang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 18:14:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxNdDRVU1FBY3g3Q1RuYnk3UklhSVhvVm43UEpFbGIxaUdTTDc5WWhoTFM2YmJ5VERwTGYxSm1VQ0c1ZkpVdlI4MDhLMExfNEl5NXpSN1RRY1lWTHozekx4M2o1R2hRZkY2RWM5VExSbm8xOWFKc3dYV2QzRjZMNWd2bnpGNjlMWm5sRWZpbXB0VU93RXktSmtkM3FQSEM4VXVRUmYyWGthWjNqazMtWjNlck1xcmJpYjNCeTF5UkVR</guid></item><item><title>有争议的饮料，在减肥方面可能比水更好-每日邮报 | The controversial drink that may be better than water for weight loss - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxOaFJma1U3M2lTNGMtd09ncXNLQzhfdVVpRTdDTHlDS3JRZWt4WkY2Q0JvelJYT0ZSb2dFYUg4QlI5MjFjN0t3TUF1NXc0Y2pNaG1RMGxsZXpCSEluVHVfaEVkOUJiVF80V3BzMmFGY1lHYnFWUndqOFNlRWRFbkMxOG95alVEM2RjUnkyLUJUXy1mVGZid1FIaU4zOG9uUGRxRWRYZThLOTN6YTNOblNPNNIBtgFBVV95cUxPajZkQy1iMzU2U2d3QnlvV3ZGMWRkMGFSUzdaVzRFcEcxUG9WMjFRcHQ0XzZtbFpuYWVRcTIxYU9jWF9CdEh5ckNzQk9Eb21BQU1WTlBDcUZDdk1lZUEyeG5tR2lMaGVHSkhoVmtZNDNzZHE5SWhVS3dEbXdDUURnYkhTdFhiaVBIcmJYM0xHa2lzMXEtV0l2Nkw5WnhORzJqUU9EbklGbGtVTjRUdzNQRVVYRDRtZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Popular diet sodas beloved by &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/donald_trump/index.html" id="mol-5792e6d0-4b99-11f0-b20e-293d84c8345c"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/taylor_swift/index.html" id="mol-57a92df0-4b99-11f0-b20e-293d84c8345c" class=""&gt;Taylor Swift&lt;/a&gt; are better for you than water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Well, at least when it comes to losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, videos have circulated on &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-0bff59e0-4ba0-11f0-b20e-293d84c8345c"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; claiming the hidden sweetener-infused soda benefit — citing year-long studies that found participants drinking two cans of diet soda a day lost twice as much weight as those drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now nutritionists say there may be some method to the madness, by stating that that anything that can help someone reduce their calorie intake can help with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-6f432830-4ba3-11f0-ab60-0d2cbedb70ba"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This may include diet beverages, they said, which could help someone satisfy sugar cravings — reducing snacking on other calorific snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they warn the drinks likely will not lead to long-term weight loss because they do not solve sugar cravings, which can lead someone to re-gain weight after a diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marion Nestle, a top nutritionist at NYU Langone, told the Daily Mail: 'Weight gain is the result of eating more calories than are expended in metabolism and physical activity.

              &lt;p&gt;When it comes to weight loss, surgery still reigns supreme. Research out today shows that people undergoing bariatric surgery tend to lose significantly more weight than people taking the newest, most effective GLP-1 medications for obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at New York University conducted the study, which analyzed real-world data from obesity patients. People who received surgery lost five times more weight over a two year span on average than those who were prescribed a GLP-1 drug, they found. The findings also suggest that GLP-1 drugs aren’t as effective in the real world as they are in clinical trials, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think the takeaway is when you see a new popular drug come out, you have to take it with a grain of salt. And I think you have to wait a few years for the real world data to come out, because it might temper the results you’re seeing in trials,” senior study researcher Karan Chhabra, a bariatric surgeon and assistant professor of surgery and population health at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Bariatric surgery—particularly the sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass—has long been considered the most effective treatment for obesity. People usually lose between 20% and 30% of their baseline weight following surgery, and often experience &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/landmark-study-finds-life-altering-benefits-for-teens-a-decade-after-weight-loss-surgery-2000518382"&gt;long-lasting improvements&lt;/a&gt; in their general health as a result.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But in recent years, the emergence of newer GLP-1 drugs like semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) has dramatically changed the field of obesity medicine. These drugs are typically more effective (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-fen-phen-risks-1851337644"&gt;and safer&lt;/a&gt;) than past nonsurgical obesity treatments, with people on average losing between 10% and 20% of their weight in clinical trials. And they, too, have been associated with &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/people-on-ozempic-are-drinking-way-less-2000600281"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt; that extend beyond weight loss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At first glance, the data had suggested GLP-1 drugs could approach—or &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-best-obesity-drugs-arent-even-here-yet-2000547636"&gt;even surpass&lt;/a&gt;—the effectiveness of bariatric surgery. But according to Chhabra, there hasn’t yet been a rigorous head-to-head comparison of these two different types of obesity treatments among real-world patients.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Chhabra and his colleagues examined the anonymous medical records of over 50,000 people who received surgery (either a sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass) or GLP-1 therapy (either semaglutide or tirzepatide) through NYU Langone Health or NYC Health + Hospitals between 2018 and 2024. The researchers adjusted for factors like age, starting BMI, and other health conditions to make the two groups comparable. The patients and their weight loss outcomes were tracked for two years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On average, surgical patients lost 58 pounds (around 24% of their total weight) by the end of year two, whereas GLP-1 patients on average lost 12 pounds (around 4.7% of their total weight)—a fivefold difference. The results were slightly better for people who stayed on their medications for a full year (7% weight loss) and for those who took tirzepatide, the newest and most effective GLP-1 drug available (8% to 9%). But the outcomes still fell well short of the success seen with surgery—not to mention the results from earlier clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550728925001881"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; this week at the annual meeting of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are likely several reasons why these drugs aren’t as successful as they’ve appeared to be in trials, Chhabra noted. As many as 70% of GLP-1 patients discontinue use by the first year, for instance. Some will quit because the side effects, typically gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and diarrhea, are too much to bear; others may stop simply because they can’t afford the drugs any longer (GLP-1 medications often aren’t covered by insurance and can cost upwards of $1,000 a month without coverage). Many of the GLP-1 patients in their study also never reached the maximum dose.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Chhabra also suspects that many people in the real world aren’t getting the supportive care and follow-up they would get from doctors in a clinical trial. GLP-1 drugs have fueled a growing telemedicine industry—for instance, one in which people are often prescribed the medications remotely by medical professionals they’ll never interact with personally. (Until recently, people could also easily get compounded versions of semaglutide and tirzepatide, with even less assurance of safety or effectiveness.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers aren’t saying that people with obesity shouldn’t take GLP-1 drugs, nor that bariatric surgery is the ideal option for everyone. Some people might prefer a one-time treatment, for instance, or may not have the insurance or resources needed to cover long-term GLP-1 therapy. Others may be nervous about going through with any invasive procedure or have other pre-existing conditions that could complicate surgery but not GLP-1 therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, people will need to be aware of these treatments’ respective pros and cons, and those who choose to go with GLP-1s should manage their expectations, according to Chhabra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They have to know that, at least as of now in the real world, their weight loss is not going to be what we’re seeing with surgery and they also have to know that it’s a lifelong treatment,” he said. “We don’t yet have any protocols for people to maintain weight loss once they’ve stopped medications so it’s important for people to just acknowledge those realities. And I worry that a lot of people are starting medications without really knowing what they’re getting into.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team next plans to sift through more data to figure out exactly why real-life patients on GLP-1 therapy aren’t losing as much weight as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gizmodo</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 17:05:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxNQnJjNlZ5LWYtZ1JHWHdBT3p1dk9UakVFY0FXRnhkUDY4MDB0eUNnUGhLSEowelJ1aENsbUdDT2Y4RDFnUHhDSjVFQVMxemRCQU5YYWgxNVNyNmN0TUhOWWNidVR0ZlJzSkZzSGxFby05TU5Ud0MtcVJQNXBNUkNuTGhSUTBhY1ZDMF8xZnN0eEhEMFl1MGRQNi10aFR5WHlUS0M3Z2RNNlVhcUduMmFCRVZB</guid></item><item><title>比尔·盖茨：我父亲死于阿尔茨海默氏症。但我对抗击疾病比以往任何时候都更加乐观- statnews.com | Bill Gates: I lost my father to Alzheimer’s. But I’m more optimistic than ever about fighting the disease - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxONVZaQUlYb09DM0xGdWJTd1dvU0NtX1ZHWkJOSnhpXzh6a2hUckhiYmFFWDNmakxGUnBBZXBkUExlWXh4akhrdDY0UVhuNl82VTB1LWplLVVvdVpNMzZ0ODBZZnprTExBdjZWY0Fzb1EzeGdPUVhDQnFvZEFNZEp4a2J2Sll2YS1lcXNEeDUwWHBsR2YwYlNnWTBlcUlMcWZzOVQ5MElyOVJsTmU4SlE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Father’s Day without my dad never gets easier. Although he is on my mind every day, I always find myself thinking about him even more often this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My dad was a giant in every sense of the word. More than anyone else, he shaped the values of the Gates Foundation, and everything we have accomplished is a testament to his vision of a better world. Sadly, we lost my dad in 2020 to Alzheimer’s disease. Watching my brilliant, loving father go downhill and disappear was a brutal experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the years since his passing, I’ve met far too many people who had similar experiences with their own loved ones. More than &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;7 million people in the United States&lt;/a&gt; are currently living with Alzheimer’s disease. That means about 1 out of every 9 people over the age of 65 have it. As life expectancies continue to go up, those numbers will only increase.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But here’s the good news: We are making massive progress in the fight against Alzheimer’s and related dementias.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I saw some of the reasons for optimism firsthand during a visit to Indiana in 2024. I met with the team at Indiana University’s School of Medicine in Indianapolis — where they have an incredible center that is doing lots of leading-edge neuroscience — and took a super cool tour of their biomarker labs. I also got the opportunity to look under the hood of new automated machines that will soon be running diagnostics around the world. It’s an exciting time in a challenging space.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;During my visit, I learned more about the latest big breakthrough in Alzheimer’s R&amp;amp;D: blood-based diagnostic tests. A number of different companies have approaches in the pipeline, but each of them works in roughly the same way, by detecting the ratio of amyloid plaques in the brain. I’m optimistic that these tests will be a game-changer. Here in the U.S., this work reached a huge milestone in May: &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/16/alzheimers-fujirebio-fda-approval/"&gt;The FDA approved the first blood-based test for patients 55 years and older&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the only way to confirm a suspected Alzheimer’s diagnosis was to get either a &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003827.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PET scan&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557553/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;spinal tap&lt;/a&gt;. Neither is the kind of test a doctor would order unless you were showing clear signs of decline. But catching Alzheimer’s early is key. We now know that the disease begins 15 to  20 years before you start to see any signs. A simple, accurate, and easy-to-run blood test might one day make routine screening possible, identifying patients long before they experience cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I talk people about the promise of these new diagnostics, I’m often asked, “What is the point of getting diagnosed if I can’t do anything about it?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a fair question— but soon it will be moot. The FDA has approved two drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer’s. Both have proven to modestly slow down the progression of the disease, but what I’m really excited about is their potential when paired with an early diagnostic. My main takeaway from my visit to Indiana is that these treatments could be drastically more impactful than I initially thought when given early in the disease’s progression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://trials.lilly.com/en-US/trial/302480" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Phase 3 clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are underway now to prove just how transformative these drugs are for people with presymptomatic Alzheimer’s, and we could see results as soon as 2026. Until then, the drugs will continue to help patients who are already showing cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m also optimistic that researchers will continue to improve current treatments and develop new drugs. This will require running lots of clinical trials. Without a simple diagnostic test, it is often difficult to find enough eligible patients. In some cases, it takes even take longer to enroll participants — as long as three years! — than to conduct the study. My hope is that the new blood tests will get the recruitment time down to less than a year and accelerate the development of new drugs.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;All of this progress hinges, of course, on continued funding for Alzheimer’s research. Some of the biggest breakthroughs to date were supported by federal grants, like the discovery of the connection between amyloid proteins and the disease. This isn’t unusual: Medical R&amp;amp;D often relies on government funding to support projects that explore foundational science or aren’t commercially viable yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are on the cusp of turning the tide against dementia — which makes this an especially bad time to pull back on research. Recent cuts to the National Institutes of Health and other government institutions threaten to stop progress in its tracks, and no individual or private organization can fill the gap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the moment to spend &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; money on research, not less. Right now, all over the world, researchers are collecting data about Alzheimer’s disease. New tools are making it easier for them to share information and work together. As a result, the quest to stop Alzheimer’s has never had more momentum. For my part, I worked with a coalition of partners to create the &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersdata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s Disease Data Initiative&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://grip-research.org/platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Global Research and Imaging Platform&lt;/a&gt;, and I am proud to support organizations like the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation’s Diagnostics Accelerator and &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/partthecloud/overview.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Part the Cloud&lt;/a&gt;. All of these efforts simplify how researchers and data scientists work together to share data and develop algorithms and tools in order to make advances in the field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is still a huge amount of work to be done — like deepening our understanding of the disease’s pathology and developing even better diagnostics. But I am blown away by how much we have learned about Alzheimer’s over the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we lost my dad, an Alzheimer’s diagnosis was a death sentence. Just five years later, that is finally starting to change. I cannot help but be filled with a sense of hope when I think of all the progress being made on Alzheimer’s, even with so many challenges happening around the world. We are closer than ever before to a world where no one has to watch someone they love suffer from this awful disease.&lt;/p&gt;

Medical professionals across multiple disciplines also advocate for a balanced and nutritious &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food/a64540833/is-carnivore-diet-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; to maintain your overall health. But sometimes even your favorite foods can do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The food we eat is packed with different nutrients that impact our bodies in their own ways. When you take medication and eat certain foods, they can interact negatively and affect the efficacy of your medication or induce unpleasant side effects. And some of the most common culprits are ingredients you may already have in your kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We consulted &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewfranklynmiller/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr Andy Franklyn-Miller,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr Andy Franklyn-Miller,&lt;/a&gt; MBBS, PhD, MRCGP FFSEM, a dual board-certified Sports and Exercise Medicine Physician and Chief Medical and Innovation Officer at &lt;a href="https://www.nuritas.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nuritas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nuritas&lt;/a&gt;, to break down some of the most common foods that can interact with medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first, a disclaimer: this is by no means an exhaustive list of ingredients or a substitute for medical advice from your own healthcare team. When you start taking a new medication, we suggest you consult your doctor or pharmacist about what foods to look out for and how to adjust your diet accordingly. Depending on the medication and your own individual care plan, those adjustments can range from avoiding a food entirely to reducing your intake to carefully timing the consumption of your food with your doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Grapefruit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;R.Tsubin - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you take prescription medication, you may need to put down your &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a43758194/paloma-cocktail-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:paloma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;paloma&lt;/a&gt;. Grapefruit, as well as its juice, is a common ingredient that interacts with a wide range of prescriptions. “Grapefruit inhibits the enzyme CYP3A4 in the liver and intestines, which metabolizes many drugs,” Franklyn-Miller says. “This can lead to higher drug concentrations in the bloodstream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without this enzyme, your medications will accumulate and linger in your bloodstream, which can increase your risk of side effects. Grapefruit causes interactions across several drug categories, including statins, calcium channel blockers, and immunosuppressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dairy Products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Jose A. Bernat Bacete - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calcium has long been heralded as an essential mineral, but it may have less than ideal effects if you take certain antibiotics. “Calcium-rich foods like milk, cheese, and yogurt can bind to antibiotics such as tetracycline and fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin, forming insoluble complexes that reduce drug absorption in the gut,” Franklyn-Miller says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for any foods supplemented with calcium, like certain varieties of orange juice and &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/a65059238/is-almond-milk-or-oat-milk-healthier/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:many almond milks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;many almond milks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Leafy Greens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Crispin la valiente - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A general rule of thumb is that darker greens have more nutrient density. One of the most common nutrients is vitamin K, which plays an essential role in blood clotting and bone health. But if you take certain anticoagulant blood pressure medications, vitamin K is more harmful than helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Foods like spinach, kale, and broccoli, high in vitamin K, can counteract the effects of anticoagulants like warfarin, which relies on inhibiting vitamin K-dependent clotting factors to prevent blood clots,” says Franklyn-Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Oscar Wong - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals warn about the adverse health effects of consuming large quantities of alcohol, which is classified as a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/a64342317/is-drinking-wine-every-day-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:carcinogen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;. But beyond increasing your risk of cancer and organ damage in the long term, alcohol also can have a significant impact on your prescription medications in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alcohol can amplify or diminish the effects of medications,” Franklyn-Miller says. “For instance, it enhances the sedative effects of benzodiazepines like diazepam and increases the risk of liver toxicity when combined with acetaminophen.” Alcohol also greatly increases the sedative effects of melatonin, which is why Franklyn-Miller suggests the use of other natural peptides as alternative sleep aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aged, Cured, &amp;amp; Fermented Foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;LauriPatterson - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the oldest and most prevalent food preservation techniques, like aging, curing, and fermenting, lead to the development of the amino acid tyramine. Tyramine can be found in large quantities in foods like cheese, soy sauce, sauerkraut, sausages, and different types of alcohol. It’s a natural byproduct of these preservation processes, but tyramine also interacts with particular medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Franklyn-Miller says tyramine-rich foods “can cause dangerous blood pressure spikes in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), used for depression or Parkinson’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again: this list isn't comprehensive, nor is it meant to replace guidance from your doctor or medical team. If you have any questions or concerns about how your medications may interact with certain foods, always consult your healthcare provider before making any changes to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 17:02:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5KUjdubVlMR3FUNW1Ld3h2RUFqUHJWTFBpU29vUnZ4Q0RzQmp3X0FKUldBeGxOSlZydG9yREhHbkNKWi1XNlBLNGJHRWw5T3ZXcEhMQUNTZ1hPa1c1U19hS0VlTG9FdWdLUVZwM3hHcXE</guid></item><item><title>什么是代谢综合征–我们真的需要担心吗？ -卫报 | What is metabolic syndrome – and do we really need to worry about it? - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQR09CZ190emJTZk5NcHo2Ql84WGk3aE5kWDg1OHBpX3dOdVdNbVVZVEVSUTltOEZ0ajZVYk1rU0NFTjd5Nzc1YVNWMHVLRVhWRFVEOU5MTTJnUnB5czQyLXNBME9wNWR3enhMdm9ScERuenIzeU1Ia1g5amctNlViNw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;etabolic syndrome is trending online.

Some content creators do relay accurate information about it, but messaging can take a turn toward scienceploitation, or the use of scientific language to sell untested products and diet plans, says &lt;a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/law/faculty-and-research/health-law-institute/people/timothycaulfield.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Tim Caulfield&lt;/a&gt;, a professor and research director of the Health Law Institute at the University of Alberta. (Casey Means has received &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/surgeon-general-trump-casey-means-affiliate-conflicts-8d8cb29defa07028dbd97fc24a72c474" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt; for using her platform to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/casey-means-md_mitochondrial-health-is-the-key-to-our-overall-activity-7194141372306657280-IeHU/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;amp;rcm=ACoAAAaT3xQBYkrYDa5-wdEAwstp5vqfrN7Xgi0" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;advertise products&lt;/a&gt; like mitochondrial health supplements.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Taking action to avoid metabolic syndrome could benefit many, but misinformation can lead to unwanted grief, distrust and dollars spent. Here’s what doctors and scientists say about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Metabolic syndrome refers to having multiple conditions that increase the risk of health problems like diabetes, stroke and heart disease. These conditions include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, abdominal obesity, high blood triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol, also known as the “good cholesterol.” According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, having &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/metabolic-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;three or more&lt;/a&gt; of those conditions means you may have metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“When you combine these conditions, you develop metabolic syndrome,” explains Dr Blanca Lizaola-Mayo, a quadruple board-certified physician, the Medical Director of the Transplant Hepatology Center and the co-founder of the Metabolic Liver Clinic at Mayo Clinic in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Many people with metabolic syndrome also have &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/metabolic-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it harder for cells to absorb glucose, raising blood sugar levels and increasing the risk of related health problems. Insulin is one of several hormones that help regulate metabolism. Factors like poor diet and chronic stress can dysregulate these hormones, contributing to metabolic syndrome, explains Lizaola-Mayo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Sometimes, content creators use the phrase “metabolic dysfunction” instead. These terms are being used online to describe a similar phenomenon, says Lizaola-Mayo. But “metabolic syndrome” refers to specific medical conditions, as described above. Meanwhile, there is no &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35785479/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unified definition of “metabolic dysfunction”&lt;/a&gt;, but it refers more generally to the metabolism not functioning well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/metabolic-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one in three&lt;/a&gt; American adults has metabolic syndrome. In the UK, the estimate is &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/genetic-conditions/metabolic-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one in four&lt;/a&gt; adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the risk of metabolic syndrome &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/metabolic-syndrome/causes" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increases&lt;/a&gt; with age, incidence is &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pmj/article/99/1175/985/7076129" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rising&lt;/a&gt; overall. This prevalence may be partly explained by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8595506/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/14/should-i-worry-about-how-long-i-spend-sitting-down" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;sedentary behavior&lt;/a&gt; among adults, along with the proliferation of highly processed foods and food additives that can &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;trigger&lt;/a&gt; inflammation, says Lizaola-Mayo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-mitochondria" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What are mitochondria?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Mitochondria are cell parts that convert nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy for cellular processes. To have good health, we need our mitochondria to produce energy efficiently and communicate well, says &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/martin-picard-phd" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Martin Picard&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor and doctor of the Mitochondrial Psychobiology Group at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;People with metabolic syndrome may have some signs of reduced mitochondrial function, says &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/iphy/people/research-professors/matthew-j-rossman" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Matt Rossman&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant research professor in integrative physiology at the University of Colorado, Boulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-mitochondrial-dysfunction" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is mitochondrial dysfunction?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In this context, the term “dysfunction” does not mean that mitochondria are broken or damaged, though &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dhru.purohit/video/7368516938818948394?q=mitochondrial%20dysfunciton&amp;amp;t=1748627444850" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;that phrasing is sometimes misused&lt;/a&gt; online and in wellness spaces. “You can have metabolic syndrome without having defective mitochondria,” Picard says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The term “mitochondrial dysfunction” doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong with the mitochondria, but suggests they aren’t working as efficiently as they should, says Jerry Chipuk, a professor of oncological sciences and dermatology, as well as the founder and director of the Mitochondrial Analysis Facility, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Sanna Darvish, a PhD student candidate at CU Boulder, says “mitochondrial dysfunction” can be a vague term, but in her and Rossman’s research, it’s related to a process that results in oxidative stress. This is linked to ageing and health issues, like metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although a person with metabolic syndrome may have less efficient mitochondria, this is distinct from a mitochondrial disease, which is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3786640/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a very rare condition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The signs of metabolic syndrome are the underlying conditions mentioned above, like high blood sugar and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But it can also be a “silent disease”, explains Lizaola-Mayo. For example, metabolic syndrome increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, and many diagnosed individuals “have been diabetic for years without realizing it”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some subtle changes may indicate a decline in metabolic health, she says, including frequent headaches, blurry vision, excessive thirst and increased urination. Unusual tiredness and weakness can also indicate an issue. Medical providers use blood pressure and blood tests to &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/metabolic-syndrome/symptoms" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;diagnose&lt;/a&gt; metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Genetic and environmental factors influence the development of metabolic syndrome. The latter is what we can control, says Lizaola-Mayo, but it can be challenging to eat well and exercise consistently. Time and costs are significant obstacles, and marketing can &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022242920944384" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;trick consumers&lt;/a&gt; into thinking some food products are healthier than they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-25" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The best meal plans and exercise routines are the ones you enjoy, she says, because those are the ones you’ll stick with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The reality is that we don’t need to diet,” she says. “We need to change our nutrition for good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;GLP-1 medications can &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/may/17/weight-loss-drugs-altering-views-how-body-brain-work" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;help patients&lt;/a&gt; whose metabolic syndrome has progressed to type 2 diabetes. Still, these medications need to be used in conjunction with lifestyle modifications to achieve long-term benefits, says Lizaola-Mayo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Preventive care, including blood work and &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/routine-screenings" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;routine screenings&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the best ways to avoid future illnesses. If you’re concerned about metabolic syndrome, seek a regular checkup with your primary care physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-keep-mitochondria-healthy" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How do you keep mitochondria healthy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Mitochondria rely on various nutrients to make ATP, Chipuk explains, so a balanced diet is ideal, he says. But a very carbohydrate-heavy or high-sugar diet can erode mitochondrial function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exercise has a “profound effect” on mitochondria, says Rossman, increasing the number of mitochondria and supporting their ability to consume oxygen and produce ATP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/obesity-disrupts-mitochondria-reduces-fat-burning" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;animal studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest obesity can make mitochondria less effective, Chipuk cautions that not all forms of weight loss are healthy. He emphasizes it’s “more about strengthening the body than simply eliminating extra pounds”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Activities like chronic smoking and drinking alcohol can contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231714001104" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mitochondrial dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;. Stress also impedes mitochondria, Chipuk says. Meanwhile, positive life experiences seem to be associated with &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1321881111" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;healthier mitochondria&lt;/a&gt;, says Picard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-supplements" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What about supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11393155/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; on mitochondrial health supplements is ongoing. But in most cases, there’s not enough valid medical information to support the use of supplements for metabolic syndrome, says Lizaola-Mayo. More large randomized controlled trials are needed to determine if they can provide clinically meaningful benefits, says Rossman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s essential to be very careful with supplements,” says Lizaola-Mayo. “You can achieve more with exercise and a simple, healthy diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Picard also finds supplements “overrated” and doesn’t see them as the way forward for mitochondrial health, instead emphasizing the medical benefits of exercise and nutrition. Lizaola-Mayo cautions that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5502701/#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown some supplements contain additives that &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821951" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;damage the liver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Navigating health decisions is challenging, even when you’re feeling well, says Caufield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The conventional healthcare system does not treat people well, especially women and people of color,” he says. “On top of that, resource constraints can make it even more complicated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So it’s understandable that people turn to the internet for guidance. But beware “grifters exploiting genuine problems with the health care system and using scientific language to sell their products”, says Caufield. Red flags include offering overly simple solutions to complex issues, or relying on a single study, he says: “If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 16:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQR09CZ190emJTZk5NcHo2Ql84WGk3aE5kWDg1OHBpX3dOdVdNbVVZVEVSUTltOEZ0ajZVYk1rU0NFTjd5Nzc1YVNWMHVLRVhWRFVEOU5MTTJnUnB5czQyLXNBME9wNWR3enhMdm9ScERuenIzeU1Ia1g5amctNlViNw</guid></item><item><title>旅行急救箱中的物品：要包括的关键项目-《纽约时报》 | What to Put in a Travel First-Aid Kit: Key Items to Include - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE95Sy1WVk9zaXNKeS11MWp3bVdMeTNiT2RZQnlXV2I0dEkxREsza0x5NlRKYTlBS0dVVjNRcFA4YkFKQU5xZi0xc01IT0dGT3RyOTl6dlltUTRYNVQtdmRLVEJQcURCTGc3VnVrQXR1RTdpQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 15:39:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE95Sy1WVk9zaXNKeS11MWp3bVdMeTNiT2RZQnlXV2I0dEkxREsza0x5NlRKYTlBS0dVVjNRcFA4YkFKQU5xZi0xc01IT0dGT3RyOTl6dlltUTRYNVQtdmRLVEJQcURCTGc3VnVrQXR1RTdpQQ</guid></item><item><title>MS发病年龄与长期身心健康相关：研究-今日多发性硬化症新闻 | Age at MS onset linked to long-term physical, mental health: Study - Multiple Sclerosis News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxPeWhmR080bUxyTHRTamtaTVNUVEJJU0xsTDl5TFZvbmtseFhqTU9uRkV4TlAwZHFmMG4tQm56RnVtNERtR3owUE45LXlndWR4Vnc0UHNQVzlIekxGRDlNTUJnRy1iYWcwTFdJei1yRUlfOWRoOERWQkctS3ZER3JYLUYzNWRsajk5dmt0bnF4a0FBN1N2MFF3eXpVQU5qSHBNNHlneE1CZ3JuOERCbXF4OTdpMHUwX2xiVVhQNQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who develop &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS) at a younger age tend to consistently have better physical health but worse mental health than those diagnosed later, a study found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While physical health declined in the long term for all age groups, and mental health increased, the differences between groups were sustained over time, which the researchers said highlighted the need for age-tailored care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to determine what kind of mental health support may maximize quality of life in people with younger age of onset, and which specific aspects of physical health may be targeted to improve quality of life in those with older onset disease, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211034825003037"&gt;Age of multiple sclerosis symptom onset affects mental and physical health-related quality of life in opposite directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective covering of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, causing damage. This results in &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as blurred vision, fatigue, and difficulty walking — all of which pose limitations in daily life and take a toll on mental health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;MS onset and disability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While MS usually begins in adulthood, it can develop before age 18, in which case it is called &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/4-types-ms/#Rare_Forms"&gt;pediatric-onset MS&lt;/a&gt; (POMS). Some studies have suggested that people with pediatric-onset disease may develop physical disability when they are several years younger than those who develop the disease in adulthood, but evidence to date has been mixed. It’s also not clear how the age at MS onset affects mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, a team of researchers in Canada examined data from 699 patients who were followed over time as part of the Canadian Prospective Cohort Study to Understand Progression in Multiple Sclerosis (&lt;a href="https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12883-021-02447-7"&gt;CanProCo&lt;/a&gt;), which is &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2022/04/11/1m-invested-canadian-study-effects-childhood-onset-ms-over-time/"&gt;funded&lt;/a&gt; in part by &lt;a href="https://www.biogen.ca/"&gt;Biogen Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.rochecanada.com/"&gt;Roche Canada&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://braincanada.ca/"&gt;Brain Canada Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at how the age at which someone first experiences &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS symptoms&lt;/a&gt; affects their health-related quality of life — both physically and mentally — as they live with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of participants had &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing-remitting MS&lt;/a&gt; (93%), and the rest had &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/primary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-ppms/"&gt;primary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt;. The average age at symptom onset was 33.2, with 16.9% having symptoms before age 25 and 2.3% having POMS. At the time of the analysis, they had been living with the disease for a mean of 4.8 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed that patients who developed MS at a younger age tended to report better physical health than those with a later onset. Physical health was measured using the MS Quality of Life-54 (MSQoL-54), where higher scores mean better health. For every five-year increase in age of onset, scores decreased by 1.5 points, which is considered the minimal clinically important clinical difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mental health-related quality of life, which was also measured using the MSQoL-54, showed the opposite pattern. Patients who developed MS at a younger age reported worse mental health than those who developed it when they were older, with scores increasing 2.5 points — the minimal clinically important clinical difference for this score — for every 12-year increase in age of onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, physical health scores dropped and mental health scores rose in all patients. This challenges the common practice of dividing study patients into two groups — pediatric and adult onset — and suggests researchers might look more closely at how different ages within those groups may lead to different outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Patterns in physical and mental health perceptions seen in pediatric onset MS are also seen in people with young adult-onset MS, challenging the role for studying age of onset dichotomously as done previously,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length of time someone has had MS, known as disease duration, did not fully explain the differences in physical and mental health between age groups. Instead, disability levels, measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, did account for 63.7% of the differences in physical health and 61.3% of the differences in mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that other factors — possibly related to self-management abilities, disease-modifying therapy use, and social participation — may influence how people with MS experience their physical and mental health, the researchers said. These factors could potentially be changed or improved, offering a strategy to achieve better long-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Future studies evaluating HrQoL [health-related quality of life] over longer periods will be important to provide evidence-based mental health support to maximize HrQoL for people with young onset MS,” the team wrote. “In contrast, ongoing studies evaluating specific aspects of physical health in older onset MS … will be important to maximize the longevity of physical functioning in people with MS.”&lt;/p&gt;

In that time I have had a front seat to a dramatic version of the adverse effect that oncologists often mention in passing to breast cancer patients using anti-oestrogen therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“How often do you experience this?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A dozen times on a good day,” she shrugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Roughly three-quarters of breast cancers are oestrogen-receptor positive, which means the cancer cells are stimulated by oestrogen. Women with this type of cancer benefit from oestrogen suppression, achieved via different methods including a pill, an injection and removal of the ovaries. This induces menopause in younger women and more complete oestrogen suppression in the already menopausal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;With more than 20,000 Australian women and 2 million women worldwide diagnosed with breast cancer every year, anti-oestrogen medication is akin to the penicillin of oncology. Each week, I write, renew and replace multiple scripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But while every prescriber mentions the anticipated side-effect of hot flushes, it strikes me that no one (including me) quite explains the living horror that many patients go on to experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Women who have concluded an arduous trek of chemotherapy and radiation for early breast cancer express the hope of “never having to go through this again”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Women with metastatic breast cancer harbour the hope that their cancer, while not curable, may remain at bay for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Every woman’s risk profile warrants a tailored conversation but, broadly speaking, imagine giving this advice: “There is an effective medication to reduce recurrence risk and improve survival. Over the many years you will be on it, you &lt;a href="https://www.bcna.org.au/resources/side-effects/side-effects-by-diagnosis-or-treatment/side-effects-of-hormone-blocking-therapy/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;could experience&lt;/a&gt; hot flushes, stiff joints, disturbed sleep, low mood, weight gain and sexual dysfunction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If it sounds like punishment served at the end of a punishing diagnosis, it is. However, when a drug works, oncologists want to encourage adherence and hope that the side-effects either don’t occur or can be managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Vasomotor symptoms”, the medical term for hot flushes, affect up to 90% of women with breast cancer and are often severe. Up to half of all women prescribed anti-oestrogen medication stop taking the drug – and they are just the ones who tell us. Every oncologist knows the heart-sink moment when a high-risk patient declines treatment. But we also know all too well the toll that led them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Given the ubiquitous nature of hot flushes, the lack of good treatments is frustrating. Of the panoply of advertised options such as cognitive behavioural therapy, acupuncture, hypnosis, diet, exercise and off-label use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants, none has been shown to help in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Then there is the irony of taking one medication to counter the side-effect of another and gaining weight and its associated complications in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As a result, most women just put up with the trailing cost of having breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now, there is hope. In a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2415566" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;randomised controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; of drug versus placebo, a once-daily pill meaningfully reduced hot flushes in women taking anti-oestrogen therapy for breast cancer. &lt;a href="https://www.bayer.com/en/us/news-stories/elinzanetant" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Elinzanetant&lt;/a&gt; works by affecting the brain signals involved in temperature regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At baseline, women experienced a mean of a dozen daily episodes. By one month, 61% of women on active treatment reported a reduction of at least 50% in the daily frequency of moderate-to-severe hot flushes compared with 27% on placebo. Sleep quality improved, as did overall quality of life. Crossover from placebo to the active drug resulted in similar findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;No drug is without side-effects. More than 60% of women in each group reported at least one mild adverse event but severe ones were rare. Somnolence, fatigue and diarrhoea were reported more frequently in the active therapy group but they can also be caused by cancer therapy. More than 90% of women who completed one year of treatment chose to continue for an optional two years, suggesting a high rate of acceptability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c316db28-eaaa-411e-82a3-4c2b678a9d7a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":23,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"The experts: oncologists on the simple, doable, everyday things they do to try to prevent cancer","elementId":"c316db28-eaaa-411e-82a3-4c2b678a9d7a","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/11/the-experts-oncologists-on-the-simple-doable-everyday-things-they-do-to-try-to-prevent-cancer"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":8,"display":0,"theme":1}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The drug is yet unapproved and oncologists will seek more details before widespread prescribing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Breast cancer outcomes are poorer in non-white women but 88% of the participants were white.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology report walking more than 100 minutes per day was associated with a 23% lower risk of chronic low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Low back pain affects people of all ages and accounts for 7.7% of all years lived with disability worldwide, ranking among the most costly chronic conditions in health care. In the US, back pain generates some of the highest health care spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking is the most affordable and accessible form of exercise for many. While &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/guidelines/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommend maintaining &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; for the management of chronic low back pain, they offer no explicit targets for walking frequency or duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Volume and Intensity of Walking and Risk of Chronic Low Back Pain," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2835297" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/prospective+cohort+study/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;prospective cohort study&lt;/a&gt; to examine whether accelerometer-derived daily walking volume and walking intensity are associated with the risk of chronic LBP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants included 11,194 adults aged 20 years or older without chronic low back pain at baseline, drawn from the Trøndelag Health Study between 2017 and 2019, with follow-up from 2021 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two tri-axial AX3 accelerometers worn for a week measured daily walking volume and walking intensity. Self-reported &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+low+back+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic low back pain&lt;/a&gt; at follow-up, defined as pain lasting three months or longer in the past 12 months, served as the primary outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those walking 101–124 minutes per day showed a risk ratio of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68–0.87), and those walking 125 minutes or more showed a risk ratio of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.67–0.87). Higher walking intensity was also associated with reduced risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest public health strategies promoting walking volume may confer more pronounced preventive benefits than walking intensity for reducing the burden of chronic &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/low+back+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;low back pain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

To provide an apt example, an Instagram video shows how a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; named Baker attracts all kinds of animals. In the caption, the adorable and gentle pooch is referred to as “A real life Disney Prince.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Instagram video shows Golden Retriever’s interaction with various animals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent video on Instagram features a compilation of clips of a Golden Retriever’s interaction with various animals. Describing the pet’s personality, his owner mentions a line on it, saying, “My golden has the gentlest soul and attracts all kinds of animals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video begins with the &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/180020-dog-lounging-pool-pregnant-mom-viral-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dog;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; named Baker showcasing a curious face while looking at a bird. The two creatures observe each other in close proximity. In the next scene, someone holds a dragonfly while the pooch tries to jump a little and smell it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/bakerbarnes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Baker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Baker&lt;/a&gt; interacts with a Koi fish as he leans towards a pond, and one fish jumps up and tries to hold the canine’s nose. He pulls his head back first, but becomes curious again. In the final clip, the pet approaches a flying bug and reacts similarly. Throughout his interactions with different creatures, none of the animals reject Baker’s advances. It proves the dog’s gentle behavior towards others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the video has gained viewers’ attention. They called Baker a “gentle spirit,” “sweetie,” and “gentle soul.” A user commented, “How can you be so sweet,” while another wrote, “What a beautiful little soul your dog has.” Some referred to him as “Disney princess” and “adorable prince.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a few of them liked the Golden Retriever’s interaction with the fish the most. One said, “Oh I love his floppy ears watching the koi fish.” A viewer also mentioned, “i love that the koi fish also wanted to boop him.” Since the upload, the Instagram video has received over 25K likes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/180029-dog-golden-retriever-animal-instagram-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gentle Dog Attracts All Kinds of Animals in Compilation Video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gentle Dog Attracts All Kinds of Animals in Compilation Video&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 15:12:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9oa0kyWGxtNFVRUnduaVp5MURhWlZHUnNwMTZxWTNLbHZrZjlSaGlWQ1BOcU5PLWk1VnBSVllaakppeS1KSFBsUDFLbkVhblJySVlZX1d6aVlTczJ6NVdlY3I2Z1VrNDNFeUdWcWxxNngyNEVZQk9J</guid></item><item><title>如果您已经接受了这6种日常生活，那么您就是优雅衰老的大师- VegOut | If you’ve embraced these 6 daily routines, you are a master of graceful aging - VegOut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxNMXUyTzhlZ1o3TTlSR1pqSkI0elg1SjhDY3JHaHQ2QUgtVTRlZlZLZ3lXTFJpaHFwazZYRzFGb2dzRUk2bHZmNGVFWFVwblN3WVBQVm9NdXIwVGdiMndYZmFFRGRpaWszV25jVGhQMTU5M0VRYU1jM1I0RTlfSVBEMWk5Mzc1Y2VCWWUyZHhsNzdrODZvQnR5MEM0MnlSd3ZHYTNMOFNSZXRXQkIxNTdPTVhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="118" data-end="515"&gt;We were halfway through brunch when my friend Cora—who just turned 60—whipped a resistance band from her purse “in case a park workout breaks out later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="118" data-end="515"&gt;Everyone laughed, but no one was surprised. Cora has become the unofficial yard‑stick for aging well in our circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="118" data-end="515"&gt;She carries herself with the calm of someone who’s done the emotional math and decided each day is worth compound interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="517" data-end="849"&gt;That got me thinking: What line items belong on the “aging gracefully” balance sheet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="517" data-end="849"&gt;After a decade of turning financial dashboards into habit trackers, I’ve landed on six daily routines that raise your vitality bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="517" data-end="849"&gt;Each one is actionable, budget‑friendly, and—if you already practice them—proof you’re ahead of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="856" data-end="892"&gt;1. Moving like it’s non‑negotiable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="894" data-end="1296"&gt;Picture a zero‑based budget: every dollar gets assigned before the month begins.&lt;br data-start="974" data-end="977"&gt;Graceful agers treat movement the same way—no leftovers, no “maybe tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="894" data-end="1296"&gt;My own spreadsheet shows three non‑consecutive 10‑minute blocks: a brisk walk between morning meetings, a set of body‑weight squats before lunch, and a dance‑along video after work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="894" data-end="1296"&gt;That’s it. Thirty minutes, yet the ROI keeps compounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1298" data-end="1675"&gt;Harvard epidemiologist &lt;strong data-start="1321" data-end="1338"&gt;Dr. I‑Min Lee&lt;/strong&gt; calls exercise “the closest thing we have to a magic pill” for longevity &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2023/harvard-scientists-exercise-science-and-health?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;harvardmagazine.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1298" data-end="1675"&gt;The benefits read like an all‑in‑one ETF: lower blood pressure, better insulin sensitivity, brighter mood. And because micro‑workouts sidestep the “I need an hour” objection, they’re the easiest way to lock in gains daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1677" data-end="1877"&gt;If you’re already penciling movement into your calendar—walking calls, stair breaks, yoga stretches while the kettle boils—you’re signaling to your future self that mobility is non‑negotiable capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1884" data-end="1924"&gt;2. Prioritizing sleep like your 401(k)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1926" data-end="2207"&gt;You wouldn’t skip automatic contributions to a retirement plan; why skip the nightly deposits of deep sleep?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1926" data-end="2207"&gt;Neuroscientist &lt;strong data-start="2050" data-end="2068"&gt;Matthew Walker&lt;/strong&gt; calls sleep “the Swiss Army knife of health” &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://www.npr.org/2017/11/13/563831137/the-swiss-army-knife-of-health-a-good-nights-sleep?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;npr.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, repairing everything from memory to immune function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2209" data-end="2460"&gt;A trick I borrowed from budgeting: “pay yourself first.” At 9 p.m., phone goes on airplane mode, lights dim, lo‑fi playlist cues the wind‑down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2209" data-end="2460"&gt;This simple rule shaved 20 minutes off my sleep‑onset time—worth roughly two extra hours of REM per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2462" data-end="2728"&gt;Already guarding an eight‑hour window? That’s mastery in action. Quality sleep stabilizes appetite hormones, sharpens emotional regulation, and even improves skin barrier repair—dividends makeup can’t fake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2462" data-end="2728"&gt;Keep treating bedtime like it belongs on the balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2735" data-end="2774"&gt;3. Feeding your gut’s retirement fund&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2776" data-end="3075"&gt;Fiber and fermented foods are the dividend stocks of nutrition: boring until you notice they keep paying out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2776" data-end="3075"&gt;I batch‑prep overnight oats with chia and stir a spoonful of homemade kimchi (my old fermenting hobby) into salads. The goal is 25–30 grams of fiber and at least one probiotic food daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3077" data-end="3343"&gt;Why? A diverse gut microbiome produces short‑chain fatty acids that lower inflammation—an under‑the‑radar driver of age‑related decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3077" data-end="3343"&gt;People who age gracefully often talk about “feeling light” after meals; their microbiota balance is doing unsung heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3345" data-end="3533"&gt;If you’re already sipping kombucha, sprinkling flaxseed, or swapping white rice for quinoa, you’re future‑proofing your metabolism and mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3345" data-end="3533"&gt;Consider it interest that never stops accruing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3540" data-end="3573"&gt;4. Keeping curiosity on autopay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3575" data-end="3812"&gt;Remember Cora’s resistance band? She also just took a pottery class and is learning basic Korean, because K‑dramas “hit different when you get the jokes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3575" data-end="3812"&gt;Novel skill‑building isn’t a midlife vanity project; it’s neural cross‑training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3814" data-end="4132"&gt;A Johns Hopkins–led study found that older adults who learned multiple real‑world skills simultaneously showed cognitive gains comparable to people 30 years younger &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10394988/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3814" data-end="4132"&gt;Think of each new hobby—gardening, coding, ukulele—as a diversified asset that hedges against mental stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4134" data-end="4395"&gt;Already blocking 20 minutes for Duolingo, Udemy, or a DIY home‑repair video? You’re feeding the brain’s growth budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4134" data-end="4395"&gt;Keep stacking micro‑lessons; the returns arrive as sharper recall, creative problem‑solving, and a sense of agency no wrinkle cream can match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4402" data-end="4443"&gt;5. Banking micro‑moments of mindfulness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4445" data-end="4658"&gt;When anxiety spikes, I open a blank Google Sheet, breathe three times, and do nothing else for 60 seconds—it’s my mental “reconciliation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4445" data-end="4658"&gt;The point isn’t productivity; it’s noticing tension before it compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4660" data-end="4961"&gt;Mindfulness practices—from two‑minute box breaths to a phone‑free walk—reduce cortisol and strengthen the prefrontal cortex, the decision‑maker that keeps reactions aligned with long‑term goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4660" data-end="4961"&gt;The beauty? You can sprinkle these pauses between any tasks without blocking extra calendar real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4963" data-end="5194"&gt;If you’re already pausing to sense your shoulders unclench or naming the flavor of your coffee before chugging it, you’re not just calm—you’re structurally upgrading neural circuitry that decides how gracefully you navigate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5201" data-end="5238"&gt;6. Cultivating social micro‑touches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5240" data-end="5543"&gt;Longevity researchers keep circling back to one metric: meaningful connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5240" data-end="5543"&gt;Yet the graceful agers I survey don’t necessarily have huge networks; they have consistent micro‑touches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5240" data-end="5543"&gt;A 90‑second voice note to a cousin, a two‑line text to an old colleague, a hallway compliment that says “I see you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5545" data-end="5846"&gt;Think of each interaction as a small deposit into a shared emotional account. Over months, it yields trust, perspective, even accountability—critical when setbacks hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5545" data-end="5846"&gt;Social micro‑touches also act like real‑time market indicators; they reveal when your energy is dipping or resentment creeping in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5848" data-end="6020"&gt;If you’re already nudging relationships forward with tiny, authentic gestures, you’re reinforcing a safety net that cushions aging’s inevitable curveballs. That’s graceful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6027" data-end="6043"&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6045" data-end="6161"&gt;Aging well isn’t a grand slam; it’s dollar‑cost averaging—steady inputs that harness time instead of wrestling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6163" data-end="6172"&gt;If you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="6173" data-end="6432"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6173" data-end="6219"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6175" data-end="6219"&gt;schedule movement like a standing expense,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6220" data-end="6266"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6222" data-end="6266"&gt;clock eight solid hours as non‑negotiable,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6267" data-end="6296"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6269" data-end="6296"&gt;fiber‑feed the gut daily,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6297" data-end="6349"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6299" data-end="6349"&gt;learn something delightfully useless on purpose,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6350" data-end="6392"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6352" data-end="6392"&gt;pause for 60‑second mental audits, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6393" data-end="6432"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6395" data-end="6432"&gt;ping the people who make you laugh—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6434" data-end="6504"&gt;then you already hold a diversified portfolio for the decades ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6506" data-end="6625"&gt;Keep auditing, tweaking, and celebrating the small wins. Grace isn’t luck; it’s the quiet math of consistent choices.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking coffee appears to be linked with healthier aging by potentially lowering the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A recent study followed over 47,000 women for several decades, and it found that those who consumed the highest amounts of caffeine, primarily from coffee, have 13% greater odds of healthy aging,” said&lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/providers/christieyoussef" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Christie Youssef&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine physician with Kaiser Permanente in Fairfax, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Healthy aging in this study was defined as reaching the age of 70 or older without major chronic diseases or cognitive impairment,” said Youssef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Youssef said the study adds to a growing body evidence of benefits of caffeinated coffee, but cannot prove direct cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084789" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;According to the study, researchers&lt;/a&gt; didn’t find any indication that tea or decaffeinated coffee held the same benefits as caffeinated coffee. Drinking more cola was tied to a significantly lower chance of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To consume coffee moderately, you want to consider sticking to two to four cups per day,” said Youssef. “And keep in mind that one cup means 8 ounces, not a jumbo mug.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She suggests avoiding limiting sugar and high fat creamers, especially those containing processed additives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Think about flavoring your coffee with a splash of unsweetened plant milk, or cinnamon or vanilla extract, instead of syrups or flavored creamers,” Youssef said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While benefits of caffeine include improved alertness and memory support, excessive intake can cause jitteriness and insomnia, headaches or increased heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdmcd.co/k9MRKx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The research&lt;/a&gt;, led by Harvard University’s school of public health, was presented on June 2 at the American Society for Nutrition’s annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

the medications on &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/social-media"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, often illegally, and thanks to online pharmacies, it seems easier than ever to get hold of some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;While some blokes might think they've stumbled upon a miracle, it seems its all an illusion (Getty Stock)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Ozempic penis?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Well, some blokes who have been using the drug are reporting some growth downstairs, with plenty of people on Reddit noticing the 'issue'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In the comments, multiple site users confirmed they’d also seen positive change, which is certainly more than can be said to the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-health-warning-mhra-471511-20250605"&gt;less fortunate females&lt;/a&gt; who are using the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But before you go rushing to buy some, in the hope that you can gain rather than lose as most people use the jabs for, a urologist has seemingly debunked the theory about maximising your manhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is really happening?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Rather than it actually adding centimetres to your member, it seems as if the fat around the penis is actually just reducing, which gives off the illusion of things being a bit bigger - which is certainly better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Speaking to HuffPost UK, urologist Dr Martina Ambardjieva explained: “As a urologist, I can say there’s no evidence that semaglutide (Ozempic) or other GLP-1 agonists cause actual penile tissue growth,” she shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Ozempic has become very popular among those wanting to lose weight (Getty stock)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“However, there is a plausible physiological explanation for why some men perceive their penis to be larger after significant weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“When a man loses weight, particularly rapidly as with GLP-1 drugs, this fat pad shrinks, revealing more of the shaft and making the penis appear longer,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“It’s not growth, it’s exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Still, this sounds like sunshine and rainbows compared to some of the other less desirable side effects of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 14:38:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNWGRVemN5NlB6c0l3bEFxTDNya18zYmpFTVRDcnFPSXhZajJhaHF4NktmSUJuS1JLZXAwcTg4ZTRqMXY5QmhxYVpLbVNjckhidEpvUThSNC1KSXZsRGc5ekdiZWFXaU5uN0wyYXFZekdQa2lZNlp3elFvZnl6WG1iV3BtT2huOC1URHdJQjA0aE1BZkpYUk9sZzBvWVJPZzdLSFE</guid></item><item><title>针头比头发细1000倍，可替代痛苦的癌症活检-好消息网络 | Needles 1,000 Times Thinner than a Hair to Replace Painful Cancer Biopsies - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQZnRUQ1lrVDNuZTFqWElOSTBRVlpkZ1BTMkhEOE9iaUhRZVVMNm5UWkVoUVFCbjVPYk9QcDJUblBxb2JpYU5QMG81ZTNNalJ2cDhnYWNOdGQtWEloZ3pmbjQ1ekY0ZUo2OFRrekQtQWNNQVBlVFNsT0oxazBtSl80c3Aya281S2NuMDdxUTV6ZkRxNTdYbDRWdlBoV3dIeGlzR19DTE9ITTVmdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needles 1,000 times thinner than a human hair could replace painful cancer biopsies and render obsolete the traditional methods of diagnosing diseases, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patches containing tens of millions of ‘nanoneedles’ offer a “painless and less invasive” alternative for millions of patients worldwide who undergo the common biopsy in order to confirm or monitor diseases including cancer and Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But traditional biopsies can cause complications, and the pain can deter patients from seeking early diagnosis or follow-up tests. They also remove small pieces of tissue, which limits how often and how comprehensively doctors can analyze diseased organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists at King’s College London have developed a nanoneedle patch that painlessly collects molecular information from tissues—without removing or damaging them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say it could allow healthcare teams to monitor disease in real time and perform multiple, repeatable tests from the same area—something impossible with current biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the nanoneedles are so thin and don’t remove tissue, the research team found that they cause no damage or pain for patients compared to standard biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BREAKTHROUGH&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Scientists Identify New Way Cancers Sustain Themselves–and How Ginger Could Disrupt it" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/scientists-identify-new-way-cancers-sustain-themselves-and-that-ginger-could-disrupt-it/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Scientists Identify New Way Cancers Sustain Themselves–and How Ginger Could Disrupt it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have been working on nanoneedles for 12 years, but this is our most exciting development yet,” said research leader Dr. Ciro Chiappini &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/tens-millions-nanoneedles-could-replace-painful-cancer-biopsies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in a King’s College statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It opens a world of possibilities for people with brain cancer, Alzheimer’s, and for advancing personalized medicine. It will allow scientists – and eventually clinicians – to study disease in real time like never before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preclinical studies, the team applied the patch to brain cancer tissue taken from human biopsies and mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nanoneedles extracted molecular ‘fingerprints’—including lipids, proteins, and mRNAs—from cells, without removing or harming the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WOW&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Bear Shocks Vets By Going into Remission From Terminal Cancer After Taking Meds in Honey–a Rare Treat That Delights Her" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/bear-shocks-vets-by-going-into-remission-from-terminal-cancer-after-taking-meds-in-honey-a-rare-treat-that-delights-her/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Bear Shocks Vets By Going into Remission From Terminal Cancer After Taking Meds in Honey–a Rare Treat That Delights Her&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tissue imprint is then analyzed using mass spectrometry and artificial intelligence, giving doctors detailed insights into whether a tumor is present, and how it is responding to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This approach provides multidimensional molecular information from different types of cells within the same tissue,” explained Dr. Chiappini. “Traditional biopsies simply cannot do that. And because the process does not destroy the tissue, we can sample the same tissue multiple times, which was previously impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAFELY TARGETING TUMORS&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Cancer-Fighting Implant Developed to Treat Tumors by Safely Triggering Potent Immune Responses" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cancer-fighting-implant-developed-to-treat-tumors-by-safely-triggering-potent-immune-responses/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Cancer-Fighting Implant Developed to Treat Tumors by Safely Triggering Potent Immune Responses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says the patch, described in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-01955-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nature Nanotechnology&lt;/a&gt;, could be used during brain surgery to help surgeons make faster, more precise decisions: by applying the patch to a suspicious area, results could be obtained within 20 minutes and speed up decisions about removing cancerous tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made using the same manufacturing techniques as computer chips, the nanoneedles can be integrated into common medical devices such as bandages, endoscopes and contact lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INSPIRING RESEARCH&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Fighting Cancer Without Fighting: Scientists Switch Tumor Cells Back to Healthy Ones at ‘Critical’ Moment" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/fighting-cancer-without-fighting-scientists-switch-tumor-cells-back-to-healthy-ones-at-critical-moment/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Fighting Cancer Without Fighting: Scientists Switch Tumor Cells Back to Healthy Ones at ‘Critical’ Moment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This could be the beginning of the end for painful biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our technology opens up new ways to diagnose and monitor disease safely and painlessly – helping doctors and patients make better, faster decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHARE THE DEVELOPMENT With Medical Crews on Social Media…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Further, the latter can impair mental alertness and increase the risk of falls or accidents, Dr. McDanel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/study-reveals-surprising-factor-may-142500059.html" data-ylk="slk:New Study Reveals Surprising Factor That May Increase Dementia Risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Study Reveals Surprising Factor That May Increase Dementia Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This is particularly true for older adults who take this medication. “In older adults, reduced brain reserve makes them more vulnerable to these effects,” Dr. Kamboj explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In fact, Dr. Nguyen would say it’s “very risky” for elderly patients to take a high dosage of doxylamine succinate for a prolonged period. The level of risk depends on the dose, duration and individual factors, McDanel adds, like age, other medications taken and overall brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Within certain parameters, it *can* be safe—and even helpful and recommended. “Generally speaking, doxylamine can be safe when used in the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible,” Dr. McDanel says. “It is even recommended fairly regularly for &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/1-early-pregnancy-symptom-most-210000339.html" data-ylk="slk:pregnant women;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;pregnant women&lt;/a&gt; to help with &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/normal-feel-nauseous-every-day-172500216.html" data-ylk="slk:nausea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;nausea&lt;/a&gt; as it is effective for this, along with vitamin B6, and is safe for the fetus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Since the safety profile is so individualized, your best bet is to talk to your primary care provider, who knows your history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s also worth noting that when it comes to sleep, medication may not be the answer we would assume it to be. “They don’t provide the deep, restorative sleep that our brains need,” Dr. Allen says. “In fact, they can disrupt the natural sleep architecture, leading to less &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/alzheimers-dementia-rem-sleep-study-january-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:REM sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;REM sleep&lt;/a&gt;, which is crucial for memory consolidation and emotional regulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Safer, Effective Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you need more long-term support with allergies or sleep, other options are probably safer bets. Ahead, doctors share tips and treatments to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;For allergies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Try a newer antihistamine, like loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec) or fexofenadine (Allegra). Dr. Allen says they're generally safer because they don’t cross the blood-brain barrier as easily and have fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Second-generation antihistamines are also less likely to make you drowsy, a major complaint with first-generation antihistamines. “Allergists often recommend these over first-generation antihistamines due to the lower chance of causing sedation, while maintaining the same, if not more, clinical efficacy for treating allergic conditions,” Dr. McDanel adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She also encourages steroid nasal sprays, addressing underlying medical conditions and talking to your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, Dr. Nguyen mentions prescription medication, such as montelukast, and allergy shots. “Allergy immunotherapy (allergy shots) is the most effective treatment for moderate to severe allergies,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/fda-warns-severe-risk-popular-091524232.html" data-ylk="slk:FDA Warns of Newly Identified ‘Severe’ Risk of Popular Over-the-Counter Allergy Medications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FDA Warns of Newly Identified ‘Severe’ Risk of Popular Over-the-Counter Allergy Medications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;For sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you struggle with sleep, Dr. Allen has several suggestions. His first recommendation is cognitive behavioral therapy for &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/chronic-insomnia-patient-journey" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insomnia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt; (CBT-I). “This is the gold standard for chronic sleep problems,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/most-important-habit-want-8-213000424.html" data-ylk="slk:Sleep hygiene;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt; is still important too. Need a refresher on what that looks like? Dr. Allen encourages the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Establishing a consistent sleep routine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Limiting screen time before bed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Avoiding stimulants late in the day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Creating a cool, dark sleeping environment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Talking to a doctor about medication (or supplements) if necessary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Nguyen agrees that CBT-I and good sleep habits are good options. “This is considered the safest way to treat insomnia,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And again, this long-term concern about doxylamine and brain health doesn’t mean the medication is totally off limits. “Occasional use (e.g., for a bad cold or jet lag) is not known to pose major harm in healthy adults,” Dr. Kamboj says. “The concern arises with habitual or long-term use, particularly in older individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/m-brain-scientist-2-minute-172932467.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: ‘I’m a Brain Scientist, and This 2-Minute Habit Makes Me Feel 10 Times Sharper’;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: ‘I’m a Brain Scientist, and This 2-Minute Habit Makes Me Feel 10 Times Sharper’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/common-over-the-counter-medication-may-harm-brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Common Over-the-Counter Medication May Harm Brain Health, Doctors Say—Do You Take It?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;This Common Over-the-Counter Medication May Harm Brain Health, Doctors Say—Do You Take It?&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on Parade on Jun 17, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/common-over-the-counter-medication-may-harm-brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Jun 17, 2025, where it first appeared.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 14:02:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxQbUtIWVRXT04xek9TdkVvMmx0WlMyMS0tSFY0QUVTN0Jkbk1CTVJ5U1g5N2xrem5OMWwtQ0R1RWkwcUtWYUZWcFdpNHNtY1ltbXJXQjJBRkJ4LXpCMS1rZW9VSjF2cV9nV2h3ZzRTUzJ6YWhYZTlsd0szZHB3RE1Xa3JB</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，在Aldi购买排名第一的抗炎零食- EatingWell | The #1 Anti-Inflammatory Snack to Buy at Aldi, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxONGZZcm9xR05xZjEwbWJkOEY0WjlHdjBOQWdhVmk5QjNBbm9QVlpqVHp0a0hSeVk2YXZOYnlmenFScWIxbXNHN0s3Z2lzdnNpU09hNk00U2Z0TUNtZzZvVTRhSGdzc0hFMnMyRnkwa3hXMTV3LXAxVEJBd2lnMmF3dzc4M3pIUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While often associated with more expensive items, like salmon filets or goji berries, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292071/the-best-foods-to-eat-to-fight-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory foods&lt;/a&gt; don’t have to be expensive or found only at specialty stores. In fact, some of the most powerful anti-inflammatory foods are hiding in plain sight—like on the shelves at your local Aldi. While the store offers plenty of nutritious options, one standout is &lt;a href="https://shop.aldi.us/store/aldi/products/20197952-southern-grove-chopped-walnuts-8-oz" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Southern Grove Chopped Walnuts.&lt;/a&gt; We spoke with registered dietitians to understand why it’s a top snack for combating chronic inflammation and how to choose other anti-inflammatory options while cruising the aisles at Aldi.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These unsalted walnuts are more than just a crunchy snack. They’re also rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291962/8-best-vegan-omega-3-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based omega-3s&lt;/a&gt;, antioxidants and fiber, making them an ideal choice for folks looking to reduce inflammation and support overall health. Here are some of the reasons we picked Southern Grove Chopped Walnuts as the best anti-inflammatory snack at Aldi.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walnuts are an excellent source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)—a type of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acid&lt;/a&gt; your body can’t produce on its own. ALA is a short-chain omega-3 mainly found in plant foods that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-lower-inflammation-8783795" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;helps reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and support heart health, says &lt;a href="https://nourishednutritionandfitness.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Eliza Whitaker, MS, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. While walnuts are often compared to salmon for their impressive omega-3 content, it’s worth noting that ALA has to get converted into EPA and DHA—types of omega-3s found in fatty fish—and the process isn’t the most efficient. Still, don’t let that deter you from enjoying ALA-rich foods—this healthy fat still packs a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory punch.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

These compounds act as antioxidants, protecting cells from oxidative stress and inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Once digested, gut bacteria convert ellagitannins into urolithins, which have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects, particularly in the colon.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, one study found that consuming walnuts daily resulted in higher levels of urolithin A and reduced inflammatory markers in the blood and in colon tissue.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another way walnuts may help combat inflammation is through their beneficial effects on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. “Walnuts have long been studied for their gut health benefits, and they shine in this research,” says Danahy. For example, one study found significant improvements in the amount of beneficial gut bacteria in people eating a walnut-enriched diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So what do billions of microorganisms have to do with inflammation? Research consistently shows that a healthy gut microbiome helps reduce inflammation via multiple pathways, including through the production of short-chain fatty acids—anti-inflammatory compounds produced by healthy gut bacteria.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walnuts provide a unique trio of nutrients—omega-3s, vitamin E and polyphenoles—that may &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290813/mind-diet-best-foods-to-eat-to-keep-your-brain-young/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support brain health&lt;/a&gt; as you age. For instance, one review linked these nutrients with improved memory, quicker cognitive processing speed and reduced risk of neurodegenerative disease in older adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Depending on your location, one 8-ounce bag of Southern Grove Chopped Walnuts costs $3.19, which is about half the price of the same sized bag (but different brands) at stores like Safeway and WholeFoods.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omega-3s: &lt;/strong&gt;One review found that consuming &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; daily was linked with lower levels of inflammatory markers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For this reason, consider stocking up on walnuts, chia seeds, flax seeds and fatty fish, like tuna and salmon. “Even a small handful of walnuts a day can make a difference,” adds Danahy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiber: &lt;/strong&gt;Fiber supports gut health and can help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-avoid-for-chronic-inflammation-8644317" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduce systemic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Danahy suggests &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024516/best-high-fiber-snack-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;high-fiber snacks&lt;/a&gt; like oats, mixed nuts and berries. Whitaker also adds that, when it comes to snacks, pairing fiber with healthy fats can help stabilize hunger between meals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little, if Any, Added Sugar: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-eating-too-much-sugar-11721349" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Diets high in added sugar&lt;/a&gt; have been linked to increased inflammation and risk of chronic diseases. For this reason, it’s best to look for foods that are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;low in—or free of—added sugars&lt;/a&gt;. “Choosing whole-food snacks over ultra-processed ones is an easy way to avoid excess sugar,” says Whitaker.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aldi’s Southern Grove Chopped Walnuts is an unassuming pantry staple that packs an impressive nutritional punch. Thanks to their omega-3, fiber and antioxidant content, walnuts are an excellent snack choice if you’re looking to lower inflammation and support gut and brain health. The unsalted, pre-chopped walnuts at Aldi makes it easy to sprinkle them over oatmeal, yogurt or salads. And remember: walnuts are just one of many anti-inflammatory foods &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-food-experts-buy-at-aldi-11725240" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;available at Aldi&lt;/a&gt;. Pair these chopped nuts with whole grains, fatty fish and a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to get the most benefit.

Among 374 adults aged 19 to 82, age, blood pressure, and BMI were the top predictors of success on a focus-and-speed-based attention test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While diet and exercise played a smaller role, they were still associated with better outcomes, particularly in offsetting high BMI or blood pressure. This data-driven approach highlights how combining multiple factors provides a clearer picture of what supports brain health with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Predictors:&lt;/strong&gt; Age, diastolic blood pressure, and BMI most strongly influenced cognitive performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet + Exercise:&lt;/strong&gt; Healthy eating and physical activity contributed modestly but positively to focus and reaction speed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning Advantage:&lt;/strong&gt; Advanced algorithms revealed nuanced relationships traditional statistics may miss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study offers insight into the health and lifestyle indicators — including diet, physical activity and weight — that align most closely with healthy brain function across the lifespan. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used machine learning to determine which variables best predicted a person’s ability to quickly complete a task without becoming distracted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110955"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AI-brain-health-neuroscince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AI-brain-health-neuroscince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AI-brain-health-neuroscince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AI-brain-health-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AI-brain-health-neuroscince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AI-brain-health-neuroscince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AI-brain-health-neuroscince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AI-brain-health-neuroscince.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AI-brain-health-neuroscince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AI-brain-health-neuroscince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AI-brain-health-neuroscince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AI-brain-health-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AI-brain-health-neuroscince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AI-brain-health-neuroscince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AI-brain-health-neuroscince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They found that age was the most influential predictor of performance on the test, followed by diastolic blood pressure, BMI and systolic blood pressure. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reported in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, the study found that age, blood pressure and body mass index were the strongest predictors of success on a test called the flanker task, which requires participants to focus on a central object without becoming distracted by flanking information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet and exercise also played a smaller but relevant role in performance on the test, the team found, sometimes appearing to offset the ill effects of a high BMI or other potentially detrimental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study used machine learning to evaluate a host of variables at once to help identify those that align most closely with cognitive performance,” said Naiman Khan, a professor of health and kinesiology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who led the work with kinesiology Ph.D. student Shreya Verma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Standard statistical approaches cannot embrace this level of complexity all at once.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build the model, the team used data collected from 374 adults 19 to 82 years of age. The data included participant demographics, such as age, BMI, blood pressure and physical activity levels, along with dietary patterns and performance on a flanker test that measured their processing speed and accuracy in determining the orientation of a central arrow flanked by other arrows that pointed in the same or opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a well-established measure of cognitive function that assesses attention and inhibitory control,” Khan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have found that several factors are implicated in the preservation of cognitive function across the lifespan, Khan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adherence to the healthy eating index, a measure of diet quality, has been linked to superior executive function and processing speed in older adults,” he said. “Other studies have found that diets that are rich in antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins are associated with better cognitive function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH diet, the Mediterranean diet, and a diet that combines the two, called the MIND diet, all “have been linked to protective effects against cognitive decline and dementia,” the researchers wrote. Physical factors, such as BMI and blood pressure, along with increased physical activity also are strong predictors of cognitive health, or decline, in aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clearly, cognitive health is driven by a host of factors, but which ones are most important?” Verma said. “We wanted to evaluate the relative strength of each of these factors in combination with all the others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning “offers a promising avenue for analyzing large datasets with multiple variables and identifying patterns that may not be apparent through conventional statistical approaches,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested various machine learning algorithms to see which one best weighed the various factors to predict the speed of accurate responses in the flanker test. The researchers tested the predictive ability of each algorithm, using a variety of approaches to validate those that appeared to perform the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that age was the most influential predictor of performance on the test, followed by diastolic blood pressure, BMI and systolic blood pressure. Adherence to the healthy eating index was less predictive of cognitive performance than blood pressure or BMI but also correlated with better performance on the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Physical activity emerged as a moderate predictor of reaction time, with results suggesting it may interact with other lifestyle factors, such as diet and body weight, to influence cognitive performance,” Khan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study reveals how machine learning can bring precision and nuance to the field of nutritional neuroscience,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By moving beyond traditional approaches, machine learning could help tailor strategies for aging populations, individuals with metabolic risks or those seeking to enhance cognitive function through lifestyle changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Personalized Nutrition Initiative and National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the U. of I. supported this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khan is a dietitian and an affiliate faculty member of the Division of Nutritional Sciences, the Neuroscience Program and the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and brain health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5c3835253d1c353030353233352f72393829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Diana Yates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://illinois.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Diana Yates – University of Illinois&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2025.05.003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Predicting cognitive outcome through nutrition and health markers using supervised machine learning&lt;/a&gt;” by Naiman Khan et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predicting cognitive outcome through nutrition and health markers using supervised machine learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0015"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning (ML) use in health research is growing, yet its application to predict cognitive outcomes using diverse health indicators is underinvestigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used ML models to predict cognitive performance based on a set of health and behavioral factors, aiming to identify key contributors to cognitive function for insights into potential personalized interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from 374 adults aged 19–82 y (227 females) were used to develop ML models predicting cognitive performance (reaction time in milliseconds) on a modified Eriksen flanker task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Features included demographics, anthropometric measures, dietary indices (Healthy Eating Index, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, Mediterranean, and Mediterranean–Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay), self-reported physical activity, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The data set was split (80:20) for training and testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predictive models (decision trees, random forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, gradient boosting, linear, ridge, and lasso regression) were used with hyperparameter tuning and crossvalidation. Feature importance was calculated using permutation importance, whereas performance using mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Random forest regressor exhibited the best performance, with the lowest MAE (training: 0.66 ms; testing: 0.78 ms) and mean squared error (training: 0.70 ms&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; testing: 1.05 ms&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Age was the most significant feature (score: 0.208), followed by diastolic blood pressure (0.169), BMI (0.079), systolic blood pressure (0.069), and Healthy Eating Index (0.048).

              &lt;p&gt;Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that often causes sudden and intense shortness of breath. The disease impacts around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/asthma"&gt;339 million&lt;/a&gt; people worldwide, and in the U.S. nine people on average die from asthma &lt;a href="https://aafa.org/asthma/asthma-facts/"&gt;every&lt;/a&gt; day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers in the U.K. have found that women who work night shifts are more likely to have moderate or severe asthma than women who work during the day. The study, published Monday in the journal &lt;a href="https://publications.ersnet.org/content/erjor/early/2025/05/28/2312054100137-2025"&gt;ERJ Open Research&lt;/a&gt;, does not reveal any such tendency in men working nightshifts, and could hold important implications for public health guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team had previously shown that permanent night shift workers in general are more likely to suffer from moderate-severe asthma compared to day workers. Scientists also know that asthma is more prevalent and severe in adult &lt;a href="https://publications.ersnet.org/content/errev/30/162/210067"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt; than adult men. “Since increasing numbers of females are becoming shift workers it is important to determine if shift work-associated asthma risk is higher in females,” the researchers wrote in the study. &lt;a href="https://www.nwhealthlaporte.com/shift-work"&gt;Shift&lt;/a&gt; work refers to scheduled working periods that fall outside of traditional daytime hours. “Our main aim was to investigate sex differences in the association between shift work and asthma.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers did so by analyzing data belonging to over 274,541 working people from the U.K. Biobank, a biomedical database open to health researchers. From this initial pool, they found that 5.3% had asthma, and 1.9% of those had moderate or severe asthma. The team then looked into whether the people in these categories worked during the day, during nightshifts, or a mix of both.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that female shift workers in general are more likely to suffer from asthma, and women who only work nightshifts have 50% higher likelihood of developing moderate or severe asthma than female daytime workers. Furthermore, the risk increases “with both number of monthly night shifts and longer lifetime duration of night shift work,” they explained. Interestingly, the data did not reveal any differences in the prevalence of asthma in men based on their work schedule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This type of research cannot explain why shift work and asthma are linked,” Robert Maidstone, a co-author of the study and a researcher at the University of Manchester’s School of Biological Sciences, said in a university &lt;a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/women-who-work-nightshifts-are-more-likely-to-have-asthma/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “However, it could be because shift work disrupts the body clock, including the levels of male and female sex hormones. High testosterone has previously been shown to be protective against asthma, and so lower testosterone in women could play a role. Alternatively, men and women work different types of shift jobs, and this could be a factor.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among women not taking hormone replacement therapy (&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/15245-hormone-therapy-for-menopause-symptoms"&gt;HRT&lt;/a&gt;, a treatment for menopausal symptoms), postmenopausal women working only night shifts were almost twice as likely to have moderate-severe asthma than female day workers. This suggests that HRT might protect nightshift workers from asthma, though the researchers admit that more studies are needed to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This research suggests that working nightshifts could be a risk factor for asthma in women, but not in men. The majority of workers will not have an easy option of switching their shift pattern, so we need further research to verify and understand this link and find out what could be done to reduce the risk for women who work shifts,” explained Florence Schleich from the European Respiratory Society, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the researchers aim to investigate how sex hormones might influence asthma prevalence among shift workers. Perhaps this line of research will also shed light on what drives the respiratory disease, given that the exact &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/asthma/causes"&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

That ultimately lowers the amount of cholesterol circulating in your blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“On the inflammation side, beans deliver a strong one-two punch," he adds. "Their fiber feeds beneficial gut bacteria, which produce short-chain fatty acids like butyrate that calm systemic inflammation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But that's not all. Beans also contain polyphenols, a type of antioxidant that helps reduce inflammation by lowering oxidative stress and supporting the body’s natural inflammatory response, says &lt;a href="https://kerigansny.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-node-id="16.1" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://kerigansny.com/" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Keri Gans" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Keri Gans&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, dietitian and host of &lt;em data-node-id="16.3"&gt;The Keri Report&lt;/em&gt; podcast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-do-i-need-to-eat-each-day-to-see-these-effects" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;How much do I need to eat each day to see these effects&lt;/strong&gt;? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This particular study looked at the health impact of eating a cup of beans per day.

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee drinkers who consumed 1-3 cups daily had a 15-17% lower risk of dying early compared to non-coffee drinkers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health benefits only applied to black coffee or coffee with minimal added sugar (less than half a teaspoon per cup) and saturated fat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee drinks high in sugar and saturated fat showed no protective effects, potentially eliminating coffee’s health benefits entirely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEDFORD, Mass. —&lt;/strong&gt; Americans love their coffee, with about half of us reaching for a cup every single day. And here’s some news that might make your morning brew taste even better: that daily coffee habit could be cutting your risk of dying early by up to 17% — but there’s a catch that could cancel out the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study tracking nearly 50,000 American adults for more than a decade found that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/coffee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;coffee drinkers&lt;/a&gt; lived longer than those who skipped their daily caffeine fix. The twist? The life-extending benefits were only seen in people who drank black coffee or coffee with very little added sugar and saturated fat. Those sugary, creamy coffee shop drinks? They offered no measurable health advantage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the study, coffee with higher levels of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/added-sugar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;added sugar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/saturated-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; was not associated with lower death rates. Moreover, the benefits were not seen in people who preferred a decaf brew. The research took a detailed look at what Americans are actually putting in their coffee, and the findings raise red flags about our sweetened coffee culture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nearly-50-000-americans-tracked-for-over-a-decade"&gt;Nearly 50,000 Americans Tracked for Over a Decade&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Tufts University analyzed coffee drinking habits and health outcomes in 46,322 adults aged 20 and older who participated in U.S. government health surveys between 1999 and 2018. Participants were followed for roughly 9 to 11 years, with actual mortality outcomes tracked using National Death Index records.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During that time, 7,074 participants died — 1,176 from &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/cancer/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and 1,089 from &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to non-coffee drinkers, those who drank coffee had significantly lower mortality rates. The greatest benefit appeared in people drinking 2 to 3 cups a day, who had a 17% lower risk of dying during the follow-up period. Even those who drank less than a cup a day saw an 11% lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-sweetened-coffee-may-cancel-the-health-benefits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Sweetened Coffee May Cancel the Health Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined what went into those cups of coffee. Each beverage was classified based on how much added sugar and saturated fat it contained per 8-ounce serving.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Drinking &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/strongest-coffees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;black coffee&lt;/a&gt; was associated with a 14% lower risk of all-cause mortality. Coffee with small amounts of added sugar (under 2.5 grams per cup) and saturated fat (under 1 gram per cup) also showed the same 14% reduction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But for people drinking coffee with higher amounts of sugar and saturated fat, there was no statistically significant reduction &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/drinking-coffee-only-in-the-morning-lowers-risk-of-death-from-any-cause/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;in risk of death&lt;/a&gt;. For context, the average U.S. coffee drink contains 3.24 grams of added sugar and 0.52 grams of saturated fat per 8-ounce cup, suggesting that many Americans are overshooting the threshold where coffee may offer health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caffeine-key-to-longevity"&gt;Caffeine Key to Longevity&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002231662500286X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,  also found that caffeinated coffee — not decaf — was driving most of the observed health benefits. While &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/best-decaf-coffee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;decaffeinated coffee&lt;/a&gt; showed no clear association with longevity, caffeinated coffee was linked to reduced risk of death from both all causes and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s in line with previous research suggesting that caffeine &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/caffeine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;may play a protective role&lt;/a&gt; by boosting metabolism, reducing inflammation, and improving insulin sensitivity. Coffee also contains other bioactive compounds like chlorogenic acid and polyphenols that are thought to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the protective effects of coffee were only observed among people who did not drink tea. Among &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/tea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tea drinkers&lt;/a&gt;, the association between coffee and longevity disappeared, though the study doesn’t explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-s-best-to-be-basic"&gt;It’s Best To Be Basic&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the estimated 150 million Americans who drink coffee daily, this study delivers both a bit of good news and a wake-up call. The good news: your coffee habit could be helping you live longer. The reality check: if your go-to drink includes lots of sugar, cream, or flavored syrups, those potential benefits may be lost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers adjusted for a wide range of lifestyle and health variables, including age, sex, race, income, smoking, alcohol use, exercise, diet quality, and preexisting conditions. Even then, the association between simple coffee and lower mortality still held up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The takeaway? A basic &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/coffee/"&gt;cup of coffee&lt;/a&gt;, especially when consumed black or lightly sweetened, may be one of the healthiest parts of your day. But when that cup starts to resemble dessert and doesn’t have caffeine, the health perks may disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted between 1999 and 2018, focusing on 46,322 adults aged 20 and older. They tracked coffee consumption using detailed 24-hour dietary recalls and categorized coffee types based on caffeine content and amounts of added sugar and saturated fat. Participants were followed for a median of 9.3 to 11.3 years, with mortality data obtained through linkage to the National Death Index through December 2019.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the follow-up period, 7,074 deaths occurred. Coffee consumption of 1-3 cups per day was associated with 15-17% lower all-cause mortality risk. The greatest benefit was seen with 2-3 cups daily (17% reduction). However, mortality benefits were limited to black coffee and coffee with low added sugar (&amp;lt;2.5g per cup) and low saturated fat (&amp;lt;1g per cup). Coffee with high levels of sugar and saturated fat showed no protective effects. The benefits were primarily associated with caffeinated rather than decaffeinated coffee. For cardiovascular disease mortality analysis, only data from 1999-2014 cycles were used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study relied on one or two days of dietary recalls, which may not capture typical long-term intake patterns. Coffee consumption correlates with various lifestyle factors, and while researchers adjusted for known confounders, residual confounding cannot be ruled out. The study couldn’t distinguish between different types of cancer deaths due to small numbers, and information about coffee preparation methods wasn’t available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (award number R01MD011501). One author (FFZ) reported financial support from NIH, while all other authors reported no conflicts of interest. The funding sources had no role in study design, data collection, analysis, or manuscript preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

This triggered a red alert across one of America’s most populous regions. Though vaccinated, she was contagious for over a week, from May 30 to June 7, potentially exposing thousands at locations in Dallas and nearby Plano, according to a report of Daily Mail. This is the first reported case in Dallas amid a larger outbreak that has already infected nearly 800 people statewide and claimed the lives of two children. The case has raised alarm bells as health officials race to contain what’s been dubbed the world’s most contagious disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First case of measles sparks alarm amid ongoing Texas outbreak&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infected woman visited Lemma Coffee in downtown Plano on May 31 and the First Baptist Church on June 1. Authorities are now tracking her movements and notifying potentially exposed individuals. Although this is currently classified as an isolated incident, it coincides with a growing outbreak across Texas — with 744 confirmed cases and 96 hospitalizations since January. Two deaths have been reported in unvaccinated school-aged children, intensifying the public health response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why measles is one of the most dangerous and contagious viruses in the world&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is far from a harmless childhood illness. It spreads through the air and remains active on surfaces for up to two hours, infecting 90% of unvaccinated people exposed to it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms begin with a fever, cough, and runny nose, but rapidly develop into tell-tale red rashes and small white spots inside the mouth. If untreated or contracted by vulnerable individuals, it can lead to severe complications such as pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccinated but still infected: Understanding breakthrough measles cases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the woman in Dallas was fully vaccinated, rare "breakthrough" infections can occur. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective after two doses, but no vaccine offers absolute protection. Still, vaccinated individuals typically experience milder symptoms and are less likely to transmit the disease. The greatest concern lies with the unvaccinated population, especially children under 5 and individuals with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;CDC issues travel advisory: Airports and crowded spaces can be hotspots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC warns that travelers are at heightened risk, especially in crowded places like airports, train stations, and large events. Infected travelers can unknowingly carry the virus across state and national borders, spreading it to communities with lower vaccination coverage. The advisory urges travelers to verify their immunity and ensure they’re up to date on MMR vaccinations before flying, particularly to or from international destinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Falling vaccination rates are fueling measles’ dangerous comeback&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A troubling national trend is worsening the outbreak: childhood MMR vaccination rates are slipping. A Johns Hopkins University study found that 78% of US. counties saw declines in MMR coverage in 2024. The national average now stands at 91% — well below the 95% threshold needed to maintain herd immunity. If this continues, measles could shift from an occasional threat to a recurring public health crisis, reversing the US.

These neural signals coordinate dynamically, especially during moments of decision-making, allowing people to maintain focus and adapt more quickly to changing rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used EEG recordings from 148 participants as they completed cognitive control tasks, revealing that smarter brains operate more like adaptable orchestras than metronomes. This flexible brain rhythm coordination could be a key neural signature of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theta Synchrony:&lt;/strong&gt; Midfrontal theta wave synchronization increases during key decision moments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Stronger, flexible theta coordination is associated with higher cognitive ability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptability Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Intelligence may depend more on dynamic rhythm shifts than on constant brainwave activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the brain is under pressure, certain neural signals begin to move in sync – much like a well-rehearsed orchestra. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU) is the first to show how flexibly this neural synchrony adjusts to different situations and that this dynamic coordination is closely linked to cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110943"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These brainwaves oscillate between four and eight hertz and belong to the group of slower neural frequencies. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Specific signals in the midfrontal brain region are better synchronized in people with higher cognitive ability – especially during demanding phases of reasoning,” explained Professor Anna-Lena Schubert from JGU’s Institute of Psychology, lead author of the study recently published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: General.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on the midfrontal area of the brain and the measurable coordination of the so-called theta waves. These brainwaves oscillate between four and eight hertz and belong to the group of slower neural frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They tend to appear when the brain is particularly challenged such as during focused thinking or when we need to consciously control our behavior,” said Schubert, who heads the Analysis and Modeling of Complex Data Lab at JGU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being able to focus even next to a buzzing phone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 148 participants in the study, aged between 18 and 60, first completed tests assessing memory and intelligence before their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method measures tiny electrical signals in the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp and is a well-established technique for gaining precise insights into cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During EEG recording, participants completed three mentally demanding tasks designed to assess cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were interested in the participants’ ability to flexibly shift between changing rules, which is an essential aspect of intelligent information processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, participants had to press a button to decide whether a number was even or odd, and moments later whether it was greater or less than five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each switch of rules required rapid adjustment of mental strategies – a process that allowed researchers to closely observe how the brain’s networks coordinate in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, individuals with higher cognitive abilities showed especially strong synchronization of theta waves during crucial moments, particularly when making decisions. Their brains were better at sustaining purposeful thought when it mattered most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People with stronger midfrontal theta connectivity are often better at maintaining focus and tuning out distractions, be it that your phone buzzes while you’re working or that you intend to read a book in a busy train station,” explained Schubert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A flexible rhythm in the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Anna-Lena Schubert was particularly surprised by how closely this brain rhythm coordination was tied to cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did not expect the relationship to be this clear,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What mattered most was not continuous synchronization, but the brain’s ability to adapt its timing flexibly and contextually – like an orchestra that follows a skilled conductor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The midfrontal region often sets the tone in this coordination but works in concert with other areas across the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This midfrontal theta connectivity appears to be particularly relevant during the execution of decisions, however not during the preparatory mental adjustment to new task rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous EEG studies on cognitive ability mostly examined activity in isolated brain regions. In contrast, this study took a network-level approach, examining how different areas interact across multiple tasks to identify stable, overarching patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings show that individual differences in cognitive ability are linked to the brain’s dynamic network behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Potential applications such as brain-based training tools or diagnostics are still a long way off,” emphasized Schubert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But our study offers important groundwork for understanding how intelligence functions at a neural level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow-up study, now seeking participants aged 40 and older from the Rhine-Main region, will explore which biological and cognitive factors further support this kind of efficient brain coordination and the role of additional cognitive abilities, such as processing speed and working memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and intelligence research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cca7adb8a4bea5a2e2baa3a5abb88cb9a2a5e1a1ada5a2b6e2a8a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kathrin Voigt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uni-mainz.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kathrin Voigt – Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xge0001780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Trait characteristics of midfrontal theta connectivity as a neurocognitive measure of cognitive control and its relation to general cognitive abilities&lt;/a&gt;” by Anna-Lena Schubert et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: General&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trait characteristics of midfrontal theta connectivity as a neurocognitive measure of cognitive control and its relation to general cognitive abilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the neurocognitive basis of cognitive control and its relationship with general cognitive ability is a key challenge in individual differences research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigates midfrontal theta connectivity as a neurocognitive marker for individual differences in cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using electroencephalography, we examined midfrontal global theta connectivity across three distinct cognitive control tasks in 148 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings reveal that midfrontal theta connectivity can be modeled as a trait-like latent variable, indicating its consistency across tasks and stability over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the reliability of the observed measures was found to be low to moderate, suggesting substantial measurement error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also replicated previous results, finding a strong correlation (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.64) between midfrontal theta connectivity and cognitive abilities, especially during higher order stages of information processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We disentangled the specific cognitive processes contributing to this relationship by employing a task-cueing paradigm with distinct cue and target intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicated that only theta connectivity during response-related processes, not during cue-evoked task-set reconfiguration, correlated with cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights significantly advance theoretical models of intelligence, highlighting the critical role of specific aspects of cognitive control in cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

But they need to know what to expect from the treatment that they’re choosing, and that needs to be guided by real-world data, not clinical trial data,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Naveed Sattar, of the University of Glasgow, who was not involved in the work, pointed to recent follow-up studies of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/11/people-using-drug-mounjaro-sustain-weight-loss-over-three-years-trial-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;trials involving tirzepatide&lt;/a&gt; showing substantial weight loss over three years. But he said in real life many patients stop medicines early either because of their cost or poorly handled side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“That said, bariatric surgery done well can do well for many people and is certainly cheaper over the longer run,” he said. “The issue may be that most people likely prefer to take medicines for weight loss rather than have surgery, at least in the first instance, now that the medicines can approach weight loss levels seen with surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 12:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixgFBVV95cUxPSDRIV29pU1dsaEhDT1V0NkJQVjl2ZzJZNXNUVVk5dEM4bERnbFlndzFGUl9HM2RvT2RYaTc0NXZyQ0NrMVhvM3Uwa2dWMm9OMlNXUkVJME1Ha0VIMkZjOFVjeENVTDRCdWVFa3VDNUo5aFhKemdER01lUWE1eHo0Zm5PLWQ1ZW13bUs4UmgwTkltaTg4dUFaS1pXaWp1Q3FVVWxKLUxad3VfN3RrOG5LV3E3RmJwdW5uTmVRUXpyR0l2VEVqcFE</guid></item><item><title>大便中的某些东西可能预示着即将到来的死亡- ScienceAlert | Something in Your Poop May Predict an Imminent Death - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOaEdKV0VGdDNzQm1sWTdDTkNzZ1djWThGMEx6TVF4dDdXWUVnUDVCU0MxbGZrTkcwV1hPQVJLWVViRG4weTdaM09BWlU4MWxQZ0EzYnNNNklIbTFDMlFaZGNUbHVhYUVsRUh5Z3lkMXJBLUtiU1BKSmQ1N2hFZjAyVEVxZUVzV2lL?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The contents of a patient's entrails could be key to assessing how close they are to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, it's not some form of living &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruspex"&gt;haruspicy&lt;/a&gt;. A team of doctors led by Alexander de Porto of the University of Chicago and the University of Amsterdam has created an index of markers in a patient's feces that can help gauge the risk of mortality within 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have named it the metabolic dysbiosis score (MDS), and it could help save the lives of critically ill patients in medical intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results, they caution, require further investigation and validation, but offer exciting promise as a future tool for diagnostic medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The findings suggest that fecal metabolic dysbiosis, quantified through the MDS, holds potential as a biomarker to identify critically ill patients at increased risk of mortality," de Porto and his colleagues, Eric Pamer and Bhakti Patel of the University of Chicago, told ScienceAlert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This underscores the importance of gut-derived metabolites as independent contributors to host resilience, offering an avenue for precision medicine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164803" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164803" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/fecal-bacteria-642x557.jpg" alt="A Patient's Poop Could Predict How Likely They Are to Die Within 30 Days" class="wp-image-164803 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/fecal-bacteria-642x557.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/fecal-bacteria-479x415.jpg 479w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/fecal-bacteria-768x666.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/fecal-bacteria-1536x1332.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/fecal-bacteria-600x520.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/fecal-bacteria.jpg 1859w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164803" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Scanning electron micrograph of bacteria cultured from a sample of human feces. (Steve Gschmeissner/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units often develop severe syndromes such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt; and acute respiratory distress – but these syndromes don't always develop and evolve in the same way. This heterogeneity poses a huge challenge for trying to treat these patients; two patients with the same syndrome may respond to the same treatment very differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to circumvent this challenge, the researchers said, is to identify specific traits to treat rather than attacking the whole syndrome at once. Scientists know that critically ill patients often have reduced diversity in their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-strange-world-of-organisms-lives-inside-you-but-not-like-you-think"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt;, as well as altered concentrations of the metabolites produced by their microbiomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;De Porto and his colleagues embarked on an investigation into &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/changes-in-gut-bacteria-are-present-long-before-signs-of-parkinsons-appear"&gt;dysbiosis&lt;/a&gt;, an imbalance in the gut microbiome, in critically ill patients, as a trait that could be treated. They studied fecal samples collected from 196 patients exhibiting respiratory failure or shock, dividing them into a training cohort of 147 patients and a validation cohort of 49 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used these samples to develop the MDS, based on concentrations of 13 distinct fecal metabolites. The results indicate an auspicious avenue for further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The MDS performed well in predicting mortality in the training cohort of medical ICU patients, with 84 percent accuracy, 89 percent sensitivity, and 71 percent specificity," the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, the validation cohort, despite showing similar trends, failed to reach statistical significance, probably due to its smaller sample size. These findings highlight the promise of the MDS but also underscore the necessity to validate its predictive capacity and generalizability in independent cohorts before widespread application."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the researchers found particularly interesting is that, even though a lack of diversity in the microbiome has previously been associated with adverse outcomes in critically ill patients, they could find no such link. Instead, their results showed a strong link between dysbiosis and increased mortality risk, suggesting that an imbalance in the microbiome plays a crucial role in patient health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot more work needs to be done before the team's approach is suitable for clinical application. The null result in the validation cohort of just 47 patients shows that quite a bit of refinement is required. However, there are several encouraging points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab has shown, for instance, that fecal metabolites can identify liver transplant patients who have a higher risk of developing a post-operative infection. In addition, while specific treatments have not yet been investigated or identified, the MDS indicates some pathways for further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The metabolites comprising the score, such as short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and tryptophan metabolites, point to biological pathways that might be targeted therapeutically," the researchers said. "Potential interventions might include dietary changes, administration of probiotics, or direct supplementation with these metabolites."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to work on validating MDS in new sets of patients, and to examine whether the link between the observed dysbioses and the increased mortality risk is causal or symptomatic of another cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Subsequently," the researchers said, "intervention trials targeting specific metabolites or metabolic pathways are necessary to assess therapeutic benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adt1466"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It may help improve physical performance, strength, and energy during short workouts. Creatine may also help protect your body from inflammation and cell damage. It's in foods like beef, pork, and seafood, as well as supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Creatine makes adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a substance that gives energy to muscles. It also helps prevent &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/fitness/delayed-onset-muscle-soreness-doms" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;muscle soreness&lt;/a&gt; by reducing &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/lactic-acid-7255194" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lactate&lt;/a&gt; build-up.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When taking creatine supplements, you typically start with 20 grams daily for up to seven days, followed by three to five grams daily for up to 12 weeks. Starting with a larger "loading dose" may increase how much creatine your body stores. This higher storage can help you perform at a higher intensity and recover more quickly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Weight gain is the most common side effect of creatine. Creatine draws water into your muscles, also known as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/water-retention-8710716" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;water retention&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; BCAAs may work well for people whose main goal is muscle growth. Amino acids are necessary for making proteins, which you need to grow and maintain muscle.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; BCAA supplements may help people who don't consume enough protein daily. It won't improve muscle mass in people who meet their daily protein requirement, which is at least 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight per day. Taking protein supplements that contain BCAAs, such as&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/whey-protein-7376427" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; whey&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/casein-protein-7964442" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; casein&lt;/a&gt;, helps you meet your daily protein intake.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adults aged 57-70 may benefit from taking creatine since it can improve muscle mass and strength, two factors that become more important as you age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Using creatine when you're older can help:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve balance and stability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the ability to complete tasks independently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower the risk of age-related diseases, such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/condition/osteoporosis-overview" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt; (bone thinning and weakening)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Combining creatine with&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/heavy-light-all-weightlifting-builds-muscle-7571500" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; resistance training&lt;/a&gt;, such as push-ups, sit-ups, and crunches, can provide more health benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vegetarians may also benefit from taking creatine. This is because creatine is naturally found mainly in meat and dairy products.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; BCAAs and creatine are safe to use together. BCAAs can help with muscle protein production and repair, while creatine helps with energy and strength.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can safely take these supplements at the same time. For example, if you use powder supplements, you can mix both in the same drink or smoothie. If you take them together, check to make sure they don’t contain any other ingredients that shouldn't be mixed. Your healthcare provider can help you review the label.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; BCAAs and creatine are popular fitness supplements used to improve your overall workout performance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; BCAAs can help your physical activity by lowering your risk of muscle damage and soreness, and creatine can help improve energy and strength during workouts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

As a treatment for people already living with HIV, it costs &lt;a href="https://www.pharmexec.com/view/new-beginnings-sunlenca" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;about $39,000 annually&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It could, however, be made for only $25 (£18.40) a year – including a 30% profit margin – analysis from the University of Liverpool and others suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Andrew Hill, one of the researchers, said making lenacapavir unaffordable in countries with HIV epidemics would only make things worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Even high-income countries will not be able to afford wide scale use of lenacapavir at prices above $20,000 a year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hill &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/23/hiv-aids-prevention-vaccine-lenacapavir-sunlenca-pharmaceuticals-gilead-generic-licensing" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;had calculated a generic price of $40 annually&lt;/a&gt; last year, but said the interest from generic manufacturers had warranted new analysis. This showed lenacapavir could be mass produced for $35 to $46 a year, if there was annual demand for 2m doses, falling to $25 at scaled up production of 5m to 10m doses each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In 2023 there were 1.3m new HIV infections. The World Health Organization says &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/countries-take-up-new-who-recommendations-on-self-testing-for-prep-and-pep" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;about 10 million people need to take HIV prevention drugs&lt;/a&gt; in order to achieve global goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Winnie Byanyima, UNAids executive director, said: “We have been urging Gilead to make lenacapavir available and affordable for all who need it. Dr Hill’s research indicates that this gamechanging innovation could – within a year of launch – be produced and sold for just $25 per person per year. To charge 1,000 times more for a medicine with pandemic-ending potential would be abhorrent. We cannot end Aids with medicines that are so costly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Amid &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/18/global-health-trump-usaid-cuts-hiv-aids-2030-drugs-vaccine-research-africa" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;widespread fears that aid cuts will see a reversal of decades of progress &lt;/a&gt;in controlling HIV, Byanyima said long-acting preventive medicines such as lenacapavir could offer a breakthrough for countries and “turn off the tap of new infections”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She called on Gilead to “do the right thing, save countless lives, and end this pandemic”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="549b0bfe-ab5c-451b-812b-a99bfe4bd7b4" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":12,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Breakthrough in search for HIV cure leaves researchers ‘overwhelmed’","elementId":"549b0bfe-ab5c-451b-812b-a99bfe4bd7b4","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jun/05/breakthrough-in-search-for-hiv-cure-leaves-researchers-overwhelmed"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Gilead &lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2024/gilead-signs-royalty-free-voluntary-licensing-agreements-with-six-generic-manufacturers-to-increase-access-to-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention-in-high-incidence-resource-limited-countries" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has agreements with six generic companies&lt;/a&gt; to allow the production of low-cost versions of lenacapavir for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/03/gamechanger-hiv-prevention-drug-to-be-made-available-cheaply-in-120-countries" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;120 low-income countries&lt;/a&gt;, and has promised to supply doses for about 2 million people at no profit before generic supplies come to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;European regulatory approvals, &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/leaflet/infographic-medicines-use-outside-eu-eu-m4all_en.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;facilitating approval in many low- and middle-income countries&lt;/a&gt;, are expected later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But campaigners say countries where a third of new HIV cases occur are excluded by the Gilead scheme – including Brazil, Argentina, and parts of eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a statement, Gilead said the company “understands the importance of access for lenacapavir for PrEP [pre-exposure prophylaxis] if it is approved, and we’re taking steps at unprecedented speed to plan for access to lenacapavir for PrEP globally – particularly in low- and lower-middle-income countries where the need is greatest”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The company said external price estimates were based on assumptions of higher use of HIV prevention drugs than currently, or projected. It said global price planning was in progress and would take into account “nearly two decades of research and development, constant learning and iteration, and manufacturing investments to deliver lenacapavir at scale”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 11:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPNmFEZ0FMd1VqNXVldDVjZmlaVGI5MHpXUGdyR2pacDF2THQ0R1R1MlBNMEQwUUhFNnNtX0Q1RTJHcHRXOUhBN3V3azMwdHBhY080S3BRSkRfQXlDOU0tbEpSMTJHOFZCdVBTNkh6YUpJTExvc0ZFVlo1X2VySjktVm9sUG9jQUFJTmdSU1kySTB2dE1pdGZtZjVxQ3JZaDNLcExkbEhpYXVKQXhBX0tyRw</guid></item><item><title>SHOCK研究发现，在减肥方面，一次性治疗比Ozempic更好……因为精神疾病之间存在联系--《每日邮报》 | Shock study finds one-off treatment better than Ozempic for weight loss... as psychiatric disorders are linked - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A one-off weight-loss treatment that has been around since the 1950s is far superior than drugs like Ozempic when it comes to shifting pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A major new study found bariatric surgery - which involves reducing the size of the stomach - is up to five times more effective than the blockbuster new shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-679cb970-4ad1-11f0-ac14-c5c1547e8386" class=""&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;About 40million Americans and 500,000 Brits report taking weight loss drugs like Ozempic or Wegovy at some point in their lives (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors of both studies warned patients looking to lose weight should considered these risks before starting a weight loss shot or opting for surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Avery Brown, lead author of the first study and surgical resident at NYU Langone Health, said: 'Clinical trials show weight loss between 15 percent to 21 percent for GLP-1s, but this study suggests that weight loss in the real world is considerably lower even for patients who have active prescriptions for an entire year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We know as many as 70 percent of patients may discontinue treatment within one year.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in eight Americans - about 43million - report taking a GLP-1 agonist like Ozempic or Wegovy at some point in their lives, along with 500,000 in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And recent research shows their popularity has soared 600 percent since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, 300,000 Americans and 7,000 Brits undergo weight loss surgery each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These surgeries involve decreasing the size of the stomach or changing how the digestive system works to make patients eat less and lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both studies were unveiled this week at the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting in Washington DC. Neither team has published the full results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first study looked at 51,085 patients from NYU Langone Health and NYC Health + Hospitals who had bariatric surgery or were prescribed semaglutide of tirzepatide - the active ingredients in Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro between 2018 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who had surgery underwent either sleeve gastrectomy or Roux en-Y gastric bypass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The former reduces stomach size by 80 percent by creating a sleeve-like shape, while the former creates a small pouch and connects it directly to the small intestine so it bypasses part of the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the course of two years, surgical patients on average lost 58 pounds or 24 percent of their total body weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those taking GLP-1s for six months lost 12 pounds or 4.7 percent of their total body weight, while patients who stuck to the shots for a year lost seven percent of their body weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers did not look at the effects of GLP-1s after two years. It's unclear exactly why, but this could be because so many users quit before this mark.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ann Rogers, president of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery who was not involved in the study, said: 'While both patient groups lose weight, metabolic and bariatric surgery is much more effective and durable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Those who get insufficient weight loss with GLP-1s or have challenges complying with treatment due to side effects or costs, should consider bariatric surgery as an option or even in combination.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers speculate patients may stop weight loss shots before their prescription runs out due to not getting the results they want fast enough. Additionally, they may suffer harsh side effects like stomach paralysis and blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the second study released this week showed they may be more likely to suffer anxiety, cognitive issues or psychotic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers suspect people getting weight loss surgery may have better results than those on Ozempic because a large percentage of GLP-1 users quit using the drugs. Side effects could be to blame. Brea Hand (left), for example, told DailyMail.com she required five hospital visits before doctors diagnosed her with gastroparesis, which was allegedly caused by Ozempic. And Brad Roberts claimed in a lawsuit the drug gave him joint and muscle pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That study, from researchers at Tulane University in Louisiana, looked at 33,600 patients who had bariatric surgery and 33,600 who were perscribed GLP-1 medications for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found people who had surgery were 54 percent less likely to develop cognitive deficits like memory issues, 18 percent less likely to have anxiety and 17 percent less likely to develop substance abuse issues than people on weight loss drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's unclear exactly why bariatric surgery lowered these risks, the experts suggested it could be due to surgery causing faster, more consistent results.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Shauna Levy, study co-author and chief in the Division of MIS/Bariatric surgery at Tulane University School of Medicine, said: 'The study shows metabolic and bariatric surgery confers a strong protective effect against common mental health disorders in a head-to-head comparison with GLP-1 pharmacotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The data supports embedding psychiatric screening and support within both surgical and medical obesity programs to help reduce the potential mental health burden after treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Further investigation is needed, however, to determine why the psychological impact is so different between treatment modalities.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

GLP-1 medications often improve blood sugar levels, reduce inflammation, and enhance endothelial function,” the urologist wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These benefits can improve erectile quality, potentially making erections firmer and more noticeable, further contributing to the perception of increased size.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Dr Ambardjieva ended, though “Ozempic penis” sounds catchy, it’s not quite accurate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What men are really experiencing is a combination of anatomical unmasking and better erectile function not penile growth per se.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost UK</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 10:03:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPRm5CN0VSUWt1NHQwNWRnd0lPMGNaWEQ3NUFjSmZSM0QwT0FGZTRPOWRXbU9naUk5c196anlsX2NSVDB4b1NyNldlNjctbEthQTNodHd4LVpKSnItYlhqNExrNFBCTFRVN0N6NnBTWnVheGNlUUxyUGZkeWY1MGdVZno1T2twdXVxZXhtRy0wWWpkZ9IBmAFBVV95cUxNTjB5bjZtY0dXcUZyR0RPVnZQa2c5a0JweHhRa2tkRlVGOGRlRU04X3VIVTdCTnF1dzdtN3o3aXo4aHE5RW5zTTRla2ZBQkRKYXZXNDQzVldRckQzQVd4MGZXUnB3NE16RWxrU2NEX0wwZW1kOEpDN01WcFJjeWlJUENQbm1FYTVQMk9hSWN6VEJpNnNXSWhlSw</guid></item><item><title>太多女性在获得宫内节育器时“笑着忍受”。我帮助编写了新的疼痛管理指南来改变这种状况。-雅虎 | Too many women 'grin and bear it' when getting an IUD.

Many of them likely walked into their doctor’s office with a bit of anxiety, not knowing what exactly the procedure would feel like: Would it be just a pinch or would it be incredibly painful? (There is no shortage of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/heres-story-experienced-childbirth-contractions-062508332.html" data-ylk="slk:viral horror stories;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;viral horror stories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.)

We call them &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/long-acting-reversible-contraception-iud-and-implant" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LARCs;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;LARCs&lt;/a&gt;, or long-acting reversible contraceptives. &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/hormonal-iud-mirena" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hormonal IUDs;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Hormonal IUDs&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud/how-effective-are-iuds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:over 99% effective;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;over 99% effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing pregnancy, and &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud/non-hormonal-copper-iud" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nonhormonal IUDs;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;nonhormonal IUDs&lt;/a&gt; are equally effective. What’s nice about hormonal IUDs is that we also use them to manage a lot of gynecologic conditions, such as heavy menstrual bleeding and painful periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, patients are coming to us and saying, “I do not want to have this horrible experience with getting an IUD. How can we manage this?” I’ve been in practice for a little over 20 years, and [when I started out] we would tell people to take some ibuprofen beforehand and try to do some distraction techniques while we’re putting it in. There’s a lot of grin and bear it in gynecology and in women’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s really challenging for us as providers to give people an accurate assessment of what they’re going to experience with IUD placement. I’ve seen people who have had IUDs placed, where it was like, &lt;em&gt;That was not terrible,&lt;/em&gt; and then all the way to &lt;em&gt;That was the worst pain that I’ve ever had in my entire life and I had a natural childbirth&lt;/em&gt;. There’s a very large range of how people experience pain as well as anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So I think as a provider, the guidelines really put the onus on us to help people anticipate the pain and have that conversation about what they can expect. Sometimes they won’t know until they’re in the throes of it, and so it’s about being prepared with some pain options in anticipation that it could be a really painful and uncomfortable procedure for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="why-iud-insertion-can-be-painful"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why IUD insertion can be painful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;IUD insertion requires the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/pelvic-exams-uncomfortable-speculum-175304720.html" data-ylk="slk:placement of a speculum;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;placement of a speculum&lt;/a&gt;, which sort of holds open the vagina in a way that's not normal. So having a speculum in the vagina is not really comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then there’s the procedure itself. A lot of times, we have to manipulate the position of the uterus, and we do that sometimes by putting a clamp on the cervix. It's this sort of sharp instrument that takes a little “bite” out of the cervix to hold it in place. So that &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="link " href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/tenaculum" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tenaculum;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;tenaculum&lt;/a&gt; placement can be very painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;IUDs are placed in the uterus, which is a muscular organ. To do that, you have to go through the cervix, which is the opening to the uterus. The cervix can be very tight, especially if someone has not had a vaginal birth. And so getting through that cervical opening can be really painful for some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The uterine body itself has some nerves, so something going into the uterus is just crampy and painful — it's a very deep, visceral pain that is hard to explain to people if they've never had any kind of instrumentation in the uterus before. We also have a really large nerve called the vagus nerve that goes through the cervix; so people can also have this kind of &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/syc-20350527" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vasovagal-type response;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;vasovagal-type response&lt;/a&gt; when we manipulate the cervix, which makes people feel really terrible too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It makes you feel like you're going to pass out, and you get hot, and you feel like you're going to throw up. And sometimes people feel like they have to poop, and that is a really uncomfortable feeling as well. So there are many different aspects that cause pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But not everyone's going to feel that way. As a provider, I don't want to scare people out of getting this really effective birth control method or way to manage heavy menstrual bleeding. So [it’s about] finding that balance between giving people the information they need so they can feel, &lt;em&gt;OK, I'm going into this with my eyes open&lt;/em&gt;, but also not terrifying and scaring people away that they say, &lt;em&gt;Yeah, I'm never ever gonna do that&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I always say it's like going to a restaurant. You're going to tell 25 people when you have a terrible restaurant experience. But if you have a great restaurant experience or a mediocre restaurant experience, you don't really tell anybody. So, I think there are a lot of people who do great with their IUD insertion and really manage it well, but they're not as vocal about it as somebody who's had a really awful experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="why-the-new-pain-management-guidelines-are-important"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the new pain management guidelines are important&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What the evidence for the guidelines really demonstrated was that using some sort of topical lidocaine, which is a numbing agent, on the cervix was beneficial compared to a placebo or compared to other distracting techniques or ibuprofen and other pain medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many of us have been offering better pain management options in the last several years compared to maybe what was happening 10 or 25 years ago. We know from the evidence that anxiety tends to worsen pain. I think providers will give anxiolytics [medications to treat anxiety], so telling patients to take a little bit of Xanax or some Ativan to help with the anxiety. And I do think people are using localized lidocaine, whether that’s in a gel or a spray or putting in an injectable lidocaine through &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/paracervical-block" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a paracervical (nerve) block;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;a paracervical (nerve) block&lt;/a&gt;. I think that is becoming much more typical. There’s also IV sedation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The other big thing that comes out of these guidelines is that we as providers owe it to our patients to have a discussion about some options that are available to them. So, it’s really having the conversation, guiding patients to make the best decisions for themselves and then hopefully being able to find some interventions that you can do in your clinic safely and effectively to give people some options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I hope that these guidelines get the conversation started in a way that we’re meeting people where their needs are ... that they feel heard and can access things like IUDs that are really highly effective ... and that we believe patients when they say, “This was really painful.” Or, “I had a really terrible experience last time I did this.” [We should] trust them to know their bodies and say, “OK, here are the things we're going to do to hopefully try to improve that experience this time.” So I hope that's what comes out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Patients need to feel like they're in a space where they can advocate for themselves and be heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 10:00:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-wFBVV95cUxNUUxhcGZnOHpNRE5GVzc0aF90VERLVXVONUFTRjNtTkZudUM5M2lKc1EwNGtVb0dGbUxYeUN1U05mUklNbHlDRjY0OEpKQjZPcDhfQl83MS03Vm0tUTNqb01reHh4andKR2hPZVMtajljT3hDSTI4SjJFQ3ZIOXVMUTlWamp1X0dnWGo0WmJ2N3g2dEZyVkZFYVJkaUJsdlUwY0FOeFFYRzNRYjZGSF9TQ0xNWkpQTkFJNmMwTnRDNnBDeEQzbjd0RDBCbU41TEFBVGx0Y1E3ZEhsQ1ZWbXBDREJjeVVvMVNCdGRzQWlQdmNxMnhnZUVSazczTQ</guid></item><item><title>我买了雪人的保温碗，现在每个午餐休息时间都是野餐-汤姆的指南 | I bought YETI's insulated bowls, and now every lunch break is a picnic - Tom's Guide</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOTHM3ZWFxOWZDWG1Gamg3N3ZMMENUWUJ3UVFTMmp4YmZ2VzZ0X3JIUUFZeTIzcVY4VkFQSUFwTUs1RzJTemN5Z1ZqbmQ4RDBfU29yRDhoTUVYdnFoNjZVX01ISks0SXo1QXZxblp4eUozMHU4dTZVZkpUXzJMYTBSRHZYV0dHbVQyUzB6WVlSeVJiSEVCSC1GbXpPSThkaEdEMHVqeXJrUFFFMTFa?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're halfway through the year, and my New Year's resolution? It's not going well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, I resolved to go for a long walk every day. I live in London, and I'm not sure if you've heard, but it rains a lot here. Plus, once I'm locked into work mode, it can be tough to tear myself away from my comfy desk setup and lace up my sneakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now the weather's turning, my resolution is looking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently invested in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://yetius.pxf.io/c/221109/1026334/13394?subId1=tomsguide-us-6006782108231112090&amp;amp;sharedId=tomsguide-us&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yeti.com%2Fcollections%2Fcollections-featured%2Fgift-sets%2Fthree-course-bundle-US.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener" data-url="https://www.yeti.com/collections/collections-featured/gift-sets/three-course-bundle-US.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://yetius.pxf.io/c/221109/1026334/13394?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;sharedId=hawk-prefix&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yeti.com%2Fcollections%2Fcollections-featured%2Fgift-sets%2Fthree-course-bundle-US.html" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="YETI US" data-merchant-id="206105" data-merchant-network="ImpactRad" data-merchant-url="yeti.com"&gt;YETI's Rambler Insulated Bowls&lt;/a&gt;, and they're turning my lunch breaks into a daily picnic. I've got some lovely green spaces near me, and the one thing that can reliably tear me away from my desk is a clear blue sky and a crisp summer salad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's why YETI's Rambler Bowls are my al fresco buy of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-so-long-desk-lunches"&gt;&lt;span&gt;So long, desk lunches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Tom's Guide)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm a chronic desk luncher, but YETI's new Rambler Bowls are luring me out into the great outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Durable, well-insulated, and aesthetically pleasing, this trio is getting me through salad season in style. And since I made the splurge, I've been packing my iced coffee and salad to go, and treating myself to a lunchtime picnic in the local park on my work-from-home days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-SD3TNrNHn67wWTxTAc5Tki" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-SD3TNrNHn67wWTxTAc5Tki slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Tom's Guide)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The set comes in three sizes and features a nesting design for easy storage. My go-to is the 2-quart bowl, which is an ideal size for a big midweek salad, but the 4.5-quart bowl would be ideal for serving a crowd or taking to BBQs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A word of warning, though, while the lids fit snugly and securely into the stainless steel bowls, they do have a small hole, which means they're not leak-proof. I've been packing my salad dressing separately to avoid any spills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, it prevents a soggy salad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Growing up, Natalie Bushaw was always active. In high school, she played basketball, ran track, and became a cheerleader to ride the bus with her then boyfriend, now husband. By college, she got into &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/teenage-sons-strength-training-terrified-mom-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;weightlifting&lt;/a&gt;, reaching 155 pounds and breaking the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/fitness/how-to-bench-press" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;bench press&lt;/a&gt; record on display at the school gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, life got complicated. In 2003, Bushaw gave birth to twin boys who had health challenges and, between them, required more than 30 procedures and surgeries throughout the years. Once her sons were in preschool, Bushaw wanted to start &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-trainer-mom-older-strength-training-habit-five-years-longevity-2024-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;exercising more regularly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was just, 'Figure out who you are, Natalie, get back to the Natalie you remember who enjoyed working out, who wanted to be healthy and fit and strong and just do it,'" Bushaw, 51, told Business Insider. That year, she joined a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/life-time-ceo-bahram-akradi-50-supplements-healthy-aging-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Life Time gym&lt;/a&gt; near her home in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Bushaw has gotten a job with the gym, becoming the vice president of public relations and corporate communications for&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the brand. Now, she&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;goes to the gym six times a week.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Getting into shape also got easier once Bushaw found the right treatment for her &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/42-year-old-woman-lost-60-pounds-easy-habits-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;perimenopause symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/does-gigi-hadid-have-hashimotos-disease-what-is-it-2016-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Hashimoto's thyroiditis&lt;/a&gt;, an autoimmune disease that causes the immune system to attack the thyroid gland and can lead to weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bushaw said that by staying consistent with her medications and finding the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fitness-power-couple-daily-routine-stay-fit-at-any-age-2023-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;right workouts&lt;/a&gt;, she feels "sharper and metabolically the healthiest I've ever been."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="8baf163f-15a6-43a2-9983-42cd094bfd58" data-toc-id="8baf163f-15a6-43a2-9983-42cd094bfd58"&gt;Less cardio, more strength training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Bushaw felt the most efficient workouts were the most demanding ones. "I wanted to get hot and sweaty and be exhausted," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after she joined Life Time, she got a personal trainer who had her do an active metabolic assessment to measure how much oxygen she was&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;taking in and how much carbon dioxide she was breathing out while exercising at various intensities. Bushaw wore a fitness assessment mask as she ran on a treadmill and learned her &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/good-resting-heart-rate-how-to-know-improve-longevity-fitness-2024-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vo2-max-explained-what-is-good-how-improve-2024-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt;, a heart measurement that can be used to gauge longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The test also taught her whether she was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lose-fat-build-muscle-simple-steps-body-recomposition-personal-trainer-2022-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;losing fat&lt;/a&gt; or carbohydrates during different exercises.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Some people are "&lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.ironman.com/news/do-you-burn-sugar-or-fat" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;sugar burners&lt;/a&gt;," burning more carbohydrates than fat during workouts. Knowing which one you are can help you modify your diet and workouts to better hit your goals, such as weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bushaw learned that she was primarily burning carbohydrates during &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/study-hiit-short-workouts-boost-fitness-longevity-stroke-survival-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;high-intensity workouts&lt;/a&gt;.

She said she noticed gradual weight loss over the year, which helped her "muscles shine through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a mind shift because you do not burn as many calories with less intensity," she said. "The focus isn't the number of calories; it's the type of calories. I needed to burn more fat calories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, she usually starts her gym sessions with 20 to 30 minutes of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/fitness/types-of-cardio" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cardio&lt;/a&gt; (using the treadmill, StairMaster, elliptical, or rower). Then, she moves on to a few strength exercises for one to two body parts that day, using both barbells and 15- to 45-pound dumbbells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="87510a2c-2449-48bf-bc01-95f81acf1db4" data-toc-id="87510a2c-2449-48bf-bc01-95f81acf1db4"&gt;She keeps challenging herself&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Bushaw said she "&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/progressive-overload-fitness-meaning-and-how-to-do-it-2021-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;progressively overloads&lt;/a&gt;" — a term for gradually increasing the intensity of her workouts over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's really, really important that we don't get stuck always doing the same thing or lifting the same weight because the change isn't going to happen then," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About every six weeks, she'll increase what she's lifting by 2 to 5 pounds, depending on the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also sometimes takes &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/fitness/barre-workout" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;barre classes&lt;/a&gt; to switch up which muscle groups she works out. Even though barre typically uses far lighter weights than she's used to, they feel "way heavier because you're just using your muscles in different ways," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get more cardio throughout the day — rather than just in one 5,000-step morning workout — she bought a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/fitness/best-under-desk-treadmills" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;walking pad&lt;/a&gt; for her office last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I easily started hitting 10 to 12,000 steps and felt so much better, mind, body, and soul," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="e828a3a5-6075-4eb9-a6b3-4293ed942397" data-toc-id="e828a3a5-6075-4eb9-a6b3-4293ed942397"&gt;She doesn't overthink&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When Bushaw first started working out again after having her twins, she had to adhere to a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/morning-routine-tips-from-teacher-and-mom-of-4-2024-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;strict morning schedule&lt;/a&gt; as a working mom. She would work out from 5:23 a.m. to 6:26 a.m. every day so she could return home and get out the door before 7:30 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, though, she wouldn't get to bed in time to get a full night of rest. Instead of worrying about her &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/early-morning-workouts-healthy-get-enough-sleep-2023-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt; and talking herself out of a workout, Bushaw "would just pretend that I didn't know how to tell time," she said. If she was going to bed at 11:30 p.m., she'd mentally act like she was going to bed at 10:30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I faked myself out, but it worked," she said. It helped her avoid the slippery slope of missing gym sessions when plans didn't align perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bushaw said the key is not overthinking her workouts, such as worrying about how they fit into her children's lives or work tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you overthink all of the things, you're going to get yourself stuck," she said. "If you just make a commitment, like, 'This is what I do, this is a part of my routine,' you can get through things a lot easier."&lt;/p&gt;

When you break down and metabolise proteins, one of the byproducts is toxins to drive inflammation and cause bowel cancer," he told LADbible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"And the thing that is really bad for your gut are all of these high protein powders, like these creatine powders, they profoundly change your microbiome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Microbiome refers to gut microorganisms that influence colon cancer risk by affecting inflammation, immune response, and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The doctor said 'protein powders are bad news' (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Over-processed foods with additives and preservatives, such as instant noodles, sugary cereals, and packaged snacks may increase colon cancer risk by promoting inflammation and harmful gut microbiome changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But instead of consuming protein powders, Dr Kinross suggests to 'aim for plant-based proteins [over] animal based proteins'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"And actually, you know, just completely avoid powdered fibres and those kind of nutrition counters, they're terrible for your gut," the King Edward VII’s Hospital Consultant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The link to red meat and bowel cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Red meat is normally packed with a lot of protein (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Red meat is considered to be a great source of protein, but Dr Kinross warns that if you're going to have it, it should only be as a treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"If you're going to have red meat, you want to have high quality red meat. And it should be a once a week thing. It's a treat," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;On its particular dangers, the surgeon explains that 'red meat has a particular amino acid that's broken down by the body in the liver, and that causes some of the harmful effects. There's a particular metabolite which we think causes the harm'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What should you eat instead of red meat?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The doctor says you don't need to go full vegan (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Although Dr Kinross has suggested to lessen your red meat consumption, he said that being a full vegan isn't necessary either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"If you can just replace one portion of red meat with some white fish or chicken, you will significantly reduce your risk of bowel cancer," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"You don't need to be vegan to have a healthy gut. That's definitely not true, but what you shouldn't be doing is having meat with every single meal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The 'three pillars' of bowel cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Consultant colorectal surgeon Dr James Kinross has issued a bowel cancer warning to people who consume a diet high in protein (X/@bowelsurgeon)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;So, ultra processed food is only part of the problem, as Dr Kinross says there are three things that ultimately cause colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Genes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The genes that you're born with... We're getting much better at detecting inheritable cancers and the minority of bowel cancers are heritable, probably about 5 percent or less that are genetically determined," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Environment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Things you eat, environmental contaminants that you come into contact with that we know drive cancer risk," the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As well as ultra processed foods, you've got micro plastics and 'various toxins you might come into contact with in your environment'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Ultra processed foods are cheaper, affordable, and sustain large numbers of the population who are deprived. The fault is with companies that egregiously market these foods to young people and children and profit handsomely," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Microbes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As explained above, very specific microbes in your gut are very strongly associated with bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"But we also think it's not just about having too many of the wrong bacteria. It's about not having enough of the good bacteria," Dr Kinross noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to prevent bowel cancer with early screening&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Bowel cancer can be prevented (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"If you catch bowel cancer early, you know you can completely cure it," he insists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The moment we call people to colonoscopy, in Scotland it's 50, I think in England it's 64, but it's about to come down to 50, whereas in practice, the disease is changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"If you're worried, go see your doctor.

It was during a difficult divorce, involving her two young teenagers, while she was still in the throes of a long-term depression. "It was just a really, really stressful time," recalls Russell, a teacher and librarian at an elementary school in Connecticut, US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But then on the internet she came across something called "creative bibliotherapy", where a tailored recommendation of fiction is offered with the aim of improving mental health. The name Ella Berthoud, a bibliotherapist based in Sussex, UK, who co-wrote the book &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17707738-the-novel-cure" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;The Novel Cure&lt;/a&gt; about such literary remedies, kept popping up.

"I just was blown away," Russell recalls. Learning from the lessons and mistakes of fictional characters helped her process what she was going through and made her feel less alone.

Considering the shortage of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.bma.org.uk/what-we-do/population-health/supporting-peoples-mental-health/failing-mental-healthcare-system" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;affordable mental health services&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2023/751416/EPRS_BRI(2023)751416_EN.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;many countries&lt;/a&gt;, the idea that fiction can offer support is appealing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As anyone who has ever read and loved a work of drama, poetry or fiction can attest, stories have powerful effects on our minds and emotions. But that doesn't mean that any kind of fiction boosts mental health for everyone. Several experts interviewed for this article worry about what they see as an overhyped promise of creative bibliotherapy in treating specific mental health conditions, where they say the scientific evidence is still rather thin. In fact, research suggests that certain books &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-018-0191-5" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;can even be harmful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Rather, the existing research paints a more nuanced picture, suggesting that fiction &lt;i id="can" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; help boost general wellbeing, but it depends a lot on the person, the book and how they engage with it, says James Carney, a computational cognitive scientist at the London Interdisciplinary School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There's this idea that books are this cultic object that are going to make everything better," Carney says. "I think for a certain number of conditions and for a certain type of personality, it can be the case, but the idea that they're a universal medicine is just simply false."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ljm8yg.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images/ BBC Some people report great advantages from reading fiction to help with major life events (Credit: Getty Images/ BBC)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images/ BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Some people report great advantages from reading fiction to help with major life events (Credit: Getty Images/ BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some trace the origins of bibliotherapy to World War One, when fiction and non-fiction books were used to ease soldiers' suffering and trauma. But the idea made a return in the 1990s, Carney says. Today it takes many forms – from bibliotherapists like Berthoud who offer tailored recommendations for &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ellaberthoud.com/christmas-bibliotherapy" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;£100 ($130) per session&lt;/a&gt;, to some GPs who point some of their patients to fiction, like Andrew Schuman. He's an NHS physician who advises the bibliotherapy charity &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.relitfoundation.org/about" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;ReLit&lt;/a&gt; and co-wrote the 2016 Lancet paper about the benefits of bibliotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While fiction bibliotherapy isn't a substitute for other treatments, "in conjunction with other therapies, it can be a massively powerful, boosting therapy", Schuman says. A benefit compared with other therapy types, Russell adds, is that people can do it on their own time, approaching their books when they feel emotionally ready and putting them down if they're overwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Since 2013, the UK non-profit The Reading Agency's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://readingagency.org.uk/get-reading/our-programmes-and-campaigns/reading-well/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Reading Well&lt;/a&gt; programme has been curating book lists for people with conditions like dementia or depression. These lists are hand-picked and reviewed by experts and people with lived experiences of those conditions, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://readingagency.org.uk/about-us/our-people/staff/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;says Gemma Jolly&lt;/a&gt;, the organisation's head of health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Jolly says the goal is to guide people to genuinely helpful titles, especially given the overwhelming number of books about mental health and what she perceives as widespread snobbery around what qualifies as "good" literature. By partnering with local libraries in England and Wales, the programme has facilitated loans of over 3.9 million books since its inception, she says. Even some UK health agencies have taken note of bibliotherapy: in certain cases, such as eating disorders, self-help books are recognised as a therapeutic tool in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK49304/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;clinical guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. It's worth noting that, like fiction recommendations, not all self-help books tailored to a condition or life stage are going to be beneficial and effective for all patients – and you should consult your GP if you have specific health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Yet the evidence that reading helps mental health is complicated. Scientists have observed that, compared with non-readers, people who read regularly for pleasure tend to be less stressed, depressed &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40034518" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;and lonely&lt;/a&gt;, more socially connected and confident, and&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5105607/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt; perhaps even live longer&lt;/a&gt;, as the psychological scientist Giulia Poerio of the University of Sussex in the UK &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.redalyc.org/journal/1798/179862340004/html/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;summarised&lt;/a&gt; in a 2020 article. But, Poerio asks, "is it actually that reading fiction is improving wellbeing, or is it just the case that people with better wellbeing tend to be people who read fiction?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For many self-help books – which some experts &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5902994/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;describe&lt;/a&gt; as essentially self-guided therapy – the benefits are clear, Poerio says. One &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15554567/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;2004 study&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, found that self-help books can help people with anxiety and depression, while a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004191.pub2/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;2006 study&lt;/a&gt; on patients with eating disorders found that self-help was similarly effective as other psychological therapies in reducing binging, purging and symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the evidence is shaky when it comes to treating specific mental health conditions. Some &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0300443840160304" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;experts have theorised&lt;/a&gt; that reading about characters with our own lived experiences &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.2161-1939.2010.tb00087.x" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;allows us to identify with them&lt;/a&gt; and experience a cathartic moment when the characters overcome challenges, which we can then emulate in our own lives, explains Emily Troscianko, a literary scientist at the University of Oxford. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But there is little research on whether this actually happens, she says. In her view, "I think [it's] so simplistic and clearly not what's happening a lot of the time when people are reading about difficult experiences that have some similarity to their own," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ljm94g.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images/ BBC For some health conditions, reading fiction tailored to that condition can cause harm rather than help (Credit: Getty Images/ BBC)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images/ BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;For some health conditions, reading fiction tailored to that condition can cause harm rather than help (Credit: Getty Images/ BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Anecdotally, many people say they feel that fiction has helped with their mental states; 81% of people who took part in The Reading Agency's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://tra-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/entries/document/6637/RW_Infographic_MAIN_2020-2022.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;2022 annual survey&lt;/a&gt; said their Reading Well book helped them better understand their health needs.

The existing research doesn't meet that standard, he says. In the case of post-traumatic stress disorder, for instance – a condition where some &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08893675.2017.1266190" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt; believe that fictional worlds could be especially useful in allowing patients to process emotions that may otherwise feel threatening – &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08893675.2017.1266190" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;one 2017 review&lt;/a&gt; concluded that there weren't any high-quality studies to prove beneficial effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Literature is complicated.

In a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-018-0191-5" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt;, Troskianko collaborated with the UK &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/get-information-and-support/about-eating-disorders/types/anorexia/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;eating disorder charity Beat&lt;/a&gt; to survey almost 900 people, most of whom had experienced an eating disorder. They were asked how reading fiction books had affected their mood, self-esteem, diets and exercise habits and how they felt about their bodies. Surprisingly to Troscianko, when people recalled reading books featuring characters with eating disorders, it tended to worsen their symptoms. "If you've got an eating disorder, you're likely to at least perceive that the effects of reading that stuff for yourself were negative," she says. Worryingly, about a dozen participants said they even actively sought out such books, she adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Troscianko speculates that these books trigger the same ill feelings that drive eating disorders, such as competitiveness around each other's bodies and eating habits. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39135111/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Other research&lt;/a&gt; she's done suggests that people with eating disorders struggle to focus on texts that are not relevant to their condition. Ultimately, "the only stuff that you can focus on is actually just drawing you further into that obsessive world of narrow obsessions," she says. "This is one reason why I get frustrated with the quite blithe attitude of, 'reading books about stuff must always be helpful' because, well, it just depends on the books. Literature is complicated. Human beings are complicated, and so why wouldn't you expect the effects also to be complex and nuanced?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Carney suspects that people with addiction may be similarly triggered by novels featuring characters with substance abuse habits, which often tend to glamorise addiction, Carney says. Meanwhile, Schuman, the NHS doctor, stresses that he only discusses fiction with patients he knows well, and that he'd never recommend it for people in the grip of a psychotic illness or who are having suicidal thoughts – which he says could be harmful but also inappropriate and unhelpful, possibly undermining patients' trust in doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Reading Well programme is mindful of these kinds of nuances, Jolly says. For example, in light of the research that fictionalised accounts of certain conditions could be detrimental, The Reading Agency developed a list of generally &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://uk.bookshop.org/lists/mood-boosting-books" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;mood-boosting, uplifting books&lt;/a&gt; for people who want to escape from any condition or experience they’re going through. The Reading Well recommendations for adults with eating disorders only include books that offer practical support and not fictionalised accounts relating to eating habits and body image (although the reading lists for teens do include such books, based on feedback from health professionals and young people who wanted more personal stories, Jolly says). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Reading Well programme has also removed fictionalised stories about dementia after feedback from patients who said they prefer real-world accounts that better capture the nuances of the condition. Jolly acknowledges that books aren't the solution for everyone. "We always say it's not a one size fits all," she says.

He suggests that reading fiction featuring predictable character types – like a lot of 19th-Century, Sherlock-Holmes-type stories – could be helpful, "because you're essentially flooding the world with evidence that the world is predictable".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Outside the context of treating specific conditions, reading fiction, drama or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ebbbb948bf7835fcbe67b02/t/5ebec4d0fffacc230dcfde9d/1589560532297/MindfulPoetryTrial.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; could help boost general mental wellbeing. For instance, people with chronic pain who &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17533015.2014.957330" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;took part&lt;/a&gt; in a reading-aloud programme hosted by the UK charity The Reader Organisation reported they felt a sense of shared community, improvements in mood and quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Such wellbeing boosts may depend on how people engage with books. In &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.redalyc.org/journal/1798/179862340004/html/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;one of Poerio's studies&lt;/a&gt;, she and her colleagues had 94 senior-aged people listen to audiobooks that they had selected from a list of popular fiction and non-fiction books. Remarkably, even two weeks after the programme, participants reported an improvement in their wellbeing and felt their lives to be more meaningful – but only those people who said they had engaged deeply with, and appreciated, their book. "When people were emotionally engaged with the content of the book – it was transporting them, they were feeling absorbed, it resonated with them, it had a lasting impression on them – that's where we saw benefits to wellbeing," Poerio says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Carney agrees that merely giving people a novel won't have much effect; &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8993009/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;his research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that reflecting on books afterwards – especially together with other people – provides a much bigger wellbeing boost. Discussing literature gives people a way to think about distressing things that doesn't impinge on their wellbeing, Carney says. "When you're reading fiction, you're not bothered by Heathcliff or what Heathcliff's going to do, because Heathcliff is insulated from you by the fact that he's not real. Fiction gives you a way to rehearse all these difficult, challenging social scenarios," Carney says. And "if you can do that with other people, it makes it more real, it makes it more impactful". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For people wanting to try out bibliotherapy for themselves, Carney recommends trying to find a club for group discussions. Jolly recommends public libraries, where you can try lots of books for free – and if a book isn't resonating with you, pick up another one instead, try something shorter, or a different genre like poetry. And if reading isn't for you, Poerio adds, maybe there are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32567876/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;other ways to improve wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;, like music or visual art. "If you feel it's helping you, if you're feeling the benefit… you'll want to carry on," Schuman says. "But if it feels unhelpful or intrusive, then [you] should feel completely at liberty to stop at any point." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As for Russell, she's convinced that bibliotherapy offers a path to better mental health and has done a session with Berthoud several times since her first appointment. She's even bought her friends bibliotherapy vouchers, and is using it to help her students, too, selecting books that discuss immigrant experiences, themes of loss, or other hardships. "I think the biggest point of it is so you don't feel so alone," she says. "You can take a deep breath and say, I'm not on this journey by myself." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="*-all-content-within-this-column-is-provided-for-general-information-only-and-should-not-be-treated-as-a-substitute-for-the-medical-advice-of-your-own-doctor-or-any-other-health-care-professional.-the-bbc-is-not-responsible-or-liable-for-any-diagnosis-made-by-a-user-based-on-the-content-of-this-site.-the-bbc-is-not-liable-for-the-contents-of-any-external-internet-sites-listed,-nor-does-it-endorse-any-commercial-product-or-service-mentioned-or-advised-on-any-of-the-sites.-always-consult-your-own-gp-if-you're-in-any-way-concerned-about-your-health." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;* All content within this column is provided for general information only and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

A wedding, your child’s birth, or maybe just a perfect night out with friends. Sit with it for a moment. Remember the details. What were you wearing? What did it &lt;a href="https://nationalgeographic.com/health/article/sensory-memory" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:smell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;smell&lt;/a&gt; like? How did it make you feel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now do the opposite. Think of a &lt;i&gt;sad &lt;/i&gt;memory—the loss of a loved one, getting laid off, or a painful breakup. Sit with this one too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Which would you rather keep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Of course, you want the happy memory, the one that made you feel good and joyful about life. Yet, the painful ones linger for years and sometimes decades, like bruises beneath the surface. If you could choose, would you keep them—or delete them entirely?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If this is all starting to sound like something out of &lt;i&gt;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;Inception, &lt;/i&gt;you wouldn’t be too far off—and Steve Ramirez would agree with you. Ramirez is a neuroscientist at Boston University and &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/impact/explorers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Geographic Explorer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Geographic Explorer&lt;/a&gt; whose research occurs on the bleeding edge of &lt;a href="https://nationalgeographic.com/health/article/memory-psychology-neuroscience" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:memory science;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;memory science&lt;/a&gt;. He’s perhaps best known for studies he helped conduct that showed that it was possible to implant a false memory in mice. The findings were published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23888038/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2013;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt; and the Royal Society in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24298144/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2014;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;His research is built on a central truth: Memory is fickle. It changes and morphs every time we recall it. Ramirez compares it to hitting “Save As” on a Word document. Everytime we retrieve a &lt;a href="https://nationalgeographic.com/health/article/mind-diet-memory-benefits" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:memory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, we change it slightly. Ramirez is exploring whether we can harness that “Save As” process—intentionally rewriting our memories instead of letting them change by accident. So far, he’s figured out how to do something even more surprising: not destroy a bad memory, but create a new one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The science of remembering what never happened&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We know memories are malleable, and susceptible to modification,” says Ramirez. “Every time they're recalled, they're being saved and edited with bits and pieces. We wanted to see if we could do that in the lab. Because if we could do that directly in the lab and brain, then we can really get a higher resolution snapshot of how memories work when they're being warped or when they're being modified.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The team’s foundational study came in a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22441246/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2012;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; paper published in &lt;i&gt;Nature &lt;/i&gt;where they identified and activated a cluster of neurons in mice brains that encoded a fear memory—specifically, a mild foot shock. To do so, the researchers genetically engineered the mice so that &lt;a href="https://nationalgeographic.com/health/article/memory-choir-auditory-dementia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:memory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;-related neurons become light sensitive. The creatures were then placed into a box and received a foot shock—resulting in the memory of that shock becoming encoded in the light-sensitive brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The team then surgically implanted a tiny fiber-optic cable into the skull of each mouse that they could use to shine a laser into its brain. When they turned it on, it activated the bad memory on command like flipping a switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Next they wanted to see if they could create a &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/151113-ramirez-memory-mice-erase-ptsd-science0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:false memory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;false memory&lt;/a&gt;. For this, they put a mouse in a safe box and let it explore. The next day, they placed the mouse in a different box, triggered the &lt;a href="https://nationalgeographic.com/health/article/amnesia-artificial-memory-joshua-foer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:memory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; of the safe box by shooting a laser over its brain, and simultaneously gave it a foot shock&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;When they later returned the mouse in the first box, it froze in fear—even though it never received a shock in that box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The team had, in effect, implanted a false memory in the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The key thing with that experiment was that we showed that we could artificially activate a memory while the animal was experiencing something. Later, that new, updated version was the animal's last recorded version of that &lt;a href="https://nationalgeographic.com/health/article/memory-palace-technique" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:memory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;,” he explains. “The mouse was scared in an environment where, technically, nothing bad happened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Inside the brain’s editing room&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Between the lasers, false memories, and shocking experiments, you’d be forgiven if you thought this was getting pretty sci-fi. Ramirez embraces the comparison as his work often brushes up against science fiction in big ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I think science fiction and science reality are in lockstep, often influencing each other in surprising and unpredictable ways,” Ramirez says. “What sci-fi can get ‘wrong’ sometimes is inevitable, but the work it inspires and the dreams and visions sci-fi can conjure up in people is practically limitless, and I love it for that very reason.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, it can seem scary, especially when you consider the potential applications to humans. But Ramirez says that memory manipulation would take a decidedly less invasive approach for people—no brain lasers required. Instead, if you want to activate a happy memory in another person, all you have to do is ask them about it. (Remember the beginning of the story—or did you &lt;a href="https://nationalgeographic.com/health/article/active-forgetting" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:forget;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;forget&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We can update a seemingly safe memory into something negative,” he says, referring to the foot shock test. “But what about the opposite: Can we turn a negative memory into a positive &lt;a href="https://nationalgeographic.com/health/article/digital-smartphone-cameras-memory" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:memory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite the pop-culture comparisons to &lt;i&gt;Inception&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Eternal Sunshine&lt;/i&gt;, Ramirez’s real-world applications are far less cinematic—and arguably more profound. Instead, his work is laying the groundwork for helping people with PTSD process harmful memories, or those with neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and &lt;span&gt;dementia&lt;/span&gt; live longer, better lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a forthcoming paper currently under peer review, his team claims they were able to identify where exactly a &lt;a href="https://nationalgeographic.com/science/graphics/what-makes-a-photo-memorable-resmem" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:memory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; will form in the brain &lt;i&gt;days before it even happens. &lt;/i&gt;It’s like being able to predict where lightning is about to strike before the storm even gathers. This might allow future clinicians to anticipate the effects of &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/alzheimers-blood-test" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer's;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, Parkinson’s, and &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/rising-dementia-rates-reason-and-how-to-reduce-risk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; before they occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Imagine being able to make a Google Maps for memory, but with the level of individual brain cells,” he says. “You could say, ‘This is a positive memory in the brain. It's located here in this 3D web of activity. We can zoom into it here and it looks like something is misfiring, and that might be the remnants of some kind of cognitive decline or memory loss, or amnesia, or Alzheimer's.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We’re still a long way away from a Google Maps for memory. However, Ramirez is quick to point out that his field of research is still in its infancy. He puts it this way: the study of neuroscience is roughly 100 years old—whereas physics is more than 2,000 years old. “Relative to physics, neuroscience is still in its Pythagorean Theorem stage,” he jokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There’s still a lot we don’t know about the brain and, as a result, how memory works. But Ramirez and neuroscientists like him are turning science fiction into science reality, which may allow us to one day edit and manipulate our own experiences. More importantly, their research helps us understand the profound ways that memory shapes us—and how we might begin to shape it right back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article is part of &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/health/graphics/your-memory-rewired" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Your Memory, Rewired;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Memory, Rewired&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, a National Geographic exploration into the fuzzy, fascinating frontiers of memory science—including advice on how to make your own memory more powerful. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/health/graphics/your-memory-rewired" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Learn more.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learn more.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The nonprofit National Geographic Society, committed to illuminating and protecting the wonder of our world, funded National Geographic Explorer Steve Ramirez’s work. &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/impact" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Learn more;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt; about the Society’s support of Explorers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOYnhYVEZBM2lQOC1fdUNDa0xtUlJpZ3Z0ck50OW5DTEFsbDNsa2RKNGN6TlRIUWJXN003QWtmLWNzdm8wR1FUcmtjbjFUNDQ3MzdwaEt2OXlWVVJic1BUQmZ5cXBfd2FvVy1TaV93dlhTc0hxWEkwTWVEQWRvaF9MSDRQNnB5ZGk3eVZ1T1hxOA</guid></item><item><title>农药滋生是下一次大流行吗？专家警告真菌超级细菌- SciTechDaily | Are Pesticides Breeding the Next Pandemic?

Because the disease is rare in men, there were no clinical trials available for me. The emotions were overwhelming, but in those dark moments, my oncologist, Saundra Buys of the University of Utah, offered critical insight. She said the field needed to focus on “using the medicines we have in better ways.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This key piece of advice started me on a new path. I worked with a group of pioneering scientists — Bob Gatenby, Joel Brown, Sandy Anderson, Dawn Lemanne, and Carlo Maley — to adapt my cancer care to incorporate principles that farmers use to stave off pests. Six-and-a-half years later, I’m still alive. The disease has grown in me, just not in the ways you might imagine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of research and investments of billions of dollars, an advanced metastatic cancer diagnosis remains &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45307-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;almost universally fatal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The reason this disease continues to kill is summed up in one word: evolution. A treatment works initially, but cancer cells nearly always evolve resistance until the drug stops working.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This problem is similar to one commonly found on farms. When agricultural pests are bombarded with high doses of pesticides over long periods of time, the invasive bugs evolve and become resistant. To overcome this hurdle, farmers have developed resistance management plans, and many have proven to be effective. These include minimizing pesticide use, rotating pesticides from different chemical classes, and applying chemicals only as needed based on continuous monitoring of pest populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My colleagues had taken note of the parallels between cancer and farm pests. Then they incorporated some of the same ideas into mathematical models of cancer. Now, these algorithms can inform step-by-step procedures for using drugs at the right time, order, and dose to reduce the risk of the cancer evolving resistance to a treatment, while still safely controlling the disease.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Using the algorithms sidesteps flaws of mainstream oncology’s approach where therapies end up rewarding the resistant cancer cells. Standard practices also eliminate treatment-sensitive cancer cells that interfere with the growth of those that are resistant to treatment. Ironically, for similar reasons, the continuous application of pesticides at maximum doses is forbidden by U.S. law.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a scientist, I worked with my colleagues and my oncologist to develop my own management plan. Instead of waiting for my cancer to become resistant to a particular treatment before switching to the next drug, we are using approved cancer drugs in much smarter ways. My plan involves rotating 15 drugs from different chemical classes, using non-drug-based approaches to minimize drug use, and constantly monitoring the disease to adapt treatment. So far, it is working. I have outlived my original prognosis, but we don’t know if this is due to my treatment strategy. It might have happened without it. Our approach needs to be properly tested in a clinical trial, and that costs millions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The approach and the costs of these trials create a problem. You can’t patent simple rules of thumb for resistance management, so there’s no financial incentive for pharma to fund such trials. To incentivize clinical trials, the biomedical field could take cues from the tech industry. Instead of drug patents, pharma could profit from proprietary data and trade-secret algorithms. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration would need to adapt its framework as well to embrace AI agents that autonomously interact with patients and providers, and A.I.-driven decision tools that dynamically adapt treatments to the patient’s needs based on continuous data inputs. Prior to the new Republican administration, I had multiple meetings with FDA officials, and they were excited about this future. They were working with Congress to adapt and clarify regulatory frameworks for rapidly changing AI technologies. The possibilities for optimizing personalized care are extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, FDA layoffs and grant cuts by the National Institutes of Health have put the system into a terrifying downward spiral. This is happening at a moment when we have these new cost-effective solutions to transform some lethal cancers into chronically manageable diseases — as we did for diabetes and HIV/AIDS — using medicines already available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developing “algorithms-as-drugs” technologies that use the medicines we already have is an essential new complement to the existing pharma system. It offers the potential for a revolution in cancer care. We need improved algorithms to optimize treatment selection, sequencing, and timing, and deep-learning algorithms that analyze varieties of data to tell doctors when and how to change treatment to prevent drug resistance in a specific patient. The initial algorithms are &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/76284" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ready and waiting&lt;/a&gt;. The first small step is to support clinical trials. I took a chance on them and I’m not dead yet. Through startup companies (Storyline Health Inc. and Primordial AI Inc.), outreach (the Uncharted Cancer Masterclass), and basic research efforts, I am doing everything I can to help my pioneering colleagues bring these solutions to other patients quickly. They need more help.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One in seven of us will &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-deaths-by-cause" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;die from cancer&lt;/a&gt;. One in five of us will &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/global-cancer-facts-and-figures/global-cancer-facts-and-figures-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;develop cancer in our lifetime&lt;/a&gt;. New drugs cost too much, and many don’t &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-cancer-treatment-costs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;meaningfully&lt;/a&gt; extend &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2827241" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;. It’s time to embrace a new approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christopher Gregg, Ph.D., is a professor of neurobiology and human genetics at the University of Utah. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;He has financial conflicts of interest in Storyline Health Inc., Primordial AI Inc., DepoIQ Inc., and Rubicon AI Inc. and leads the free online &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://unchartedhealth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted Cancer Patient Masterclass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to share knowledge from this field.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five minutes of exercise doesn’t sound like a lot, but according to new research, if you choose the right kind of exercise, you can boost your brain health, especially in adults over 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/54/4/afaf072/8106300?login=false" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/54/4/afaf072/8106300?login=false" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Age and Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that, rather than long exercise sessions, short bursts that raise your heart rate can help enhance cognitive performance. One exercise in particular was found to be most effective: brisk walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from 585 adults between the ages of 65 and 80, all of whom participated in the longitudinal IGNITE trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists examined the participants’ sleep habits, physical activity levels, and sedentary behavior over 24 hours and compared this with their cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that people who did more physical activity had better brain health, and that a less active lifestyle could be linked to a decline in cognitive functions. Yet when they looked into the data further, they found that doing just five minutes of exercise that raised participants' heart rates, such as a brisk walk, swimming, or jogging, was linked to better cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When participants completed more moderate-to-vigorous exercise, they had better processing speed (how fast your brain thinks), executive function (how well you focus and multitask,) and working memory (your ability to store information for short periods).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the results of the study, “moving from one minute of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day to [around] six minutes per day had the largest predicted differences in the domains of executive function/attentional control, processing speed, and working memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-SxF4w5SL9mPrsjXzMMY8n4" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-SxF4w5SL9mPrsjXzMMY8n4 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any time you raise your heart rate, you increase the rate of blood flow to the brain in the body. Exercise and movement are proven to be good for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-brisk-walking-3"&gt;What are the benefits of brisk walking? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we talk about brisk walking, we mean walking at a speed that raises your heart rate. You should be breathing heavier, but you should be able to maintain the pace for the entire five minutes. You could always mix this brisk walk in with a warm-up and cool-down at a more leisurely pace to make a longer walking workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several health benefits to walking — it can boost your cardiovascular fitness, help you build or maintain muscle, lose weight, and as this study found, help your cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to walking with good form, think about keeping your torso upright by engaging your core, sucking your belly button into your spine.

But now, scientists are sounding the alarm: the Y chromosome is slowly disappearing. Unlike the X, which holds hundreds of genes, the Y has lost most of its genetic content over millions of years. Some researchers predict it could vanish entirely in about 11 million years. While that may seem far away, evidence suggests the effects of Y chromosome loss are already showing up in men today — especially in how they age and stay healthy. The complete study is published in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)00646-3" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Y chromosome is fading in men&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to its counterpart, the X chromosome, which carries around 900 genes, the Y is tiny and holds just about 55 genes. Genetic studies show that over millions of years, the Y chromosome has been steadily losing genes. Researchers estimate that if this trend continues, the Y could disappear completely in roughly 11 million years. That might sound far off, but clues from both animals and humans suggest the effects may already be happening — and they're not just theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Men already losing Y chromosomes in their cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before the chromosome disappears from the species, many men are already starting to lose it in some of their cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting around age 50, some bone marrow cells begin to misplace the Y chromosome during cell division. These Y-less cells multiply, especially in the blood. By the time a man reaches 80, about 4 in 10 have a significant amount of blood cells missing the Y — a condition known as "mosaic loss of Y," or LOY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long-term study in Sweden tracked over 1,100 older men and found that those with LOY had higher risks of cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's, and died an average of 5.5 years earlier than those without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why losing the Y matters to the immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the genes on the Y chromosome, called UTY, helps regulate the immune system. When it’s gone, certain immune cells stop working the way they should. Some start producing more scar tissue, while others become weaker and less able to fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lab tests, mice without the Y chromosome developed faster-growing tumors and more heart damage. In humans, tumors that lack the Y — especially in the bladder — tend to be more dangerous. But there's a twist: these same tumors also respond better to a specific cancer treatment called checkpoint inhibitors. It’s a reminder that biology often works in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Results of the research done on rodents&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some rodent species, like the Japanese spiny rat and certain mole voles, have already lost their Y chromosomes completely — and yet, they still manage to produce male offspring. In 2022, scientists discovered that a copy of DNA near a gene called SOX9 can take over the job of turning on male development, even without the usual Y-linked trigger. This finding suggests that evolution can find workarounds. If the Y disappears in humans one day, it’s possible that a new system could emerge to take its place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can men do to prevent the Y chromosome loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we can't stop evolution, we can slow down the loss of the Y chromosome in our own bodies. Things like smoking, air pollution, and exposure to toxic chemicals speed up DNA damage, including Y chromosome loss. Quitting smoking, avoiding environmental toxins, and leading a healthy lifestyle — with regular exercise, nutritious food, and good sleep — may help preserve more Y-bearing cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some drugs used to treat lung disease are being tested to see if they can prevent the heart damage linked to Y loss. And as medical tests become more advanced and affordable, men might soon be able to get a “Y-loss score” during regular checkups, much like cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A story of evolution and urgency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shrinking Y chromosome sits at a strange crossroads between slow evolutionary change and urgent medical challenges. On one hand, nature seems to have a backup plan for the far future. On the other hand, individual men today are already feeling the consequences in their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a perfect example of how evolution and medicine don’t always share the same timeline. Evolution cares about passing on genes, not about living into your 80s. But for doctors and patients, the immediate risks matter more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the idea of the Y chromosome disappearing sounds alarming, there’s no need for panic. Evolution is adaptable, and medical science is catching up fast. For now, the most practical advice is simple: stay healthy, avoid harmful chemicals, and pay attention to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The complete study is published in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)00646-3" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 06:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>南加州男子德隆·威尔斯（ Deron Wells ）在第4阶段癌症战斗中为双肺移植而进行的保险战后死亡- ABC7洛杉矶 | SoCal man Deron Wells dies after insurance battle for double-lung transplant in stage 4 cancer battle goes viral - ABC7 Los Angeles</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- &lt;/span&gt;A double-lung transplant patient has died after his &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7.com/post/socal-man-wins-appeal-get-life-saving-lung-transplant-battle-cigna-insurance/16397860/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;battle for coverage from his health insurance company&lt;/a&gt; went viral online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Deron Wells died last week, just days after being placed on the list for the transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div class="WrapperInlineVideo"&gt;&lt;div class="VideoCaption nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU eEzcu lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;A man battling stage 4 lung cancer was preparing to fly across the country for a life-changing double-lung transplant when his insurance company denied him coverage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Family and friends say he wanted to share his story and his fight for insurance coverage in hopes of saving others facing a similar battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"In his death, as unfortunate as it is, there is hope that things can change and that next patient will get that care in time so that their 11-year-old son doesn't grow up without a daddy," said Scott Kern, Wells' friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Wells leaves behind a wife and three children.

&lt;p&gt;I prefer in-person yoga and workout classes, but there’s one online instructor whose routines I always search for when I want to move my body at home and that’s Adriene Mishler, aka &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/yoga-with-adriene" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/yoga-with-adriene"&gt;Yoga With Adriene&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s an extremely popular yoga instructor and with over 13 million subscribers she runs one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/best-yoga-youtube-channels" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/best-yoga-youtube-channels"&gt;best yoga YouTube channels&lt;/a&gt;. I like her because her routines are simple, often short and always beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mishler recently shared a new routine that’s just 10 minutes long. She describes it as a “mental health break” to ground the body and the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried during my lunch break to see if I could reduce my stress levels in just 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-watch-yoga-with-adriene-s-mental-health-break"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Watch Yoga With Adriene’s “Mental Health Break”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't need any equipment to do this routine, although a lot of it is done lying down or on your hands and knees, so you may want to roll out your yoga mat or a blanket to make your experience more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, as is always the case with Mishler's videos, it’s a follow-along practice, so just press play when you’re ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-experience-trying-yoga-with-adriene-s-mental-health-break-routine"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My experience trying Yoga With Adriene’s “Mental Health Break” routine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I struggle to switch off during the working day. Even when I leave my desk to go for a walk or for a quick gym session at lunch, I find that I’m still thinking about my to-do list, so I expected my mind to wander while doing this routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wxXayKTp49ptP5iZGRWypa" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wxXayKTp49ptP5iZGRWypa slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, I found that I was able to relax. The first five minutes of the routine is spent lying down and following a guided meditation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mishler talks you through some breathwork, but she encourages you not to try and control or disrupt your breath, but just focus on lengthening it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this, because I often find specific breathing techniques too difficult, particularly when they involve holding my breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By simply focusing on making the breath longer and listening to Mishler's guided meditation, my mind stayed in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second half of the practice involved gentle stretching, which my body needed after sitting at my desk all morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt my muscles and joints actively release as I moved in and out of cat-cow, and the gentle shoulder and neck stretches were especially satisfying after hunching over my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a worthwhile use of my time and I felt much better going back to my desk, both in my body and mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll return to this routine when I’m feeling overwhelmed. It’s only 10 minutes, but it made a lot of difference to my mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
