"These experiences – especially when they're unexpected or surprising – can be very confusing for people and may be isolating," Sevelius says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Ideally, professional support is involved, if not during the trip itself, then in the important work that comes afterward while processing it. "It is really important that psychedelic-assisted therapy practitioners are affirming and aware of the potential for someone's sense of identity to evolve, and to see this not as a negative outcome but as potentially healing," Sevelius says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-bc40c3a0-0 kXcvpr"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 jJmNMc"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images There has been a resurgence in research on the therapeutic use of psychedelics such as psilocybin, which is found in magic mushrooms (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;There has been a resurgence in research on the therapeutic use of psychedelics such as psilocybin, which is found in magic mushrooms (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Many people do not have the resources to seek help from therapists who are competent in psychedelics, identity-affirming integration, LGBTQ+ issues or all three. Family and friends can also provide crucial lifelines for a person processing major shifts to their identity, but again, not everyone has a supportive network. For people raised by caregivers who "talked about never being able to accept a queer kid", Voce says, or who belong to a straight, conservative peer group, "it's much harder to say, 'I'm the person who's going against the grain'".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It can also be difficult if a current romantic partner is not on board. "That can be an identity shift for the other person in the relationship too," says Kayla Knopp, a licensed clinical psychologist and, with Khalifian, a co-founder of Enamory. A husband and wife in their 60s recently came to Knopp, for example, after the husband started exploring bisexuality and gender identity, and trying out cross-dressing. The wife "had a really negative reaction", Knopp says. Tensions were eased somewhat after the couple tried ketamine-assisted therapy and found, afterwards, that they were better able to talk through what this meant for their relationship. "It wasn't a big, dramatic thing," Knopp says. "They just both felt a little more open and softer with each other."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQOElJNG1tR0hNaGdodG1wWFJrUjl4X2thWDhzcm05X2stM0tyUS12MGdnLWpLS0V1dXNtM3g5bTlMN1JSTGtoUGNmYURONkhoME8zRjEzd2lEWXZnUmdrY25DaTVSOElOY1FuTjZyTkFlSmd3bndoU3VhSkM3MXN0bzZWZmlqX1laX0lxLTlzU2pWdzBkTjVYQzlFVVRralVveTNSWGF1RFlyWEFSbEMzaVlOQWVGZw</guid></item><item><title>四张图表中的流感-今年的冬季疫情有何不同- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yq9wr3pnro</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;Flu in four charts -  how this year's winter outbreak is different&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-573fa0e8-0 bWRWzH"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-573fa0e8-11 cOQNNv"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-573fa0e8-5 ciiGlA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-573fa0e8-7 kdBCdE"&gt;Jim Reed,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-573fa0e8-8 eDNgSC"&gt;Health reporter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc-573fa0e8-9 keGieE"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-1" class="sc-573fa0e8-5 ciiGlA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-573fa0e8-7 kdBCdE"&gt;Wesley Stephenson,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-1-role-location" class="sc-573fa0e8-8 eDNgSC"&gt;BBC Verify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 eRlINq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c59f/live/687689b0-d6e1-11f0-aa51-f3f688349a6c.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c59f/live/687689b0-d6e1-11f0-aa51-f3f688349a6c.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c59f/live/687689b0-d6e1-11f0-aa51-f3f688349a6c.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c59f/live/687689b0-d6e1-11f0-aa51-f3f688349a6c.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c59f/live/687689b0-d6e1-11f0-aa51-f3f688349a6c.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c59f/live/687689b0-d6e1-11f0-aa51-f3f688349a6c.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c59f/live/687689b0-d6e1-11f0-aa51-f3f688349a6c.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c59f/live/687689b0-d6e1-11f0-aa51-f3f688349a6c.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A female paramedic opening the door to an ambulance.

But Chris Streather, the medical director for the NHS in London, said the situation was "well within the boundaries" of what the NHS could cope with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;How then is winter 2025 really any different and which patients have been affected most by what the NHS is now describing as "super flu"?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;An earlier start for flu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The major difference between 2025's flu season and the previous three years is that the virus started spreading around a month earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The first sign of this was in October in data published by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;When someone goes to their GP or hospital with flu-like symptoms they can be tested for a number of viruses including influenza, Covid and RSV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;UKHSA records the percentage of those tests that come back positive for flu, which can then give a strong indication that rates in the community are either rising or falling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Virologists have linked the earlier flu season this year to a subtle shift in the genetic makeup of the main flu virus that is circulating - called H3N2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So-called 'super-flu' is not a medical term and it does not mean the virus is more severe or harder to treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the general public has not encountered this exact version of flu before, which means there may be less immunity built up in society, allowing it to spread more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Children and young people most affected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Children tend to be more susceptible to flu than older adults, partly because their immune systems are still developing and because they tend to spread viruses more quickly through close contact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The latest breakdown of UKHSA data shows that the proportion of positive tests is currently much higher in children and young people still at school or university. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some schools have had to bring back Covid-like measures to prevent the spread of the virus, such as cutting back on singing in assemblies and introducing sanitisation stations, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3e0z9433pwo" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;while one site in Caerphilly had to close temporarily&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Each year thousands of otherwise healthy children end up in A&amp;amp;E with complications after catching influenza. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But there is another concern: that younger people will go home and then spread the disease to elderly relatives who tend to be more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Flu adds to winter pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The NHS records the number of patients in hospital each week with influenza and other types of respiratory illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The number has been rising sharply in England with an average of 2,660 flu patients taking up a hospital bed last week, up from 1,717 in the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Those over 85-years-old are five times more likely to be hospitalised than the general population.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the patients being admitted now would have been infected with the virus a week or so ago when infection rates were lower. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The greater concern for the health service is what happens over the coming weeks as new cases appear in A&amp;amp;E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The NHS has roughly 105,000 available hospital beds in England and tends to "run hot" over the winter with 95% of those taken up at any one time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If the number of flu patients needing overnight treatment jumps to 5,000 or higher, as Sir Jim Mackey predicts, then it could put the whole hospital system under more pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;What about vaccine protection?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The message coming from doctors and the NHS is for people in vulnerable groups to continue to come forward for a flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Even though the genetic make-up of the virus has shifted this winter, the main jab is still thought to offer effective protection, particularly against severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The flu vaccine is free on the NHS for those over 65-years-old, young children, pregnant women, those with certain health conditions, carers, and front line health and social care workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;People in other groups can get the same vaccine for between £15 and £25 from high street pharmacists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;As of 30 November, around 70% of older people and care home residents had taken up the offer of a free flu jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But vaccination rates in younger at-risk groups such as the clinically vulnerable were lower at just over 40%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Rates among NHS workers in England, which have fallen back since the Covid pandemic, appear to have stabilised this year at roughly the same level - around 42%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0

						Classes are canceled at a southern Iowa school district Friday, Dec. 12, after a case of whooping cough was confirmed. Officials with Davis County Community School District in Bloomfield said Thursday afternoon that the case of whooping cough, also called pertussis, was confirmed at the elementary school. Pertussis is a contagious respiratory illness. It gets its name based on the "whooping" someone makes while gasping for air after coughing."School will be canceled (Friday) as we continue our investigation and receive guidance from public health officials," Superintendent Megan Christiansen said in a post on the district's Facebook page. School events and activities have been canceled or postponed Thursday, Friday and Saturday, according to the school's activities calendar.Christiansen is also superintendent of Moulton-Udell Community School District, which canceled classes Tuesday and Wednesday due to 30% of students and staff being out — many with influenza A.The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services recommends that Iowans take the following steps to stay healthy this winter:Stay home and avoid social gatherings if you or your children are sick.Clean high-touch surfaces in your home frequently with household disinfectants.Practice hand hygiene frequently with soap and water or hand sanitizer for at least 20 seconds.Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, or if a tissue is not available, cover them with an upper shirt sleeve, not a hand.Keep children home from daycare or school who have fever, cough, congestion, runny nose, or sore throat, and until they are fever-free for 24 hours without medications that reduce fever.If you or a loved one is sick and needs medical care, contact your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider can offer advice on whether you or your child needs to be evaluated in person, tested for flu or other respiratory diseases, and the best location for care.Iowa vaccination rates for whooping coughIowa's 2-year-old immunization rates for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis have risen since 2015, from 68.6% in that year to 89.5% in 2024, according to data on the Iowa Health and Human Services website.In Davis County, the 2-year-old rate is lower for this vaccine, according to HHS.

She had just given birth to her first child. “It was a crossroads moment for me, with the fear of denial, but I chose action,” Karipa, who is now in her 50s, said at an Aids awareness event in Papua New Guinea’s capital Port Moresby in December. She and the baby received treatment, and her child remains healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Karipa, from East Sepik in northern PNG, is unusual in sharing her story. The stigma around the disease is high in the Pacific nation, but speaking out has never been more important. This year PNG declared HIV a “national crisis”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;UNAids, the UN agency that fights HIV/Aids globally, says the epidemic in PNG is among the fastest growing in the Asia-Pacific region, along with Fiji and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;New infections have doubled since 2010 and it is estimated that only 59% of people living with the virus know they are HIV positive. The rise of infections in women and children is particularly alarming, UNAids says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="9b98fb0c-f2a9-4d51-8f76-6ab86dba5580" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Aid cuts have shaken HIV/Aids care to its core – and will mean millions more infections ahead","elementId":"9b98fb0c-f2a9-4d51-8f76-6ab86dba5580","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/01/global-health-hiv-aids-funding-cuts-infections-prevention"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The transmission of [the virus from] mother to child is very high in Papua New Guinea, one of the highest globally,” says Manoela Manova, UNAids country director for PNG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Changes to funding for HIV support and prevention have hit PNG hard. The suspension of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/24/foreign-aid-israel-egypt" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;US foreign aid &lt;/a&gt;by the Trump administration this year has affected hundreds of clinics.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Sharp global reductions in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/01/global-health-hiv-aids-funding-cuts-infections-prevention#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20estimated%20that,than%20it%20was%20in%202023.&amp;amp;text=Winnie%20Byanyima%2C%20the%20UNAids%20executive,was%20shaken%20to%20its%20core.%E2%80%9D" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;funding for UNAids&lt;/a&gt; is also worrying health providers, and calls for the PNG government to do more are growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Manova says HIV awareness has declined over time and now, “it’s like the feeling that the epidemic does not exist”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“That’s the perception in both the public and in the political class.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="20337c4c-3ff1-4dbe-b73f-a3466b30269b" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;There are concerns not enough people in PNG are aware of the threat from HIV/Aids.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Torsten Blackwood/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The crisis in the country of about 10 million people is compounded by a combination of factors, including inadequate testing and lack of awareness. UNAids says PNG recorded an estimated 11,000 new cases in 2024, with nearly half of all new infections &lt;a href="https://unaids-ap.org/2025/06/26/national-hiv-crisis-declared-in-papua-new-guinea/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;among children and people aged under 25&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An estimated 2,700 infants were infected with HIV in PNG in 2024. In most cases, mothers were unaware of their HIV status and didn’t receive the necessary antiretroviral therapy (ART) which could have prevented transmission to their child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“A lot of people do not know their status and that’s the first step to addressing the epidemic [and] to be put on treatment,” Manova says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="us-aid-freeze-hits-clinics" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;US aid freeze hits clinics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The government declared HIV a national crisis in June and put in place an emergency response plan including more testing, treatment and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Deputy secretary of health, Ken Wai, says while the government is responsible for drug supplies, other support services and community outreach has depended heavily on US aid. In January, the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/24/foreign-aid-israel-egypt" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cut foreign aid&lt;/a&gt;, which was distributed through the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/03/elon-musk-says-usaid-is-beyond-repair-and-he-is-working-to-shut-it-down" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;United States Agency for International Development (USA&lt;/a&gt;ID&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/03/elon-musk-says-usaid-is-beyond-repair-and-he-is-working-to-shut-it-down" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;, although Wai says some funding has been restored to specific programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“USAID finances an organisation called FHI360; they help us with data recording, and one laboratory coordinator assists at the central public health laboratory,” Wai says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Chair of the national Aids council, Wep Kanawi, says the government must do more to address the crisis. The council works to prevent HIV transmission and provide treatment across the country. Kanawi says the government does not receive direct funding from USAID for HIV medicines, but PNG does seek funding from global not-for-profit organisations which receive contributions from USAID. That then supports some HIV programs in PNG, including paying staff salaries, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kanawi says more than 200 clinics run by the government or churches that provide HIV services have lost funding after the US suspended foreign aid&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;earlier this year, without providing further details about the services the clinics provide. Kanawi wants the government to do more, and says about K45-K50m (US$10m) annually is needed to deal with the epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Many of our centres are operating but scaling down on their operations,” Kanawi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kaugere Clinic in Port Moresby, which provides HIV and other health services, is one of the centres affected by the funding freeze. Rose Marai, a social worker at the clinic, says when aid was suspended by the Trump administration, salaries at the clinic were withheld because there was no funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There was no second plan given to us and we were told to close down the clinic, which had affected the communities,” Marai says. “I used to receive K1,000 (US$235) to run a day awareness program in communities but since the stop of funding I now receive K240 monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I started doing voluntary counselling of referral patients who were already tested positive, STI and gender-based violence couples.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The US embassy in PNG did not respond to questions about USAID or US funding. In a statement, it said the US is “committed to our partnership with Papua New Guinea”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“US foreign assistance to PNG, managed through the Department of State and other US agencies, includes robust programs in security cooperation, disaster preparedness, and health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/12/embed-80-zip/giv-32554hrsJrk2qEbpv","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"map of png","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":0},"elementId":"142cbcf8-12ab-4a43-8dc2-a4bd3215bee0","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="142cbcf8-12ab-4a43-8dc2-a4bd3215bee0" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="map of png" data-testid="interactive-element-map%20of%20png" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/12/embed-80-zip/giv-32554hrsJrk2qEbpv" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;map of png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the same time, UNAids has this year seen what it describes as a “historic funding crisis” because of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jul/04/us-aid-cuts-kill-millions-unaids-head-winnie-byanyima" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cuts in the US foreign aid budget&lt;/a&gt; and reductions from &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/01/global-health-hiv-aids-funding-cuts-infections-prevention#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20estimated%20that,than%20it%20was%20in%202023.&amp;amp;text=Winnie%20Byanyima%2C%20the%20UNAids%20executive,was%20shaken%20to%20its%20core.%E2%80%9D" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;other donor countries.&lt;/a&gt; A December report from UNAids said abrupt funding reductions and persistent funding shortfalls “are having profound, lasting effects on the health” of millions of people, although it noted funding for some HIV programs has restarted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;UNAids in PNG say the country has so far been shielded from the hit as Australia stepped in with additional funding. In October, the Australian government said it would “increase its annual HIV development funding to almost A$10m this financial year”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Manova says additional funding from Australia will help maintain the UNAids office in PNG “for another two years”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Still, concerns are rising in PNG that the epidemic highlights the fragility of the health sector and the heavy reliance on foreign aid, amid a surge in infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Foreign minister Justin Tkatchenko says the country needs a “fallback position”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The longterm strategy is doing it ourselves. We can’t continually rely on other donor partners to help us,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rebecca Bush contributed to this report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:49:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPamZuakpfUWt6MTlJTmFxZTIzeGdDdTJFMnZDd3ZjVFBGSWZzMDBFTWdpb3lvSzN3VG1ZS1VTeVRnTGdjejJHc1o1MlpTZ0ExX1c4Zm9jSzlPNG9JZk5ZRnJTdFFwTXNxX1FkbGR0RW5HV1N0MHFId0E4cGVQM0o3MUkyci1ub1liS1FyUloyWkhJcC0yRjVoQzJ3</guid></item><item><title>医生把我的脱发和头晕说成“只是一个疲惫的妈妈” - BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2peeljp1po</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;Doctor wrote off my hair loss and dizziness as 'just being a tired mum'&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-573fa0e8-0 bWRWzH"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-573fa0e8-11 cOQNNv"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-573fa0e8-5 gXJgDY"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="sc-573fa0e8-7 gqeTMs"&gt;Joe McFadden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-573fa0e8-8 bIfajQ"&gt;Health reporter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gtLOOD"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e3b2/live/85ae4e40-d066-11f0-8039-b97ff13472bc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e3b2/live/85ae4e40-d066-11f0-8039-b97ff13472bc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e3b2/live/85ae4e40-d066-11f0-8039-b97ff13472bc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e3b2/live/85ae4e40-d066-11f0-8039-b97ff13472bc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e3b2/live/85ae4e40-d066-11f0-8039-b97ff13472bc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e3b2/live/85ae4e40-d066-11f0-8039-b97ff13472bc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e3b2/live/85ae4e40-d066-11f0-8039-b97ff13472bc.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e3b2/live/85ae4e40-d066-11f0-8039-b97ff13472bc.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Rose Stokes A blonde woman with black, square glasses holding a blonde male toddler over her shoulder" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Rose Stokes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Rose Stokes is a freelance journalist and mother of two&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;After giving birth to her second child, Rose Stokes was exhausted all the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I couldn't really do anything more than the bare minimum in terms of looking after my kids.

This is important because, as we age, the risk of falls increases, with one in four American adults age 65 and older falling each year.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While this may not sound like a big deal, falls are the leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injuries in this age group.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Injuries from falls also add up to more than $80 billion in healthcare costs each year in the U.S.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that many falls are preventable with some strategic planning. Part of this includes &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/afternoon-habit-women-after-50-for-healthy-aging-11830800" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incorporating exercises&lt;/a&gt; into your routine that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/walking-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them-7158418" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;strengthen muscles related to walking&lt;/a&gt; and standing, and you don't have to go to the gym to do them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DR5Js54koWf/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Instagram post&lt;/a&gt;, Joy Bhat, M.D., shared insights into how her 79-year-old father, &lt;a href="https://jivahealth.com/providers/naras-bhat-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Naras Bhat, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, became a "super ager" by staying strong, sharp, mobile and independent. "It's not luck," writes Bhat. "It's these five habits he does every single day."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--instagram"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bhat notes that the best part is that what her dad does isn't an actual workout. "They're simple, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-add-movement-limited-time-11772724" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;habit-stacked movements&lt;/a&gt; built into his morning and daily routine. Because longevity isn't created only in the gym. It's created in the moments you repeat, day after day."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Habit stacking is a strategy used to help people change their habits. You incorporate (or stack) the new habit you're trying to create with habits you already have. For example, doing side and rear leg lifts while you wash dishes or push-ups off the kitchen counter while making lunches.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here's how Bhat habit-stacks his exercises throughout the day to stay strong:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-glute-bridges"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Glute Bridges  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before even getting out of bed, Bhat does &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7949443/best-strength-training-exercises/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;glute bridges&lt;/a&gt;, which strengthen the glutes (butt muscles), hamstrings (back of thigh muscles) and hips. You can also get the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-for-better-balance-and-stability-11800652" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;core muscles&lt;/a&gt; involved by intentionally pulling your belly button in toward your spine while holding the bridge pose. All of these muscle groups play a crucial role in walking and balance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-one-legged-standing"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; One-Legged Standing &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While Bhat brushes his teeth, he stands on one leg while lightly holding onto the bathroom sink. Balance tends to be one of the first skills that weaken as we age, so being intentional about incorporating exercises that safely &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7917613/exercises-to-improve-balance/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;challenge balance&lt;/a&gt; is imperative.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-heel-and-toe-raises"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Heel and Toe Raises &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While facing the bathroom sink and holding onto it, Bhat does heel and toe raises. Heel raises strengthen the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021161/what-to-eat-to-build-muscle/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calf muscles&lt;/a&gt;, while toe raises focus on the shin muscles. Both are involved with keeping the legs and ankles strong. To hit all parts of the calf muscles, perform three different sets of heel raises: one with toes pointing forward, one with feet turned out and one with feet turned in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-sit-stands"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Sit-Stands &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the dinner table, Bhat does sit-stands. This involves standing up from a sitting position without pushing off with your hands, then slowly sitting back down without plopping down or using your hands. This can also be done while watching TV or sitting at your desk. This exercise targets several muscle groups, including front and rear thighs (quads and hamstrings), glutes and core muscles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-planks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Planks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; During Bhat's computer breaks, he does planks. In the reel, it shows Bhat doing full planks with arms and legs extended. This is more of an advanced plank, so feel free to modify it by keeping your knees on the floor. You can also go onto your forearms. No matter which position you choose, the primary goal is to pull the belly button up toward the spine, keep the head in line with your spine (in other words, your chin should not be on your chest) and keep your elbows in alignment with your shoulders. Remember to breathe throughout the exercise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's essential to remember you're never too young or too old to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/expert-reveals-what-leads-to-longevity-11831397" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;focus on healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;, and consistency is the key to cultivating new habits. "Healthy aging is built in small moments," says Bhat. "And as my dad shows every day, it's never too late to start!"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to make some changes to your routine for healthier aging, we recommend pairing these exercises with meals chock-full of foods that can help support your health as you get older, including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-for-cognitive-function-after-age-60-11807629" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plenty of veggies, fish and plant protein&lt;/a&gt;.

It’s concerning, she said, because Utah hasn’t had this many measles cases in more than 30 years. Nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 1,912 cases in 2025 — the highest number since the disease was considered eliminated here in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The U.S. could actually lose that declared status soon if any outbreak lasts more than 12 months. Canada recently lost its status as a country where measles was eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In Utah specifically, it doesn’t help that measles was first seen largely in the southern part of the state near the Arizona border, but there have now been cases in central and northern Utah, too, according to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services’ &lt;a href="https://files.epi.utah.gov/Utah%20measles%20dashboard.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://files.epi.utah.gov/Utah%20measles%20dashboard.html"&gt;measles dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Thursday, during a media briefing, Nolen said that cases have been confirmed recently in Salt Lake, Davis, Utah and Wasatch counties, among others. And they’re expecting to learn of more because measles is an incredibly contagious illness that can linger in the air for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;If 20 people who were unvaccinated or never had measles were to be exposed, 18 of them would come down with measles, Nolen said. It’s more contagious than the flu or COVID-19 or pretty much anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A happy note, according to Nolen and Dorothy Adams, a Salt Lake County Health expert speaking on behalf of the Utah Association of Local Health Departments, is that about 90% of Utah residents are vaccinated against measles. Tempering that is the fact that herd immunity requires a 95% vaccination rate. When enough people are vaccinated, it largely stops the spread, shielding those who for various reasons cannot be vaccinated, including very young babies, who Nolen described as very vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2179"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/JUBD5DDJFVA3RA4T3MGGDMTCNI.JPG?auth=eb978da8f0db7fe049a00ab362f75c9908ef1709ce209121d6a26d1d1aaf3348&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=581" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/JUBD5DDJFVA3RA4T3MGGDMTCNI.JPG?auth=eb978da8f0db7fe049a00ab362f75c9908ef1709ce209121d6a26d1d1aaf3348&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1162 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;The Utah state epidemiologist, Dr. Leisha Nolen, left, and Dorothy Adams of Salt Lake County Health, representing the Utah Association of Local Health Departments, speak with reporters about the measles update at the Multi-Agency State Office Building in Salt Lake City on Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Laura Seitz, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Nearly 70% of the cases have involved children and the vast majority of those who have been infected have not been vaccinated, they said, though there were seven breakthrough cases where someone had at least partial vaccination and still got sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="A-miserable-and-maybe-dangerous-illness" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;A miserable and maybe dangerous illness&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Measles cases can be mild, but they aren’t always. So far in Utah, 12 people have required hospitalization in 2025, according to the dashboard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Those at highest risk of complications include children younger than 5, adults over 20, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; said that complications range from common ills like ear infections, diarrhea and pneumonia — which is a common cause of deaths that can occur — to brain inflammation that can lead to permanent damage and a rare but fatal brain disease called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis that shows up years after someone apparently recovered from measles. Pregnant women can miscarry or deliver too soon or have low-birthweight babies. And complications for those with compromised immune systems, young children and adults over age 20 can include blindness and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Measles has a timeline of sorts. Typically people have a high fever, cough, runny nose and red watery eyes for a few days, then they develop little white spots inside their mouth two or three days after that. Between three and five days, usually, after symptoms begin, the familiar rash pops up, usually on the face at the hairline before moving down and covering the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2223"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/OOTJY5HBTFAA7NWDHEA5V62NKM.JPG?auth=0068dc8e4ae0ea86d29aaa7c8a7767d0e7943cd54fdc3ba0a5a365e41856db2c&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=592" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/OOTJY5HBTFAA7NWDHEA5V62NKM.JPG?auth=0068dc8e4ae0ea86d29aaa7c8a7767d0e7943cd54fdc3ba0a5a365e41856db2c&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1184 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Jody deJonge, R.N., holds a multi-dose vial of the measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccination at the Salt Lake Public Health Center in Salt Lake City on Wednesday, July 9, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Laura Seitz, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="Reducing-risk-of-spread" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Reducing risk of spread&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Earlier Thursday during a national briefing on vaccine schedules hosted by the National Press Foundation, Dr. Mona Amin, a board-certified pediatrician who founded &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-pedsdoctalk-podcast-child-health-development/id1501057527" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;PedsDocTalk&lt;/a&gt;, said the risk of the illness itself is not worth taking, given how well tolerated the vaccine is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While vaccines were hailed as the best way to prevent the spread of measles — Nolen called it 95% effective and said it has a decades-long history of being safe with mild side effects — the briefing was also about other ways to stop the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Call ahead if you think you’re sick or were exposed was advice from both Adams and Nolen, who said that showing up in a doctor’s office and waiting increases the likelihood that others in the waiting room could become infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That allows health care providers to take precautions to protect other patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The need to protect babies came up several times in the briefing, because babies don’t usually qualify for that vaccine until they’re at least a year old, though with so many cases around, Nolen said there’s an option to get a baby vaccinated for measles at 6 months. In normal times, with little spread, she said that’s not usually recommended, but she called it “reasonable” given the surge in cases. Those babies would also get a dose at the regular time, so it’s an extra dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Others who are not vaccinated but are exposed can also get a measles vaccination and if it’s done within days, it can offer some protection and reduce the risk of serious illness, per Nolen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Adams talked about contact tracing as a tool to stop the spread of measles, noting that the investigations are done to prevent spread. When a case is confirmed, health departments reach out to learn where the person had been with the goal of warning those who might have been exposed to watch for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2136"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/EOKCBV3RDZFUHM2RXNACJU63XM.JPG?auth=deaaeacf2be8a40a4352af68bf5d93e045ace28ea2523b777ae96b4a2d728754&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=569" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/EOKCBV3RDZFUHM2RXNACJU63XM.JPG?auth=deaaeacf2be8a40a4352af68bf5d93e045ace28ea2523b777ae96b4a2d728754&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1138 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Dorothy Adams of Salt Lake County Health, representing the Utah Association of Local Health Departments, speaks with reporters about the measles update at the Multi-Agency State Office Building in Salt Lake City on Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Laura Seitz, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She acknowledged that people might be suspicious to receive a phone call from a stranger asking health questions, and encouraged anyone who isn’t sure to call their local health department and verify that the person who called them works there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She asked that people do that instead of letting worry prevent them from answering questions that could reduce spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Because many people don’t suspect measles until they have the signature rash, there’s not a big window to offer symptom-reducing treatment. So prevention is key, said Adams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 23:54:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPRFRsR0pQY0hWRU1GcGx6VVFwSzhQZU9qTDlOQlRXdTc5T1RnUTdQRGxpUTByd3N2TUV3WDFOSks3bmZZRk9nb0ppTm5SbFdEWGl6N1poaEtQNThmQjc0bkZMaGNLZ1FKQ0R4TmNCTEZKWnhIVHRaMmtlMC04dFBCUXBWSlZzVXJGejRKQXVuc0xTeUhlYlNtblZyQXkyZUE</guid></item><item><title>妻子说， CDC疫苗小组的新主席被儿科诊所解雇- thehill.com</title><link>https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5645398-milhoan-cardiology-termination-acip-cdc/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

While some countries restrict or even ban sales of energy drinks to those under 18, the United States has no federal regulations—leading many to assume they're safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Interestingly, the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="FDA" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; also states that "pure and highly concentrated caffeine products can have serious health consequences, including death." &lt;a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/18/12/e267441" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/18/12/e267441" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="One study" data-node-id="1.3" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found high morbidity and mortality rates associated with stroke and cardiovascular disease linked to high-sugar drink consumption.

When we drink energy drinks, our bodies are more alert and focused, thanks in part to an increase in adrenaline. The specific effects—as well as their intensity and duration—depend on the individual and total caffeine consumed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-are-energy-drinks-different-than-coffee" data-node-id="8" class="body-h2 css-guqo8m emevuu60"&gt;How Are Energy Drinks Different Than Coffee?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-15" data-node-id="9" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-y6m8k e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-1am3yn9 e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-10bgxwr e1geg53v2"&gt;Dan Kitwood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-10t3vcu e1geg53v0"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-10bgxwr e1geg53v1"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;It's complicated. The category is huge, and there’s no single comparison that fits every brand. Generally, though, many energy drinks deliver more caffeine per serving than a standard cup of coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wowmd.com/pages/catherine-gervacio" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.wowmd.com/pages/catherine-gervacio" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Catherine Gervacio" data-node-id="11.0" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;Catherine Gervacio&lt;/a&gt;, RND, a registered nutritionist and diet consultant for WOWMD, notes that an average 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee contains about 95-100 mg of caffeine. Energy drinks vary wildly, but often contain between 70 to 200 mg per serving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Caffeine sources differ, too, which can affect overall nutritional value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Different sources contain not only caffeine but also other beneficial compounds like antioxidants and minerals, which can contribute to the overall nutritional value,” says Dasgupta. “For example, green tea is rich in antioxidants, which many energy drinks don’t have, giving it an edge in terms of health. Guarana and yerba mate also include natural compounds that can enhance mood and energy. On the other hand, artificial or heavily processed caffeine sources often miss out on these benefits.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The biggest difference is often the sugar content. &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/just-for-fun/a63325264/is-coffee-healthy-to-drink-every-day/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/just-for-fun/a63325264/is-coffee-healthy-to-drink-every-day/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Coffee" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;Coffee&lt;/a&gt; can be sweetened to personal taste; many energy drinks are high in added sugar. A single 16-oz can of &lt;a href="https://www.rockstarenergy.com/products/the-original" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.rockstarenergy.com/products/the-original" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rockstar’s original formula" data-node-id="15.3" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;Rockstar’s original formula&lt;/a&gt; packs a whopping 63 grams of sugar—127% of the daily recommended intake. Other brands opt for artificial sweeteners, which have been linked in research to a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a41136822/study-artificial-sweeteners-linked-to-higher-risk-of-heart-disease/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a41136822/study-artificial-sweeteners-linked-to-higher-risk-of-heart-disease/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="heart disease and stroke" data-node-id="15.5" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;heart disease and stroke&lt;/a&gt; over time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-safe-are-energy-drinks" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-guqo8m emevuu60"&gt;How Safe Are Energy Drinks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Health officials say that no matter what your caffeinated beverage of choice is, you should consume it in moderation. Dasgupta notes that most healthy adults can safely consume up to 400 mg of caffeine per day without experiencing adverse health effects. “Too much caffeine can lead to jitters, trouble sleeping, a racing heart, and sometimes headaches or an upset stomach,” he says. “In the long run, regularly overdoing it on caffeine can make you dependent on it and need more to get the same boost.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Those with certain health conditions should be especially cautious. “For people &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/just-for-fun/g43784840/best-and-worst-foods-for-anxiety/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/just-for-fun/g43784840/best-and-worst-foods-for-anxiety/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dealing with anxiety" data-node-id="19.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;dealing with anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and other mental issues, caffeine can possibly make the symptoms worse since it stimulates the nervous system. It may also interfere with sleep for those who struggle with it already,” Gervacio says. “People with cardiovascular issues may want to modify their intake or avoid caffeine as it may cause a rise in heart rate and blood pressure.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Antioxidants and added supplements may look appealing on the label, but the high sugar, high caffeine, and preservatives cancel out any other potential benefits—and you can get the same nutrients from whole foods like fruits and vegetables.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“In general, energy drinks are not a ‘healthy’ choice since many are loaded with sugar and artificial stuff, plus high caffeine doses,” Dasgupta says. “Some energy drinks without added sugar can give you a quick energy lift, but natural sources like coffee or &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food/a64443359/coffee-vs-tea-health-benefits/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/food/a64443359/coffee-vs-tea-health-benefits/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="tea" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt; are usually better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you &lt;em data-node-id="22.1"&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; choose to enjoy an energy drink, it’s recommended that you read the label closely and keep your total daily caffeine intake in check.

If successful, the vaccine would teach the immune system to make T-cells that attack and destroy cells with the protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0bb0ab" class="body-graf"&gt;The latest findings of the Phase 1 clinical trial, which included 35 women, were presented Thursday at the &lt;a href="https://sabcs.org/" target="_blank"&gt;San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium&lt;/a&gt; in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-629f7a" class="body-graf"&gt;The trial looked at whether the vaccine was safe and if it triggered an immune response in three groups of patients. (It did not look at how the vaccine affected outcomes.) The first group, which included Johnson, was women who had recovered from early stage triple-negative breast cancer and were tumor-free but at high risk for recurrence. The second was women who had undergone treatment for early-stage disease and had remaining tumor cells. The third group had not yet been diagnosed with breast cancer, but carried a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/guidelines-say-more-women-may-need-breast-cancer-gene-test-n1044416" target="_blank"&gt;genetic predisposition&lt;/a&gt;, such as the BRCA gene, that put them at high risk for triple-negative cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cfafae" class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers found that 74% of the women developed an immune response to the vaccine — though what that result means for reducing recurrence or preventing disease is still unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-add13c" class="body-graf"&gt;“Whether this immune response will translate into reducing the risk of recurrence or preventing breast cancer, we don’t know that yet,” said trial leader Dr. G. Thomas Budd, a breast cancer medical oncologist at Cleveland Clinic’s Cancer Institute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e87643" class="body-graf"&gt;The vaccine also appeared to be safe: Women reported redness or a lump at the injection site, but no serious adverse events were seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cea253" class="body-graf"&gt;One concern was whether the vaccine would trigger an autoimmune response, where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body. Women naturally produce α-lactalbumin when lactating, which the vaccine could train the body to attack. Because of this, Budd said he doesn’t recommend that women who want to breastfeed enroll in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f1a331" class="body-graf"&gt;The Phase 1 results, while promising, only represent an early step in determining whether the vaccine will prove successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-614604" class="body-graf"&gt;A Phase 2 trial is expected to begin late next year. That trial will be the first to look at whether the vaccine can reduce the risk of a triple-negative breast cancer recurrence. If that goes well, future trials will test prevention in patients with a genetic risk, Budd said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-51565b" class="body-graf"&gt;Justin Balko, co-leader of the Breast Cancer Research Program at Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, said the most promising use for the vaccine would be to prevent a first cancer occurrence or a recurrence, rather than target lingering cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c283b" class="body-graf"&gt;That’s because over time, tumor cells can learn how to hide target proteins from the immune system, Balko said. New cancer cells are less likely to develop this ability, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-707391" class="body-graf"&gt;Vaccine exploration for triple-negative breast cancer is a welcome task, said Dr. Larry Norton, founding medical director of the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The most effective targeted breast cancer treatments need estrogen or HER2 receptors to be present in tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4f1e71" class="body-graf"&gt;“Triple-negative doesn’t have either, so we are left only with chemotherapy,” Norton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d45de1" class="body-graf"&gt;Even if the α-lactalbumin-targeting vaccine is not effective in a Phase 2 trial, Norton said scientists are getting better at identifying the abnormal molecules found on different tumor cells. Those abnormalities serve as targets for novel therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2e75a8" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“There was a time when we would say HER2 is the worst type of breast cancer you can have, then along came HER2-targeting therapies and now all of the sudden one of the worst prognosis markers becomes one of the best,” Norton said. “This could be the story of triple-negative breast cancer if we find a target for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQYzA1Ty1wUGlDUmF1c241Smx1MGh0TVUzYkNvQ2lsRE1seGlwbkQ2VmJjQnM1NDBuazU2YkJwYllhWHRHQjhrSW01Y2ZqTjNycFFoY1ZvSGEwdmhnUTFjbHBxaDhPdGNxSzNhR1E3QlB2YnpLUDcxR1duY0p6Z1p5NW1haGZEOEMtb1FiejBHdmFIQ2E2bFVaMElfOFNkVGJueG9qUHhfS252YmRzOEtQOGptTEdhZW9TcGJB0gFWQVVfeXFMTjgxNXlERU5OMlBkSHk0UlBDUjJQMFBLaTFPUzQ4U19ULXNxNW9BdlRPcDVNSDNTRFZ1aGxRQm1hLTN4OU1yQ3M4TExMOEZWRnAycERxZnc</guid></item><item><title>感冒了？医生警告说，最喜欢的舒适食品可能会让你感觉更糟- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/news/sick-cold-doctors-warn-favorite-130021537.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we approach winter — and all the illnesses that come with this time of year — many Americans are looking for proactive measures to protect their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between loading up on citrus fruits and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eating fresh vegetables,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;eating fresh vegetables,&lt;/a&gt; it's worthwhile to build up a healthy immune system to protect against germs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when you're hit with a cold or the flu, which foods will help you recover — and which ones will make the illness worse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/researchers-say-millions-ditched-bread-no-reason-heres-whats-really-happening" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Researchers Say Millions Ditched Bread For No Reason — Here's What's Really Happening;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Researchers Say Millions Ditched Bread For No Reason — Here's What's Really Happening&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital spoke with medical experts about the worst foods to eat while you're sick — many of which are common choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out four items to avoid — and what to choose instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Many Americans are seeking ways to stay healthy as flu season kicks into high gear.

A spokesperson for HHS declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“We have a men's health crisis in this country. Now we need a national strategy,” Christine said as part of a call for creating so-called Men's Health Centers of Excellence across the country that would collaborate with one another, share information, and generate data to inform policy and programs around men’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Participants in Wednesday’s FDA panel—which included federal health officials, urologists, experts on male sexual health, and the CEO of a TRT pharmaceutical company—voiced support for expanding the eligibility criteria for TRT and removing testosterone from the FDA’s list of controlled substances. Earlier this year the FDA held a similar panel on hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/hhs-advances-womens-health-removes-misleading-fda-warnings-hormone-replacement-therapy"&gt;announced in November&lt;/a&gt; that it would remove a black-box warning from the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The Trump administration has aggressively canceled equity and transgender initiatives across the government and cut &lt;a class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/health/trump-administration-slashes-research-into-lgbtq-health.html"}' href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/health/trump-administration-slashes-research-into-lgbtq-health.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hundreds of millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; in funding for research into women’s and LGBTQ health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;During the panel discussion, Christine called attention to men’s health more broadly, pointing out the widening gender gap in life expectancy in the US and that &lt;a href="https://newsroom.clevelandclinic.org/2023/09/06/cleveland-clinic-survey-examines-the-current-state-of-mens-health-in-america"&gt;44 percent of men&lt;/a&gt; surveyed in 2023 didn’t get an annual physical. While rates of depression are similar among men and women, men are much less likely to seek treatment, despite suicide rates in the US being much higher in men.

[Flu] rates are increasing,” said Tim Uyeki, MD, MPH, MPP, the chief medical officer of the Influenza Division at CDC. Uyeki said that last year saw high morbidity and mortality with only moderate flu vaccine efficacy (VE). Most important, he said, there was a significant number of severe flu cases among children, with 288 deaths.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s the highest number of deaths we’ve seen since CDC starting tracking this data,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year the CDC confirmed 37 cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), a rapid and severe swelling of the brain following infections. Uyeki said, of the 37 patients, only six (16%) were vaccinated against flu, and the average age of ANE patients was 5 years.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANE comes on quickly, within two days of flu symptoms, he explained, and 74% of patients end up admitted to intensive care units. Last year, 15 (41%) of the 37 patients with ANE died.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US dominated by H3N2 activity so far&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uyeki said the United States has not yet seen the swift and early flu activity reported by the United Kingdom and Japan, though, like those countries, flu activity is so far dominated by influenza A(H3N2) subclade K.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have not seen early activity compared to other countries, but cases are now increasing throughout the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have not seen early activity compared to other countries, but cases are now increasing throughout the US, and influenza H3N2 is increasing and is being reported,” he said. So far of the H3N2 cases subtyped by the CDC this season, 87% are subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisa A. Grohskopf, MD, MPH, also a medical officer in the CDC’s Influenza Division, emphasized that all children six months and older should be vaccinated, and said flu vaccines formulated without thimerosal are preferred.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32711/HHS-approves-flu-vaccines-without-thimerosal"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thimerosal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a preservative that has been proven safe in countless studies, but it has become a target of anti-vaccine advocates. This summer, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted in favor of using only single-dose influenza vaccines without thimerosal for the current season.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rise in subclade K in some global regions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON586"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In related news&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the World Health Organization (WHO), in a global situation report on seasonal flu yesterday, said subclade K infections are rapidly rising in some countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although global activity remains within expected seasonal ranges, early increases and higher activity than typical at this time of year have been observed in some regions,” the WHO said, noting the rise of subclade K infections.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the CDC official and the WHO said preliminary UK data show that the current seasonal vaccine offers strong protection against subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Early estimates suggest that the influenza vaccine continues to provide protection against hospital attendance in both children and adults, even though its effectiveness against clinical disease during the current season remains uncertain,” the WHO said.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

in over four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.trumbull-ct.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=2959" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;a notice posted to the town website&lt;/a&gt; Thursday, Trumbull officials said the town's administration and the Trumbull Health Department were notified of a confirmed case of measles involving an unvaccinated child under the age of 10 at Christian Heritage School, a private school that teaches students from kindergarten through 12th grade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the town, local health officials are working closely with the school's administration and the Connecticut Department of Public Health to ensure all proper precautions are being taken to ensure the health and well-being of all students, faculty and residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock__MjFe8 ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock--mobile__nW8lf"&gt;&lt;section class="styles_SubscribeForm__h3Jpx"&gt;&lt;h2 class="styles_SubscribeForm__title__k8VOX"&gt;Find out what's happening in Trumbull&lt;span class="styles_SubscribeForm__title--nextLine__xasJy"&gt;for free with the latest updates from Patch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="exco-playerDesktopNative" data-exs-config='{"customParams":{"slot":"exco","user":"false"}}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trumbull health officials will continue to closely monitor the situation and update the community, according to the town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The town also provided &lt;span class="redactor-unlink"&gt;a letter&lt;/span&gt; sent Thursday to Christian Heritage School parents by the Trumbull Health Department, which is &lt;a href="https://www.trumbull-ct.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=2959" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;available to read in full here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock__MjFe8 ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock--desktop__irxNV"&gt;&lt;section class="styles_SubscribeForm__h3Jpx"&gt;&lt;h2 class="styles_SubscribeForm__title__k8VOX"&gt;Find out what's happening in Trumbull&lt;span class="styles_SubscribeForm__title--nextLine__xasJy"&gt;for free with the latest updates from Patch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the letter, health officials said a member of the school community with measles was present at the school on Dec. 4.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unvaccinated or undervaccinated children and adults, including those who have a medical or other exemption to vaccination, must be excluded from school for 21 days after their most recent exposure, which the letter noted was through Dec. 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents of students who are unvaccinated or undervaccinated will be contacted by the school nursing department, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the letter, measles is a viral infection that spreads through coughing and sneezing and is very contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most school-aged children who are fully vaccinated with two doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine are protected from measles, however three in 100 people who have received two doses of MMR vaccine will still get measles if exposed to the virus, according to the letter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Therefore, we want to provide you with information about measles and the signs and symptoms to look for in your child," the letter reads. "Usually about 8-12 days (but up to 21 days) after exposure, measles begins with a mild to moderate fever accompanied by cough, runny nose and red eyes. Two or three days later, the fever spikes, often as high as 104-105°F. At the same time, a red blotchy rash appears, usually first on the face, along the hairline and behind the ears. The rash rapidly spreads downward to the chest and back and, finally, to the thighs and feet."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the letter, most students with measles are sick enough that they miss at least a week of school. One in every 20 people with measles develops pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More rarely, serious or even life-threatening complications can occur, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"If your child is not in compliance with the MMR requirements, they should receive a dose of MMR vaccine, unless there is a valid, documented medical reason why they cannot receive the vaccine," the letter reads. "We recommend that you contact your healthcare provider for immunization as soon as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For families who do not have a healthcare provider, their child may receive the immunization for a fee by appointment at the Trumbull Health Department, located at 335 White Plains Road, by calling 203-452-1030, according to the letter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"If your child develops an illness with fever (101°F or more), cough, runny nose or red eyes, with or without rash, immediately call your doctor and let them know about your child's exposure and symptoms so that they can tell you what to do next," the letter reads. "Your doctor can make special arrangements to evaluate you, if needed, without putting other patients and medical office staff at risk. Keep your child at home until the doctor and the school staff have cleared him/her to return."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyone with questions is encouraged to call the Trumbull Nursing Department at 203-452-5090 or the Trumbull Health Department at 203-452-1030. More information about measles is available &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;on the CDC website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the state Department of Public Health &lt;a href="https://patch.com/connecticut/across-ct/measles-case-confirmed-ct-heres-everything-you-need-know"&gt;announced a confirmed case of measles&lt;/a&gt; in an unvaccinated Fairfield County child under the age of 10 but did not identify the town where the case was reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the first case of measles in Connecticut in more than four years. Nationwide, more than 1,800 cases of measles have been reported in 2025 — the most since the virus was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 and the most cases in more than three decades, according to the International Vaccine Access Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the DPH, the child recently traveled internationally and began showing symptoms of measles several days later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those symptoms included cough, runny nose, congestion, fever and eventually a rash starting at the head and spreading throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;See also: &lt;a href="https://patch.com/connecticut/across-ct/measles-case-confirmed-ct-heres-everything-you-need-know"&gt;Measles Case Confirmed In CT: Here's Everything You Need To Know&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, 9 out of 10 unvaccinated individuals who encounter an infected person will become infected with the measles virus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles can be dangerous, especially for children under the age of five. About 1 in 5 unvaccinated people in the U.S. who get measles end up being hospitalized, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles generally begin 7–14 days after the exposure to an infected person. A typical case of measles begins with mild to moderate fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and sore throat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three to five days after the start of these symptoms, a red or reddish-brown rash appears, usually starting on a person's face at the hairline and spreading downward to the entire body. At the time the rash appears, a person's fever may spike to more than 104 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The single best way to protect your children and yourself from measles is to be vaccinated," DPH Commissioner Manisha Juthani said in a news release. "One dose of measles vaccine is about 93% effective, while two doses are about 97% effective. We must ensure we continue to protect those who matter most — children and other vulnerable people — from vaccine preventable illnesses through on-time vaccination."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DPH, the American Academy of Pediatrics and several other organizations recommend children get two doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A total of 98.2 percent of Connecticut students were vaccinated with two doses of MMR by kindergarten, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state's MMR vaccination rate is the highest in the country, officials said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl SubscribeCTABlurb_SubscribeCTABlurb__5x0v2"&gt;Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox. &lt;a target="_blank" href="/connecticut/trumbull/subscribe" class=""&gt;Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiBox-root css-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 20:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNWnZvemVtVHVJVWFuWUpFYUFqSUhPUlc0cmVrV0FEZEJzc19zWEpCS1NkR2FvTjVVa1ZQRkNXSXBFT3RGb2lNLXFXWFlGQ19SUG44cjlsanRVU205ZFZjaTdPTXRmWWlRalRPNW1GOFo1Y0NxWFFPWV92eXRVUnVEMnV4T0I4UVQ3WDFYd0ozZFIyb3FxWkt4TmdGVdIBsAFBVV95cUxObUVnbTNIdl9GSjA1VkZsN3VXeFFXN1dERGVfVEg4ZjlNSDJPZVVfZXN5b1Rsb2g0My1ScXY3a25fYjY2TmtQNUw0RFR0MnQySjlqOTFpX25PVFpuOWZxTWgtVkIyRjU1czF6dmZadlRFTUxKYk1RNUtqVU4yTms0a3hUNTJZR013eTE3TWlhRXhUWnhXVF9uamdKVEstSkQyQ3FFMVhsS3FtOTk4N0JmWA</guid></item><item><title>家庭警告：一名Farmville中学生患有肺结核- WRAL</title><link>https://www.wral.com/lifestyles/health/tb-tuberculosis-north-carolina-middle-school-december-2025/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Parents in Pitt County were notified this week that a middle school student tested positive for tuberculosis (TB). &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Though there is no immediate public health risk from this exposure, we are investigating the possible exposures and will inform staff and parents/guardians of students who need to be tested to ensure that any potential exposure to TB is identified,” said Pitt County Health Director Wes Gray.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis is a contagious bacterial infection that can be spread when an infected person speaks or coughs. Common symptoms are a cough, chest pain and fatigue. TB can be cured with a course of antibiotics, but recovery can take months.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Staff at Farmville Middle School will test students who are believed to have been exposed to TB, and anyone who tests positive will be able to get free treatment, Gray said.&lt;/p&gt;

Even though he has his kids 50% of the time, the parent who gets support (his ex) is supposed to cover all the normal kid expenses unless the divorce explicitly says otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In his case, OP and his ex are only supposed to split uninsured medical/dental issues and mutually agreed extracurriculars. OP said he provides child support and alimony, and noted that his ex doesn't work.

His ex emailed him to say that she can only afford the party if they split the cost. OP said his ex's ask feels off because it's not something he's obligated to split, and she's financially supported specifically so she can host these types of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While he said he wants his daughter to have a great birthday, he doesn't think he's supposed to fund things that aren't decreed in the divorce and said that this feels like a "transfer of wealth" if he pays. He asks if he's in the wrong for refusing to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stock image of a person holding a birthday cake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In his comments, people were mixed over whether or not OP was in the wrong. One person said that in the eyes of the court, OP is not in the wrong — but in the eyes of his daughter, he might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"[In] the eyes of the people don't know you personally and only know the details you have told us, you're NTA." they said. "In the eyes of your daughter who will only be told that you refused to help pay for the party yet you paid for her brother's party, that's a different story. Your ex has you between a rock and a hard place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another agreed with the first person, but said it was probably better to just pay for the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"NTA. However, your daughter doesn't deserve the consequences of this. I would agree to pay for the party and let your ex-wife know, in no uncertain terms, that it will never happen again," they said. "That if it does, rather than you paying her for half of the party, you will do the party yourself when you have your daughter. And the ex-wife will miss out on the experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A third said that everyone is in the wrong in this situation since the parents are involving the kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"[Everybody sucks here]. Divorce can be nasty. Especially if there’s a stay home parent involved. But your kids should never pay the price for that," one commenter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"By the sounds of things, your kids are older (paying car insurance means they are at least 16) and you only have a few years left of child support. You can nitpick and fight with your ex wife while your kids suffer the consequences and start to resent you," they continued. "Or you can suck it up for a few years till they’re adults. Given that you clearly aren’t suffering financially, this isn’t taking food off your table, just suck it up and pay it for your kids sake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/divorced-dads-ex-wants-him-to-split-cost-of-their-daughters-birthday-party-11867016" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life UK</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 19:24:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9fZnRxYXV2VVR0VUlzb3ZxMnhZdHA5N0s1aXpENWhFalVsZEFqMjl5Z0JsUGFBUDFYdXI2bzJKczNxYUhTMkJTRFVsU0NJV3RtV3lmREJHLURJQ3YxVTRzZGdSb0JoSUtqQ2tuWUxGMmk3cndf</guid></item><item><title>数百人在南卡罗来纳州被隔离，因为麻疹在美国两次爆发中蔓延-美联社新闻</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-south-carolina-utah-arizona-3bfc561ecc16d8e80175effdae0791d4</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="LeaderBoardAd-Mobile "&gt;

In two months, 111 people have been sickened by the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-vaccines-autism-measles-obesity-food-dye-f26089856550e978d28fd25b653d8103"&gt;vaccine-preventable virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 250 people, including students from nine area elementary, middle and high schools, are in quarantine — some for the second time since the outbreak began in October. Most of the state’s new cases stemmed from exposures at Way of Truth Church in Inman. Church leaders have been “very helpful,” said state epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are faced with ongoing transmission that we anticipate will go on for many more weeks, at least in our state,” said Bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Arizona and Utah, an outbreak has ballooned since &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.mohave.gov/news-notices/posts/measles-case-within-mohave-county-along-the-arizona-utah-border-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;August&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Mohave County, Arizona has logged 172 cases and the Southwest Utah Public Health Department has logged 82 cases. The border cities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, are the heaviest hit.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Utah has confirmed 115 measles cases this year. Arizona has confirmed 176.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nationally, the measles case count is nearing 2,000 for a disease that has been &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c"&gt;considered eliminated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the U.S. since 2000, a result of routine childhood vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/canada-loses-measles-elimination-status-1ac3a4bdc7546fac5d8e111bf5196e1e"&gt;Canada lost that designation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — which applies when there is no continuous local spread of the virus — as did the larger health region of the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Experts say the U.S. is also at risk of losing that status. For that to happen, measles would have to spread continuously for a year. A large outbreak in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-vaccine-outbreak-texas-mmr-0744a165cfb354022092a1f158c698b0"&gt;Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that started in January sickened nearly 900 and kicked off the United States’ worst measles year in more than three decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All but eight states have logged at least one measles case this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has confirmed 47 outbreaks this year, compared with 16 in 2024. Three people — &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-rfk-death-vaccine-4e28b0edf5cab47980b40b2d47f0ec50"&gt;two of them Texas school children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — have died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is already known about this topic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2024, CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months to provide additional protection against severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is added by this report?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During August 29, 2024–September 2, 2025, within a multisite network including nine states, vaccine effectiveness of 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccination was an estimated 76% against COVID-19–associated emergency department or urgent care (ED/UC) visits among immunocompetent children aged 9 months–4 years and an estimated 56% among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years, compared with those who did not receive a 2024–2025 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the implications for public health practice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a population with some persons having preexisting levels of protection from previous vaccination, previous infection, or both, 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccination provided children with additional protection against COVID-19–associated ED/UC encounters compared with no 2024–2025 vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="abstract" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Abstract"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During September 2023–August 2024, approximately 38,000 COVID-19–associated hospitalizations occurred among children and adolescents aged &amp;lt;18 years in the United States, a rate of approximately 53 per 100,000 children, ranging from 600 per 100,000 children aged &amp;lt;6 months to 21 per 100,000 children and adolescents aged 5–17 years. On June 27, 2024, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that all persons aged ≥6 months receive a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine, which targeted Omicron JN.1 and JN.1-derived sublineages. Investigators used a test-negative case-control design to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccines against COVID-19–associated emergency department or urgent care (ED/UC) visits during August 29, 2024–September 2, 2025, among immunocompetent children aged 9 months–4 years and children and adolescents aged 5–17 years in the CDC-funded Virtual SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and Other respiratory viruses Network (VISION), a multisite electronic health record–based network in nine states. Among children aged 9 months–4 years, VE against COVID-19–associated ED/UC visits was estimated at 76% (95% CI = 58%–87%) during the first 7–179 days after vaccination. Among children and adolescents aged 5&lt;b&gt;–&lt;/b&gt;17 years, VE against COVID-19–associated ED/UC visits was an estimated 56% (95% CI = 35%–70%) during the first 7–179 days after vaccination. These findings suggest that vaccination with a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose provided children with additional protection against COVID-19–associated ED/UC encounters compared with no 2024–2025 dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="introduction" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Introduction"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2020, COVID-19 has accounted for thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths in the United States each season, including approximately 38,000 hospitalizations among children and adolescents aged &amp;lt;18 years during September 2023–August 2024 (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;). During 2024, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron JN.1 and JN.1-derived lineages predominated and were genomically divergent from the XBB lineages on which the 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccines were based.* On June 27, 2024, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccines for persons aged ≥6 months (&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;); 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccines became available on August 22, 2024.&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; For previously unvaccinated immunocompetent children aged 6 months–4 years, a multidose initial series (including 3 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or 2 doses of Moderna vaccine) was recommended; a single 2024–2025 dose was recommended for those who completed an initial series. For immunocompetent children aged ≥5 years, a single 2024–2025 dose was recommended, regardless of vaccination history&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;). Per an announcement from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule was updated in May 2025 to indicate shared clinical decision-making&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt; for COVID-19 vaccination for healthy children and adolescents aged 6 months–17 years.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis estimated 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19–associated emergency department or urgent care (ED/UC) encounters in children aged 9 months–4 years and children and adolescents aged 5–17 years during August 29, 2024–September 2, 2025. Age 9 months rather than 6 months was the youngest age included to allow time for completion of the Pfizer-BioNTech initial series in children aged 6 months.&lt;sup&gt;††&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="methods" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Methods"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Data Source&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Virtual SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and Other respiratory viruses Network (VISION) is a multisite electronic health record (EHR)–based network including ED/UCs and hospitals in nine states used to estimate VE. Methods for VE analyses in both adult and pediatric populations within VISION have been described (&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;–&lt;i&gt;6&lt;/i&gt;). In VISION VE analyses, eligible encounters at participating health care systems are those among patients who have received molecular testing (e.g., real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction) or antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 during the 10 days before or ≤72 hours after an eligible ED/UC encounter or hospital admission for COVID-19–like illness.&lt;sup&gt;§§&lt;/sup&gt; This analysis included encounters among eligible immunocompetent children and adolescents aged 9 months–17 years who visited a participating ED/UC during August 29, 2024–September 2, 2025. COVID-19 vaccination history is ascertained from state or jurisdictional registries, EHRs, and, in a subset of sites, medical claims data.&lt;sup&gt;¶¶&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Data Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eligible encounters from seven participating health care systems, including 256 ED/UCs, during August 29, 2024–September 2, 2025, were included. Case-patients were those with an ED/UC encounter for COVID-19–like illness and receipt of a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular or antigen test result; control patients were those with an ED/UC encounter for COVID-19–like illness and receipt of a negative SARS-CoV-2 molecular test result.***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children were excluded from analyses if they received a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose &amp;lt;7 days before their index date&lt;sup&gt;†††&lt;/sup&gt; or received a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose &amp;lt;2 months after receiving any previous COVID-19 vaccine dose, unless part of an initial series. COVID-19 case-patients were also excluded if they received a positive test result for influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus at the time of their SARS-CoV-2 ED/UC encounter. To reduce bias from overlapping vaccination patterns, control patients who received a positive or indeterminant influenza test result were excluded from the primary analysis (&lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt;). Previous SARS-CoV-2 infections are incompletely documented in medical records; therefore, children were included regardless of previous SARS-CoV-2 infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary VE analyses were conducted by age groups 9 months–4 years and 5–17 years due to differences in the recommended COVID-19 vaccination schedule. In primary VE analyses, children aged 9 months–4 years were considered vaccinated if they completed an initial series with at least 1 2024–2025 dose as part of that series or completed an initial series and then received a 2024–2025 dose as an additional vaccine. The 9 months–4 years comparator group comprised children who had completed the initial COVID-19 vaccine series but had not received a 2024–2025 dose or had no recorded COVID-19 vaccination. Children aged 9 months–4 years with an incomplete initial series were excluded from the primary analysis to assess the ACIP-recommended schedule for this age group. A sensitivity analysis among children aged 9 months–4 years compared children who received at least 1 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose with children who did not, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination history. Among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years, primary VE analyses compared those who received a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose with those who did not, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination history. Results were also stratified by age groups of 5–11 years and 12–17 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were estimated using multivariable logistic regression, comparing persons who received a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose with those who did not among case-patients and control patients, as described in this report. Models were adjusted a priori for age in years, race and ethnicity, sex, calendar day (days since August 29, 2024, to account for variability in COVID-19 circulation), and geographic region with age and calendar day included as natural splines.&lt;sup&gt;§§§&lt;/sup&gt; VE was calculated as (1 − adjusted OR) x 100% during the first 7–179 days since receipt of the most recent 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose. Sensitivity analyses in both the 9 months–4 years and 5–17 years age groups examined VE during the 7–299 days since receipt of a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.3.2; R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.&lt;sup&gt;¶¶¶&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="results" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Results"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;2024–2025 COVID-19 VE Against COVID-19–Associated ED/UC Visits in Children Aged 9 Months–4 Years&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among children aged 9 months–4 years, 44,541 ED/UC encounters met criteria for inclusion in the analyses, including 1,292 (3%) case-patients and 43,249 (97%) control patients (&lt;a id="T1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T1_down"&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt;). Twelve (&amp;lt;1%) case-patients and 1,847 (4%) control patients had received a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose. Effectiveness of a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccination against a COVID-19–associated ED/UC visit was 76% (95% CI = 58%–87%) during the first 7–179 days after vaccination and 77% (95% CI = 62%–86%) during the first 7–299 days after vaccination (&lt;a id="T2_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T2_down"&gt;Table 2&lt;/a&gt;). VE point estimates were lower at 66% when the comparator group was expanded to include children with an incomplete initial COVID-19 vaccination series, but CIs overlapped with those in the primary analysis (95% CI = 51%–76%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;2024–2025 COVID-19 VE Against COVID-19–Associated ED/UC Visits in Children and Adolescents Aged 5–17 Years&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years, 53,467 ED/UC encounters met criteria for inclusion in the analyses, including 1,325 (2%) case-patients and 52,142 (98%) control patients (Table 1). Twenty-six (2%) case-patients and 2,462 (5%) control patients had received a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose. Effectiveness of a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccination against a COVID-19–associated ED/UC visit was 56% (95% CI = 35%–70%) during the first 7–179 days after vaccination, and 45% (95% CI = 25%–59%) during the first 7–299 days after vaccination (&lt;a id="T3_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T3_down"&gt;Table 3&lt;/a&gt;). Results were similar when stratified by age (51% among children aged 5–11 years and 61% among children and adolescents aged 12–17 years, with overlapping CIs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="discussion" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Discussion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccines provided protection against COVID-19–associated ED/UC encounters among children and adolescents aged 9 months–17 years. This evaluation included children and adolescents with varied COVID-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection histories, and therefore, results should be interpreted as estimates of the additional protection provided by a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine in a population with mixed preexisting immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infants aged 6–11 months have the highest rates of COVID-19–associated hospitalization of any COVID-19 vaccine–eligible pediatric age group, and COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates in the United States during the 2024–25 respiratory virus season were higher in this group than all adult age groups other than those aged ≥65 years (&lt;i&gt;8&lt;/i&gt;), underscoring potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination in eligible infants. In this analysis, VE was highest in children aged 9 months–4 years, although CIs overlapped with older age groups. The apparent higher VE in younger children might be due to lower rates of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.**** The primary estimates for VE in this analysis were similar to or higher than 2024–2025 VE estimates for adults in the United States (&lt;i&gt;9&lt;/i&gt;); estimates were also similar to or higher than those for 2023–2024 in children (35% [95% CI = 16%–49%] for children aged 9 months–4 years and 44% [95% CI = 29%–55%] for children and adolescents aged 5–17 years) (&lt;i&gt;6&lt;/i&gt;). Higher estimates for the 2024–25 season might be due to different patterns of recent previous SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the 2023–24 season or might be due to fewer changes in circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants during the 2024–25 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination based on shared clinical decision-making is individually based and guided by a decision process between the health care provider and the patient or parent/guardian; generally, ACIP recommendations adopted by CDC and listed on CDC immunization schedules, including those based on shared clinical decision-making, are covered by health insurance plans. The impact that shifting from universal to shared clinical decision-making (otherwise known as individual-based decision-making) will have on COVID-19 vaccination coverage or effectiveness in children is unclear, underscoring the importance of continued monitoring of COVID-19 VE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, although case-patients met a COVID-19–like illness definition and received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, they might have visited ED/UCs for reasons other than COVID-19, potentially lowering VE estimates. Second, misclassification of vaccination status was possible, which would likely result in underestimation of VE if the misclassification was nondifferential. Previous estimates across networks including various COVID-19 vaccine history ascertainment methods (i.e., EHR, immunization information systems, self-report, and claims data) have yielded similar VE estimates (&lt;i&gt;9&lt;/i&gt;). Third, children aged 9 months–4 years and children and adolescents aged 5–17 years account for a smaller fraction of the general population than adults in age groups frequently examined in VE analyses (i.e., 18–64 years and ≥65 years), decreasing the sample size available for estimating VE in children and adolescents compared with adults. In addition, because of relatively low COVID-19 vaccination coverage in children compared with adults and overall lower rates of medically attended COVID-19 during 2024–2025 compared with 2023–2024, this study did not have sufficient statistical power to measure VE by finer intervals of time since dose and for hospitalization. Fourth, although analyses were adjusted for some relevant confounders, residual confounding from other factors, such as behavioral modifications to prevent SARS-CoV-2 exposure and outpatient antiviral treatment for COVID-19, might remain. Finally, low COVID-19 vaccination coverage among children and adolescents might reduce the generalizability of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Implications for Public Health Practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this analysis, receipt of a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose provided additional protection against COVID-19–associated ED/UC visits among children and adolescents aged 9 months–17 years in a population with preexisting levels of protection from previous vaccination, previous infection, or both. CDC continues to monitor VE of COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

He figured it was because he was holding a kitten, according to the report, which does not identify the man or where he resided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He fought off the skunk, rendering it unconscious, and walked away with a scratch on his shin that bled. But he didn’t think he’d been bitten, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, the man started experiencing hallucinations. He also had a stiff neck, confusion and difficulty swallowing and walking. Two days after his symptoms appeared, he was found unresponsive at home. He was resuscitated and taken to a hospital, but he never regained consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five days in a hospital, he was declared brain dead and removed from life support. His left kidney, heart, lungs and both corneas were recovered for donation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His kidney went to a man from Michigan, who received the transplant at a hospital in Ohio. Five weeks later, the man started experiencing tremors, confusion, urinary incontinence and weakness in his legs. He was hospitalized with fever, difficulty swallowing and an extreme fear of water. Clinicians suspected he had rabies, and several samples were sent to the CDC for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a week at the hospital, the Michigan man died. Local public health officials interviewed his family, who reported that he had not been exposed to any animals. But the testing showed evidence of rabies in his saliva, skin and brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when the CDC, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and an Idaho public health district began investigating the donor as the source. Health officials tested the Idaho man’s right kidney, which had not been donated, and detected a rabies variant linked to silver-haired bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, three other patients, one each from Idaho, California and New Mexico, received ocular grafts prepared from the Idaho man’s recovered corneas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As officials investigated the donor’s rabies status, the cornea recipients had their grafts removed as a precaution and received post-exposure prophylaxis, a medication taken after potential exposure to rabies to prevent infection. Rabies is almost always fatal without that medication, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cornea recipients remained asymptomatic. Another corneal graft transplant planned for a Missouri patient was canceled. Later, the CDC detected rabies in one of the previously implanted grafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is excluded from routine donor pathogen testing in the U.S. because of its rarity in humans and the complexity of diagnostic testing, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7439a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, hospital staff who treated the Idaho man were initially unaware of the skunk scratch and attributed his symptoms to chronic comorbidities. After rabies was suspected in the Michigan man, a biopsy that had previously been collected from the donor on his third day at the hospital was revisited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare did not immediately respond to a request for details about the Idaho man, including where he lived in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Epidemiologist Dr. Christine Hahn co-authored the CDC report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;________&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What a joke; I could barely walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once inside, I slumped into an oversized chair and wearily told my new therapist, Elizabeth, my problem was that I sucked at life and the visit would be a waste of time for both of us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only reason I was there was because one of my adult daughters had threatened to call 911 if I didn’t get help for myself. She’d become alarmed after she couldn’t reach me and had stopped by my house, where she discovered me flat on my back on my sofa. I hadn’t bathed or changed my clothes in weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming Elizabeth would show me the door so she could move on to a more worthwhile patient, I was surprised when she instead asked me to elaborate. After listening for nearly an hour, she said, “What you’re suffering from has nothing to do with being bad at life. It’s called resilience fatigue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d never heard of it, but I knew all about resilience. Its necessity had been drummed into my head since I was a kid. “Pull yourself up by your bootstraps ....” “When the going gets tough ....” “If at first you don’t succeed ....” As I saw it, resilience was the crux of my problem. If I wasn’t so weak and lazy, I could allow adversity to transform me into a deeper, tougher individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a lot of work to do,” Elizabeth told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Psychological Association &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/resilience" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="defines resilience" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="693af50fe4b0cfabad28fa40" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.apa.org/topics/resilience" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;defines resilience&lt;/a&gt; as “the process and outcome of successfully adapting to difficult or challenging life experiences.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adapting” is the key word. If stressful events never let up, there’s no time to adapt. Resilience fatigue or toxic stress is about prolonged, excessive and unmanaged intense stress that leads to a sense of being constantly overwhelmed. Without sufficient coping mechanisms, the body’s stress response becomes overworked. This, in turn, can lead to an imbalance in our physiological systems and affect everything from mood to the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d been living in a near-constant state of anxiety mixed with dread since April 2000. I’d grown so accustomed to the feeling of impending doom — the racing heart, the perpetual tightness across my shoulders — that I thought it was normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith’s death would have been challenging enough on its own, but overnight I also became a single mother of three. Worse still, I was pregnant with our fourth child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that was just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and Keith on their wedding day, March 4, 1989.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith had minimal life insurance. I’d been a stay-at-home mother for almost a decade while we continually moved for his job as he climbed the corporate ladder. Even before I buried him, the realization that I’d have to find both work and child care ASAP filled me with terror. A family of five had to have health insurance. We’d been insured through Keith’s employer, and I couldn’t afford to pay for it outright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding work took precedence over everything, including grieving my husband and bonding with the baby born three weeks after he died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d always assumed the capacity for resilience was limitless and also hardwired into human beings like the fight-or-flight response, but during my counseling sessions, I learned otherwise. It’s not innate; rather, it’s learned and comes not just from individual effort but also from available support and resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The times I attempted to discuss my fears or concerns with others, they dismissed them: “You’re young, you’ll bounce back ....” “God never gives you more than you can handle ....” “In a few years you’ll remarry and hopefully the next guy will be rich ....” This was what passed for support in my world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, I believed grit and determination would not only save me but someday I’d look back on those terrible days and be thankful for what I’d gone through while reflecting on how far I’d come. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a hot minute, that seemed to be the case. After an obsessive job search, I found a position in an auto insurance call center with top-notch benefits. My parents, who’d recently retired and had moved nearby, agreed to watch my kids and not charge me. I began humming the song “I Will Survive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the job turned into a trap. Callers were frequently angry; they swore and shouted at me all day. There was little room for advancement unless I could put in overtime or travel, which was impossible given my situation. I’d leave work depressed and drained and come home to a messy house full of bickering kids and memories of the life I used to love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also began flashing back to the morning I found Keith dead in our bed. As time passed, I thought about him more instead of less, and I couldn’t understand why the last day of his life played on a constant loop in my head, as if I could change the outcome if I relived it enough times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I mentioned this to a relative, she chastised me. “You need to focus on all the good things you still have, not on the bad.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course I was grateful for what I had, despite the fact that my finances were eroding at a frighteningly rapid pace. Despite the fact that I’d gone from enjoying a vibrant, hope-filled life with a man I loved to living like a cloistered nun. Despite the fact that one day my future had beckoned like the yellow brick road and the next there was a ROAD PERMANENTLY CLOSED sign blocking the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author's family on their last family vacation in 1999. "Keith had less than a year to live," the author writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of all I was grateful for my parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their mid-60s, they were now practically raising a toddler and an infant. I was tired all the time and so were they. Our relationship deteriorated even as I suffered crushing guilt over what they were doing for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet I was certain I could turn everything around. So I prayed daily for acceptance of my situation. “The Secret” became my Bible, and I spewed positive affirmations morning, noon and night. I tried to banish negative thoughts from my head and focus on future abundance, not what I’d lost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing changed. Eventually I went through bankruptcy followed by foreclosure. I was fired from my job for not being able to keep up with the ever-changing metrics. When I discovered my oldest daughter was using heroin, I thought life could not get any worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My father developed Alzheimer’s disease, and I moved in with my parents to help care for him. Two years after he died, my mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and I took care of her until the end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;By then my daughter was no longer using heroin, which was an unexpected miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at that point my younger daughter was in trouble for school truancy and drug use. Eventually she was removed from my home by Franklin County Children Services after her high school filed a criminal complaint with the local juvenile court and a judge ruled that she be placed in foster care at a local psychiatric residential treatment facility. It was a good thing I was unemployed, as my days became a merry-go-round of mandatory meetings with social workers, psychiatrists, counselors and a court-appointed guardian. They picked apart my life and told me everything I was doing wrong as a parent but offered nothing in terms of concrete solutions or support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My daughter was gone for over two years. Upon her return, she told me she’d been sexually assaulted while she was at the treatment facility. Guilt for what she’d been through vied with an impotent sense of rage deep inside me. The feelings were so inflammatory that sometimes I was sure I’d self-combust. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the midst of my ongoing crises, I met a man in a writers’ group I’d joined in an attempt to get away from my life. Jim became a bright beacon in my otherwise dreary existence, so much so that I dared to envision a future with him. But three months after my mother passed, he died by suicide in my car. My younger son, who’d adored Jim, was so traumatized he had to be hospitalized after he became suicidal. My older son ghosted me for several years, deeming me a toxic mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could no longer deny that my life had become a not-so-funny running joke, with me as the punchline. Sometimes I imagined my husband disgustedly shaking his head as he watched his family fall apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just thinking about it exhausted me. One day I lay down on my living room sofa and couldn’t find the strength to rise again. I prayed for death as I thought about how I’d failed everyone, including myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth helped me to reframe my viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your husband died, then you had a baby. You had to hit the ground running with no time to grieve him or help your children. Your life became a runaway train that took 17 years to crash,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She put me in touch with a psychiatric nurse who prescribed a combination of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications. She also utilized cognitive therapy, including EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing). Slowly I began to feel better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and her youngest daughter, Dianna. "She was born three weeks after her father died," the author writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course you can’t always control what life throws at you, but Elizabeth pointed out that my path might have taken a different turn if I hadn’t been forced into a race against time to secure health insurance and child care, those fickle twins that dictate life for so many Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, I had trouble letting go of the conviction that I’d traded in resilience for lethargy. All my life I’d heard that adversity builds character and that what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elizabeth shook her head. “Those are dangerous generalizations and they’re mostly false. Beliefs like that allow us to minimize other peoples’ suffering without feeling guilt.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A growing body of research shows that despite the widespread belief that negative life events result in “post-traumatic growth” or positive personality change, “the only type of growth that seems to arise consistently is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://spsp.org/news-center/character-context-blog/does-adversity-really-make-us-stronger-usually-not#:~:text=The%20only%20type%20of%20growth,intimate%2C%20meaningful%2C%20and%20rewarding." role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="deepened relationships" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="693af50fe4b0cfabad28fa40" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://spsp.org/news-center/character-context-blog/does-adversity-really-make-us-stronger-usually-not#:~:text=The%20only%20type%20of%20growth,intimate%2C%20meaningful%2C%20and%20rewarding." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;deepened relationships&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” according to the Society for Personality and Social Psychology&lt;span&gt;. Our relationships with loved ones often become more meaningful during times of struggle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“But that requires having supportive relationships in the first place,” Elizabeth said. “Other than your parents, who were tossed out of the frying pan into the fire with you, you’ve been going it alone all this time. What would you say to that relative who told you Keith’s death would make you stronger if you saw her today?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I didn’t hesitate. “I’d say, ‘You have no idea how badly I wish you’d been right.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Seven years on, my own mental health is in a much better place, and my children are thriving. We’re closer than we’ve ever been, and all four are involved in healthy relationships and working at jobs they enjoy. My older daughter became a psychiatric nurse and the younger one is pursuing a nursing degree in the same field. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After my oldest child went through a divorce a few years ago, I began watching my two young grandchildren while she worked, paying it forward the way my parents did for me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I understand the urge to offer platitudes to someone who’s experienced a loss or tragedy. The right words can be difficult to find. But it’s better to say nothing than to imply they’ll somehow benefit or be improved as a result of their misfortune.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Suffering hasn’t made me stronger, but it certainly has taught me about the kind of person I want to be. Now I’m able to offer more than platitudes to others going through difficult times because I can share my experience along with empathy.

(Although the participants were screened for GAD symptoms, none were officially diagnosed as part of this study.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 53% of the cohort, or 32 students, reported not getting enough sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers took blood samples from the participants and surveyed the levels of various immune cells, which revealed that those who experienced anxiety-like symptoms had 38% fewer NK cells than those without symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-kaJVcSiLi7WbgjmFw6dAi9" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-kaJVcSiLi7WbgjmFw6dAi9 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;NK cells are one of the first types of immune cells to respond to an infection or to the presence of cancer in the body, and immunologists split them into &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/1521-4141%282001010%2931%3A10%3C3121%3A%3AAID-IMMU3121%3E3.0.CO%3B2-4" target="_blank" data-url="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/1521-4141%282001010%2931%3A10%3C3121%3A%3AAID-IMMU3121%3E3.0.CO%3B2-4" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;two subsets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

For example, it could be that the cells die off or that the body renews them at a slower rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, "focusing on circulating NK cells [in the blood] does not allow investigation of NK cells infiltrating the nervous system," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://research.uniroma1.it/researcher/77125e1825c2ca0e1a09375a2d70eaf47decbdae4188f85dc9720160" target="_blank" data-url="https://research.uniroma1.it/researcher/77125e1825c2ca0e1a09375a2d70eaf47decbdae4188f85dc9720160" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stefano Garofalo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an immunologist at the Sapienza University of Rome who was not involved with the work, told Live Science in an email. He speculated that the drop in NK cells could happen if they migrate from the bloodstream into nerve tissue in people who have anxiety or insomnia. His research focuses on how &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_7628259092702800266&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-023-38899-3&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fimmune-system%2Finsomnia-and-anxiety-come-with-a-weaker-immune-system-a-new-study-starts-to-unravel-why" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38899-3" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-023-38899-3&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fimmune-system%2Finsomnia-and-anxiety-come-with-a-weaker-immune-system-a-new-study-starts-to-unravel-why" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NK cells help regulate brain function&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and shape behavior in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are consistent with those from other research, such as a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.871822/full" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.871822/full" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study on chronic tinnitus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, wherein participants who reported higher stress levels had fewer cell-killing NK cells. Alhamawi said that the stress hormone cortisol may drive down NK cell populations because it is known to exert other immune-suppressing effects. For instance, cortisol can hinder antigen-specific T cells, a type of immune cell that recognizes features of specific threats, like viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anxiety increases the level of cortisol, so we think it might affect the number of NK cells in an indirect way," Alhamawi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="a0c9f380-d630-4618-9c15-bca44eff94cc"&gt;The current research has a few caveats. "The main limitation of the study is the very small participant group, consisting exclusively of women under 25 years of age and belonging to a single ethnic background," Garofalo said. Future studies could determine if the correlation is more generalizable, using a larger mixed-sex population of individuals from different backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alhamawi noted that she would like to perform a long-term study, in which researchers track how anxiety, sleeping patterns and NK cell levels change over time in the same cohort of participants. That could provide a clearer picture of the relationship between these psychological factors and immunity, as well as the incidence of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can see if there is [an] effect by testing if they develop more infectious disease or chronic disease," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="4f95a3fc-0609-4ea1-9683-9be4a9a2e718"&gt;

The results of that poll will be be announced on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer accused the BMA of being "irresponsible" and said it should accept the offer on the table, adding the offer can only go forward if they stop strike action "particularly in the run-up to Christmas, particularly when we've got a problem with flu." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Daniel Elkeles, of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said: "The NHS is in the thick of a storm come early. Flu is hitting hard and other winter bugs are surging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Now more than ever, the NHS needs all hands on deck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We have to hope that BMA resident doctors will step back from next week's strike, take up the government's sensible offer and end their damaging dispute."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Buckling system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), which takes into account levels of infection in the community as well as hospitals, shows infection rates are continuing to rise, but not as sharply as they were in the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But officials stressed it was too early to take that as a sign that flu could be peaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;They said the virus was unpredictable and a lull could be followed by another surge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Conall Watson, an infectious diseases expert at the UKHSA, urged people who are eligible for a free flu vaccine on the NHS, which includes the over 65s, those with certain health conditions and pregnant women, to still come forward if they had not yet got one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There is still plenty of flu vaccine available to protect those who need it – what's running out is time to be protected ahead of Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"If you are eligible this is the last chance to get protected as we head into Christmas – so make an appointment with the NHS today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It can take up to two weeks following vaccination to develop the fullest protection from the jab, Dr Watson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Vicky Price, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said winter viruses were placing further strain on an "already buckling system".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She said patients were facing long waits in A&amp;amp;E as hospital staff were being overloaded with patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But she accused NHS England and the government of using it as a "convenient scapegoat" for the "predictable breakdown" in NHS capacity caused by workforce shortages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The situation in emergency departments has become so dire that what was once considered a critical incident is now seen as normal and routine.

        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;New analysis from a WHO global expert committee on vaccine safety has found that, based on available evidence, no causal link exists between vaccines and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The conclusion reaffirms WHO’s position that childhood vaccines do not cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS), established in 1999, brings together international experts to provide independent and authoritative scientific advice to WHO on global vaccine safety related priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest analysis, discussed by the Committee on 27 November 2025, focused first on the relationship between thiomersal-containing vaccines and ASD, and the association between vaccines in general and ASD. Evidence based on 31 primary research studies, published between January 2010 and August 2025, including data from multiple countries, strongly supports the positive safety profile of vaccines used during childhood and pregnancy, and confirms the absence of a causal link with ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Committee also assessed the review of potential health risks associated with vaccines with aluminum adjuvants, drawing on studies conducted from 1999 through March 2023. In addition, it reviewed a recent large cohort study analyzing nationwide registry data of children born in Denmark between 1997 and 2018. In summary, the available high-quality evidence shows no association between the trace amounts of aluminum used in some vaccines and ASD, supporting the ongoing use of vaccines with aluminum adjuvants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following its review, GACVS reaffirms its previous conclusions from 2002, 2004 and 2012: vaccines, including those with thiomersal and/or aluminum, do not cause autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO advises all national authorities to rely on the latest science and ensure vaccine policies are grounded in the strongest available evidence. Global childhood immunization efforts represent one of the greatest achievements in improving lives, livelihoods and the prosperity of societies. During the past 50 years, childhood immunization has saved at least 154 million lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
