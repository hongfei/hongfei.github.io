Talking about this, Dr. Sudhanshu Rai- Metabolic doctor and Sports Physio- revealed the 10 early signs of high blood sugar and insulin resistance one must notice before it’s too late. "Awareness is the first step— listen to your body and take action early," he wrote in the post.

Dr. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sudhir-kumar" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Sudhir Kumar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a neurologist from Hyderabad, experienced this struggle firsthand when his weight reached 100 kilograms. However, through steady, practical lifestyle changes, he managed to shed 30 kilograms over two years — a transformation that not only changed his physical appearance but also his overall health and confidence. Dr. Kumar’s journey, shared openly on social media, offers valuable insights and inspiration for anyone hoping to make lasting changes without resorting to extreme diets or grueling exercise routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dr. Kumar’s &lt;keyword id="4470428" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fitness-journey" source="Orion"&gt;fitness journey&lt;/keyword&gt;: Overcoming &lt;keyword id="28749874" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="weight-struggles" source="Orion"&gt;weight struggles&lt;/keyword&gt; amid a busy schedule revealed&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before starting his fitness journey in late 2020, Dr. Kumar found himself trapped in a cycle that many people struggling with weight can relate to. His work as a neurologist demanded 16 to 17-hour days, leaving very little time for self-care. The long hours meant he often slept just 4 to 5 hours a night, which severely impacted his energy levels and metabolism. On top of this, his diet was far from ideal — frequent overeating, regular consumption of junk food, sugary snacks, and soft drinks added fuel to the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physically, the consequences were evident. Walking even five kilometers was a major challenge for him, and he experienced difficulty with stamina and endurance. It was clear that drastic changes were needed, but they had to fit into the reality of a busy medical professional’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How limiting work hours enabled Dr. Kumar to focus on &lt;keyword id="865258" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fitness-and-nutrition" source="Orion"&gt;fitness and nutrition&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important changes Dr. Kumar made was to significantly reduce his working hours. By limiting his workday to 8-9 hours, he was able to reclaim precious time to focus on his health and well-being. This shift was crucial because it not only reduced stress but also allowed him to prioritize exercise and proper meal preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people underestimate the impact of work-life balance on health. Dr. Kumar’s example highlights how setting boundaries around work can directly contribute to better physical and mental wellness, making it easier to adopt and maintain healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How better sleep helped Dr. Kumar regulate appetite and boost metabolism&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another cornerstone of Dr. Kumar’s transformation was improving his sleep quality. Increasing his nightly sleep to 7-8 hours was a game changer. Sleep plays a vital role in regulating the hormones that control hunger and fullness. Without adequate rest, the body tends to produce more ghrelin (which increases appetite) and less leptin (which signals fullness), making it harder to avoid overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, sleep supports metabolic health, aids muscle recovery, and boosts mental clarity — all of which are essential for maintaining an active lifestyle and making good dietary choices. By prioritizing sleep, Dr. Kumar laid a solid foundation for sustainable weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How cutting refined carbs and increasing protein aids lasting weight loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to nutrition, Dr. Kumar took a balanced and realistic approach. He stopped drinking soft drinks altogether and cut down drastically on junk food and sugary treats, which are often major contributors to unwanted weight gain. Instead of following a fad diet, he focused on reducing his carbohydrate intake — especially refined carbs — while increasing the amount of protein he consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is known to help keep you feeling full longer and helps preserve muscle mass during weight loss. This thoughtful adjustment in his diet allowed Dr. Kumar to shed pounds without feeling deprived or hungry, making the changes sustainable over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How consistent running helped him lose weight and improve his health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kumar didn’t rush into intense exercise. He started slow, walking five kilometers even though it was difficult at first. Over the course of several weeks, he gradually increased his distance to 10 kilometers, building endurance at a comfortable pace. Eventually, he transitioned into slow jogging and then running, focusing more on how long he stayed active rather than how fast he went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach helped him avoid injury and burnout. Later, in December 2022, he added strength training sessions three times a week, which helped build muscle, improve metabolism, and further enhance his body composition. The combination of aerobic activity and resistance training proved to be a winning formula for his sustained weight loss. Over time, Dr. Kumar’s dedication to running became apparent through the impressive distances he covered. In 2021, he averaged 15 kilometers per day, completed 339 runs of 10 kilometers or more, ran 69 half marathons, and even completed a full marathon. The following year, while slightly reducing his daily average to 12.6 kilometers, he still managed 304 runs of 10 kilometers or more, along with 43 half marathons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physical transformation was impressive, but Dr. Kumar experienced benefits far beyond the number on the scale. Losing 30 kilograms brought a remarkable increase in energy and stamina. He reported feeling more focused and productive in both his professional and personal life. Alongside these changes, his self-confidence soared, reflecting the powerful impact of improved health on mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical tests showed improvements across the board. His resting heart rate dropped from 72 to an impressively low 40-42 beats per minute, indicating better cardiovascular fitness. Key health markers such as blood sugar levels (HbA1C), cholesterol, and blood pressure all improved, lowering his risk for chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practical tips from Dr. Kumar’s &lt;keyword id="2835833" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="weight-loss-journey" source="Orion"&gt;weight loss journey&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on his experience, Dr. Kumar stresses the importance of consistency. Showing up to exercise regularly matters more than pushing yourself to run faster or harder every day. He encourages people to focus on enjoying the activity and listening to their bodies instead of chasing personal bests or competing with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also highlights the value of cross-training — incorporating various forms of exercise to keep workouts interesting and reduce injury risk. Diet-wise, he advises mindful eating, suggesting that reducing overall calorie intake and possibly experimenting with time-restricted eating can be beneficial, though it should be tailored to individual needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, he underlines the non-negotiable role of good sleep in any fitness journey, reminding us that 7-8 hours per night is essential for optimal results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The information shared in this article is based on Dr. Sudhir Kumar’s personal health journey and is intended for informational and inspirational purposes only.

And managing those family bonds required more brainpower, which may have led to greater intelligence and teamwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some other animals couple up in similar ways to humans, most don’t, so love may be one of the missing links that helped us evolve from apes to us. But in order to persuade our less-evolved ancestors to share responsibilities (and food) with another person, love had to have some pretty huge benefits — like the nine listed here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If two people are truly in love, they'll unlock these pretty awesome health perks:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

And here’s a great one: doing so will boost your energy, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-08-physical-psychological-power.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors tested participants’ blood glucose levels before and after they thought about their partners and found that they experienced a boost at 10 and 25 minutes after.

But when you’re ready to get back to it, your significant other can help you do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Couples who diet or exercise together have a better chance at long-term success than those who go it alone, according to a study from &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2091401" rel="nofollow"&gt;University College London&lt;/a&gt;. It makes sense, right? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, it’s harder to clean up your diet when your guy is chowing down on all your old favorites in front of you.

Being in a loving relationship typically means having someone who encourages healthy behaviors, notices when something's wrong with your health, and provides crucial stress-relief during difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/know-you-found-your-soulmate"&gt;10 Signs From The Universe You've Met Your Soulmate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5.

Today, about 57 million people live with dementia worldwide, and Alzheimer’s disease causes most cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors rely on interviews, brief cognitive checks, and brain scans when available. A clinically available blood test now offers another option that is simple, fast, and accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-flagging-alzheimer-s-in-blood"&gt;Flagging Alzheimer’s in blood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team was led by Sebastian Palmqvist at &lt;a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lund University&lt;/a&gt; in Sweden. Their goal was clear: make an accurate &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-blood-test-can-track-the-progression-of-alzheimers/"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt; that a regular clinic can use to flag Alzheimer’s biology in people with memory concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a prospective study of 1,213 patients seen in both family practices and specialty memory clinics, a serum panel correctly identified Alzheimer’s pathology about 88 to 92 percent of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That performance was on par with the accuracy seen when samples were analyzed in batches or as they arrived, which matches how clinics actually work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test looks for a specific biomarker in plasma called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10066514/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;phosphorylated tau 217&lt;/a&gt;, often shortened to p-tau217. It also reads the ratio of amyloid beta 42 to amyloid beta 40, two forms of a protein linked to plaques in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These measurements rise or fall in characteristic ways when &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/this-simple-nighttime-sleep-habit-could-delay-or-prevent-alzheimers-in-all-adults/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; pathology is present. By combining them, the test gives a single probability score that tracks the biology behind memory loss, not just the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-help-for-primary-care-doctors"&gt;Help for primary care doctors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Primary care doctors’ accuracy in identifying Alzheimer’s disease was 61 per cent, while specialist physicians were correct 73 per cent of the time,” added &lt;a href="https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/sebastian-palmqvist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sebastian Palmqvist&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Professor of Neurology at Lund University and consultant at &lt;a href="https://vard.skane.se/psykiatri-skane/mottagningar-och-avdelningar/akutmottagning-barn--och-ungdomspsykiatri/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Skåne&lt;/a&gt; University Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team compared the test’s performance with doctors’ best clinical judgment before any biomarker results were known and those numbers show why an easy lab test can help the first clinicians who see most patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier and more accurate classification steers people to the right next step. It also reduces unnecessary referrals for expensive imaging when the blood test rules out Alzheimer’s biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-aps2-score"&gt;Inside the APS2 score&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab algorithm, sometimes called APS2, blends the p-tau217 percentage with the amyloid ratio to estimate the chance of amyloid positivity in the brain. Ratios help account for unrelated medical factors that can nudge a single marker up or down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02869-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that percent p-tau217 in blood closely matches the clinical performance of Food and Drug Administration (&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;) cleared cerebrospinal fluid tests for detecting Alzheimer’s pathology. Accuracy climbs even higher when labs use two cutoff values, one to rule in and one to rule out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians will still need other information in some cases. A subgroup will land in an intermediate zone, which is a cue to order a PET scan or repeat testing rather than guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-this-fits-with-current-treatments"&gt;How this fits with current treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatments that target amyloid require proof of amyloid biology before they start. The FDA granted traditional approval for &lt;em&gt;lecanemab&lt;/em&gt;, marketed as &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-converts-novel-alzheimers-disease-treatment-traditional-approval" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leqembi&lt;/a&gt;, for early symptomatic Alzheimer’s treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency also approved &lt;em&gt;donanemab&lt;/em&gt;, now sold as &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-approves-treatment-adults-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kisunla&lt;/a&gt;, for adults with early symptoms and confirmed amyloid pathology. As access to these drugs grows, fast triage in regular clinics becomes more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The test is already available in the USA and is likely to become available in many other countries soon. Initially, it will mainly be used in specialist memory clinics, and it may take approximately one to two years to implement guidelines and training in primary care,” concluded &lt;a href="https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/oskar-hansson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oskar Hansson&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Neurology at Lund University and senior consultant at Skåne University Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blood draw in a familiar clinic setting lowers the barrier for people who cannot travel far or wait long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alzheimer-s-blood-and-healthcare"&gt;Alzheimer’s, blood, and healthcare&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A routine blood test is less invasive than a cerebrospinal fluid tap and easier to schedule than advanced imaging. Results can arrive quickly, which helps families move from uncertainty to a clear plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An accurate negative result can spare people from months of worry and unnecessary tests. A positive result, combined with a clinical assessment, helps providers arrange the right counseling, safety steps, and referrals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This test does not replace a full evaluation. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brains-quiet-moments-may-shape-memory-and-fight-alzheimers/"&gt;Memory&lt;/a&gt; changes can come from depression, sleep problems, medications, or other neurological diseases, so clinicians still need to take a careful history and examine the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No test is perfect. A small fraction of results will fall between the lower and upper cutoffs, and that gray zone is best handled with follow up testing or specialty referral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local policies will shape how primary clinics use the assay alongside cognitive exams and imaging. Training and clear workflows will help teams decide when to test, how to interpret results, and when to refer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will keep studying how comorbid conditions, age, and disease stage affect performance. Automated platforms and standardized reporting should make it easier for labs to deliver consistent results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2821669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 17:16:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNUzhac0pPbDc1X28tMXRJQndSd3RHaE9hS0lQQ05LWDBRN1hMOHhLLTFiU3loTHMyMGxwOENzTDA1SVRoVVR6dGJJMnJfN0xtWXBtNGtEbjhFQTM5RDR3Y2d0T1ZCeHdGRmNxQTNJWXdpZWpkNkxaMGFub1J2NGhiOG9qdkgwSlR4aHF4anlyQlVONXpPdjVLZ0NhMUZlNVdEdEZkY0U0Um9tcWdIRlRyZUNPTQ</guid></item><item><title>100%有效的癌症疫苗？俄罗斯的Enteromix在试验中取得成功；以下是完整的报告-《经济时报》</title><link>https://m.economictimes.com/news/new-updates/a-100-effective-cancer-vaccine-russias-enteromix-achieves-success-in-trials-heres-the-full-report-you-need-to-read/articleshow/123749832.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-brcount="21" class="artText"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vaccine that could change the way we fight cancer is making headlines. Russia’s Enteromix has reportedly achieved 100% efficacy in preclinical trials, showing both safety and strong tumour-fighting abilities, according to a report by Tass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veronika Skvortsova, head of the Federal Medical and Biological Agency (FMBA), revealed the results at the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_123749832" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-123749832"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The research spanned several years, with the last three dedicated to mandatory preclinical studies. The vaccine is now ready for use; we are awaiting official approval,” Tass quoted her as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skvortsova stressed that repeated administration of the vaccine remained safe, while also showing impressive results. Tumour growth slowed by 60–80%, survival rates improved, and significant reductions in tumour size were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First target: colorectal cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine’s initial focus will be on colorectal cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. But the research does not stop there. Scientists are also developing versions for glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumour, and specific types of melanoma, including ocular melanoma, all of which are at advanced stages of study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_123749832" id="div-vdoai-mid-123749832"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us associate vaccines with childhood diseases such as measles or chickenpox. These train the immune system to recognise dangerous germs. Cancer vaccines work on a similar principle, but instead of viruses, they help the body spot and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-123749832" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Cancer Society, some cancer vaccines already exist for bladder and prostate cancers, while the HPV vaccine prevents several types of cancer before they begin.

While many people know these crunchy green seeds help balance blood sugar levels, there’s a lot more to them than meets the eye. According to U.S.-based gastroenterologist Dr. Pal Manickam, pumpkin seeds are one of the most underrated superfoods you can easily include in your diet, and they’re surprisingly affordable too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent Instagram video and a post on X (formerly Twitter), Dr. Pal shares seven science-backed reasons to add pumpkin seeds to your daily routine. “If you're not including pumpkin seeds in your diet, you're seriously missing out,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_123668491" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-123668491"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what makes these little seeds so powerful? Let’s break down the seven benefits he shared, including one he calls his personal favourite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;1. Boosts Immunity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin seeds are rich in zinc, a key mineral that strengthens the immune system and helps your body fight infections more effectively. Including them in your meals can be a tasty way to keep seasonal illnesses at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;2. Supports Heart Health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to their high magnesium content, pumpkin seeds help maintain a steady heartbeat and regulate blood pressure. Magnesium is also known to support overall cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_123668491" id="div-vdoai-mid-123668491"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-123668491" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;3. Improves Mood and Relaxation&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin seeds contain tryptophan, an amino acid that converts into serotonin, the “feel-good” hormone. This can help improve mood, reduce anxiety, and promote better sleep, something many people overlook when managing stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="2" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-123668491" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="5" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-123668491" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="3" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-123668491" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;4. Strengthens Bones&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;These seeds also offer a good dose of phosphorus and magnesium, which are essential for bone strength and density. Regular consumption may reduce your risk of conditions like osteoporosis later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;5. Balances Blood Sugar&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most well-known benefit, pumpkin seeds help regulate insulin levels and keep blood sugar in check, thanks again to their magnesium content. This makes them a smart snack option for people managing diabetes or prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN-q3UmCZKU/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h5&gt;6. Helps with Cravings and Weight Loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pal’s personal favourite benefit: curbing cravings. Packed with healthy fats and protein, pumpkin seeds keep you full for longer, making it easier to avoid mindless snacking and overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;7. Protects Skin and Eyes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loaded with antioxidants like vitamin E and carotenoids, these seeds help reduce inflammation, slow signs of aging, and protect your eyes and skin from damage caused by environmental stress.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is Dr Pal Manickam?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the unversed, Dr. Pal Manickam is not your average doctor. Known for mixing health advice with humour, he has built a large following across social media. He shares easy-to-understand, science-based health tips, often focusing on gut health, intermittent fasting, and holistic wellness. Dr. Pal completed his MBBS at PSG Medical College, Coimbatore, India, then a Master's in Public Health at the University of Massachusetts, Boston and an MD in Internal Medicine at Wayne State University, Detroit, before steeping into gastroenterology fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pumpkin Seeds vs Flax and Chia seeds?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Healthline, pumpkin seeds stand out as a simple yet powerful superfood. While flaxseeds and chia seeds are rich in fiber and omega-3s, pumpkin seeds don’t need grinding and offer a wider variety of nutrients, including zinc, magnesium, and protein. This makes them an easy, all-in-one option for daily nutrition.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-align="" data-msid="123668794" data-type="image" class="midImg clearfix"&gt;&lt;figure

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;tells a heartrending tale of expecting to grow up and be just like her sister, but was sorely disappointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

procedures corrected bowed legs, reduced pain, and allowed her to live more independently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, when she turned 16, the answer came in the form of three bone-cutting and stretching operations for her legs and arms, which, fortunately, were deemed necessary and thus covered by her life insurance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, she stands a proud 4 feet 11 and is using every inch to spread the word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chandler Crews could say

her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“For so long, the compliments and kind remarks I received, and thought were genuine, were really just a facade,” she recalled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While her brother was being complimented for his intelligence and her sister lauded for her art, Crews would get a pat on the head for “just being…me.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She remembers feeling like a “show dog” because of the head patting and people wanting to shake her hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the age of 16, she started speaking up and telling these individuals that she did not like being touched.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote

data-instgrm-version="14"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Her assertiveness resulted in calls for her parents to discipline her because she was “unmannered.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aside from the pain that influenced her decision to get the limb-lengthening procedures, she “just wanted to be normal”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Crews started her limb-lengthening procedures at the same age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“At 16, I spent seven months in and out of a wheelchair,” she recalled, and then underwent the procedure again three years later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These detracted from her parents’ narrative on embracing her dwarfism. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="471976723_18472560655014644_7549277363499341291_n-68bd91facf985__700"

Below are answers to some common questions the general public may have on the new updated Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;How Many Updated Covid Vaccines Are There?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, there will be three new updated Covid vaccines. A Moderna vaccine has been approved for those six months of age and older, a Pfizer vaccine for those five years of age and older, and a Novavax vaccine for those 12 years of age and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;What Strain(s) Will The Vaccines Protect Against?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updated vaccines will target the JN.1 lineage of Covid-19, using the LP.8.1 strain. This lineage is a descendant of the Omicron variant of the virus. Currently, the dominant strain in the United States that is causing most infections is the XFG, or “stratus” variant, according to data from &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=Cm4KMFNBUlPigJNDb1bigJMyOiBBbGwgU2VxdWVuY2VkIFNpdGVzIChBZ2dyZWdhdGVkKRADIAFAAUgAUgZzZXF1ZW5aBk4gR2VuZXIKMjAyMy0wNy0wOHIKMjAyNS0wOC0zMIoBBmFmMDliNsABAQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=af09b6&amp;amp;ref=wwscan.ghost.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=Cm4KMFNBUlPigJNDb1bigJMyOiBBbGwgU2VxdWVuY2VkIFNpdGVzIChBZ2dyZWdhdGVkKRADIAFAAUgAUgZzZXF1ZW5aBk4gR2VuZXIKMjAyMy0wNy0wOHIKMjAyNS0wOC0zMIoBBmFmMDliNsABAQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=af09b6&amp;amp;ref=wwscan.ghost.io" aria-label="WastewaterSCAN."&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=Cm4KMFNBUlPigJNDb1bigJMyOiBBbGwgU2VxdWVuY2VkIFNpdGVzIChBZ2dyZWdhdGVkKRADIAFAAUgAUgZzZXF1ZW5aBk4gR2VuZXIKMjAyMy0wNy0wOHIKMjAyNS0wOC0zMIoBBmFmMDliNsABAQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=af09b6&amp;amp;ref=wwscan.ghost.io"&gt;WastewaterSCAN.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the XFG is a descendant of the Omicron variant and is closely related to the LP.8.1 strain of the virus, the newly updated Covid vaccines should offer protection against this dominant variant and will be effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death, per the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf" aria-label="World Health Organization"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;Who Can Get The Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, anyone six months of age and older were eligible to receive Covid shots. That changed recently when the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" aria-label="restricted"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929"&gt;restricted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the vaccine for those 65 years of age and older, or for younger individuals six months of age and older with an underlying condition that would put them at high risk for severe Covid infection. These individuals will likely be able to get the vaccine at various healthcare clinics and pharmacies with insurance covering the cost of the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;What Qualifies As High Risk For Severe Covid Infection?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those under 65 years of age will need to have at least one medical condition that would put that at high risk for severe Covid in order to get the new updated Covid vaccine. Although it remains unclear exactly how many and what conditions qualify for putting one at severe risk for Covid infection, the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" aria-label="CDC"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929"&gt;CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; back in February identified 22 qualifying conditions that include obesity, depression, diabetes, asthma and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This risk could be modified this month by the CDC since the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is set to meet September 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; to make formal recommendations on the Covid vaccine. In addition, although pregnancy was included back in February as a qualifying condition for getting the Covid vaccine, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has since &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=46&amp;amp;t=kBbEX3mrEOJAU2F44vYIZQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=46&amp;amp;t=kBbEX3mrEOJAU2F44vYIZQ" aria-label="stated"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=46&amp;amp;t=kBbEX3mrEOJAU2F44vYIZQ"&gt;stated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that healthy pregnant individuals would not qualify to get the shots. Further clarification will likely come later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;Can You Still Get The Covid Vaccine If You Want To And Do Not Qualify Under The FDA Restrictions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a healthy young adult or child that does not have an underlying condition that would put you at risk for severe Covid, in theory you could still potentially get a Covid shot, but there could be significant barriers. Most adults would need to get a prescription from their doctor and then present it at a pharmacy or health clinic to get the vaccine. For children, Secretary Kennedy is now requiring shared decision making between parents and physicians, which requires a conversation in order to possibly get a prescription for the Covid vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there may be significant barriers for each of the above situations to play out. For example, some Americans may not have a primary care doctor, thus precluding them from getting a prescription for the Covid shot. Even if they were to get a prescription, they may not be willing to pay the $150 for the Covid vaccine, particularly if they are uninsured and have to pay the cost out of pocket. More than 27 million Americans lack health insurance, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/releases/20250624.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/releases/20250624.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/releases/20250624.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, some physicians may be reluctant to write a prescription for the Covid vaccine “off-label” since it has not been officially recommended or approved by the FDA for a certain subset of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACIP is set to meet September 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, and the outcome of that meeting and subsequent CDC approval could provide further clarification on Covid vaccine approvals and whether or not insurance companies will cover the shots, since insurance coverage for many plans is intimately tied with the recommendations from the ACIP and CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

According to a new study looking at generations of couples and their respective psychiatric issues from around the world, you might be onto something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a wide-ranging new study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02298-z" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:for the journal Nature Human Behavior;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;for the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looking at data from nearly 15 million people, researchers from institutions in the Denmark, Taiwan, and the United States found that both members of couples in those disparate cultures often share mental health diagnoses — and that it's been that way for more than half a century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Building on a 2016 paper &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2494707" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in the;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;in the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2494707" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:journal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; that looked solely at Swedish databases, a consortium of researchers hailing from Oklahoma's Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Denmark's Institute of Biological Psychiatry, and Taiwan's National Health Research Institutes, used national registries in those three countries to investigate how many couples share psychiatric diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The psychiatric and population experts behind this newer study focused on nine mental health disorders: anorexia nervosa, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia, and substance-use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Separating the data into 10-year-long generational cohorts between the 1930s to the 1990s, the researchers found a slight uptick in couples sharing diagnoses — a phenomenon known in science-speak as "spousal correlations" — with each passing decade, especially for those with substance use disorder. (It's not hard to see why: recreational drug use and its dark flip-sides, abuse and addiction, &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/6331/decades-drug-use-data-from-60s-70s.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:exploded during the 1960s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;exploded during the 1960s&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The also found that when one partner was diagnosed with any of the nine disorders studied, the other was very likely to be diagnosed with one as well — and likely the same diagnosis. There were, naturally, a few caveats: Taiwanese married couples were more likely to share OCD diagnoses than their Nordic counterparts, for example, and neither bipolar disorder nor anorexia were&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;exhibited in couples across all cultures either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The main result is that the pattern holds across countries, across cultures, and, of course, generations," explained paper author and geneticist Chun Chieh Fan of Oklahoma's Laureate Institute for Brain Research in an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02772-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interview with Nature magazine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt;. The trend has remained consistent even with massive changes in psychiatric care over the past half-century, the researcher added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though this paper didn't dig into &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; people with similar mental health problems tend to sniff each other out, Fan offered up a few theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Perhaps they better understand each other due to shared suffering," he told&lt;em&gt; Nature&lt;/em&gt;, "so they attract each other."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The geneticist also suggested that coming from similar environments may make people more alike, and more likely to find each other — and, tragically, that mental health stigma may make people who suffer from similar psychiatric disorders feel their dating prospects are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Whatever the cause behind these wild findings, it's fascinating that so many couples from so such disparate cultures and generations seem to share mental illnesses — and in a certain light, it's almost romantic to consider that your spouse may be just as crazy as you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on relationship psychology: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/scientists-identify-ideal-amount-boinking-100048880.html" data-ylk="slk:Scientists Identify Ideal Amount of Boinking for Maximum Mental Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientists Identify Ideal Amount of Boinking for Maximum Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 13:45:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNakgwaFh5NW5kUWttNWk0NEFyREx3eHhSTzZzNTV4UjNyY0VYM0Y3ZHFKUFlWb1VWWS04T2FPYkZ6R1pMRi1fc1UtdkFqc2ZIcnlvaUpkSy1ydEc0M2F6NENvTTJobVU5Ym5OVzR2N1I1R0NXQmlOSFVabkVqczdXaFluZlJqMm9rUmJiSkxwbGo</guid></item><item><title>如何知道自己的动脉是否堵塞：医生分享了4项基本的无创检查-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/how-to-know-if-ones-arteries-are-blocked-doctor-shares-4-essential-non-invasive-tests/articleshow/123746976.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-articlebody="1" class="fewcent-123746976 js_tbl_article"&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The smaller body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8322926/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; surface area of Indians leads to smaller coronary artery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; dimensions. Narrower the arteries, higher the risk of early blockage. But the worst part is, blocked artery symptoms aren’t easy to identify. Eating clean, following a healthy lifestyle aren’t enough. However, certain symptoms can be identified through standard medical tests. In a recent video Cardiovascular Surgeon Dr Jeremy London shared 4 tests that can help identify blocked arteries and lower the risk of Cardiovascular complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Track your Blood Pressure with regular check-ups&lt;br&gt;            &lt;p type="image" title="Doctors recommend regular blood pressure check-ups" msid="123747068" hostid="83"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Jeremy explains blood pressure gets easily modified by lifestyle changes. According to The World Health Organisation (WHO), only 12% of the Indian population have blood pressure under control. High blood pressure is a ‘silent killer’ that increases the risk of blocked arteries as it damages the artery walls and leads to the accumulation of fatty deposits. Tracking blood pressure is critical for early detection and can lower the risk of blocked arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advanced Blood Panel can detect hidden risks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Advances Blood Panel goes beyond the standard blood tests. It is a set of blood tests that identifies the hidden dangers of Atherosclerosis or Plaque build-up in the arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a basic blood panel usually checks cholesterol and sugar, an Advances Blood Panel goes beyond that and may reveal number and type of cholesterol particles, inflammation in blood vessels and blood clotting tendency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/ask-the-doctor-heart-attack-despite-low-cholesterol" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Researchers have found&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, even if cholesterol numbers are low, one can still develop blocked arteries that lead to the risk of heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEXA Scan- measures the ‘dangerous’ body fat&lt;br&gt;            &lt;p type="image" title="DEXA scan can identify Visceral fat" msid="123747086" hostid="83"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visceral fat or the ‘dangerous’ fat around internal organs of the abdominal area is a risk factor for Artery Blockage. Cardiovascular Surgeon Dr London describes Visceral fat as ‘an engine for inflammation’. The third test Dr London recommends is DEXA scan or the Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry. DEXA Scan reveals the level of Visceral fat in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32127334/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Identification of Visceral fat is crucial &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;as it secretes inflammatory proteins into the bloodstream that damage the Endothelium, the inner lining of arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;b&gt;VO2 Max test- ‘most powerful determinants of longevity’&lt;br&gt;            &lt;p type="image" title="VO2 Max test measures cardiovascular efficiency" msid="123747093" hostid="83"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth test Dr London recommends and describes as the most powerful determinants of longevity is the VO2 Max Test.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The next time you find yourself in a car, driving along a winding road, why not turn on an uplifting tune? It might help you recover from motion sickness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A team of researchers led by neuroscientist Yilun Li at China's Henan Institute of Science and Technology has found music may be a surprisingly effective intervention for reducing nausea and dizziness induced by travel. Depending on the song.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In experiments, 30 participants were subject to a driving simulator, in which they were made to feel carsick while wearing an electroencephalograph (EEG) cap. This allowed researchers to 'read' the brain activity of volunteers in real time, as it transitioned from a stable state to a state of motion sickness, and gradually back again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants were divided into six groups. Four groups listened to a minute of music after the nauseating drive; one listened to no music after the drive, spending 1 minute meditating instead; and one ended the drive right before participants were expected to feel nauseated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mozart-can-act-as-a-painkiller-for-newborns-first-of-its-kind-trial-suggests"&gt;Mozart Can Act as a Painkiller For Newborns, First-of-Its-Kind Trial Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers found that joyful music alleviated symptoms of carsickness by 14 percent compared to the group that meditated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soft music was the next best genre. It alleviated symptoms by 13.4 percent compared to controls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interestingly, one type of music reduced nausea at a rate worse than simply waiting for the feelings of carsickness to pass. Sad music seemed to make recovery harder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173047" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173047" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fnhum-19-1636109-g001-642x331.jpg" alt="Motion Sickness" class="size-medium wp-image-173047" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fnhum-19-1636109-g001-642x331.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fnhum-19-1636109-g001-805x415.jpg 805w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fnhum-19-1636109-g001-768x396.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fnhum-19-1636109-g001-1536x791.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fnhum-19-1636109-g001-600x309.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fnhum-19-1636109-g001.jpg 1902w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173047" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The motion sickness experiment, which simulated a nauseating drive.

The better they recovered, meanwhile, the more varied activity the EEG caps recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sad music may exacerbate discomfort through emotional resonance," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2025.163610"&gt;hypothesize&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas cheerful or relaxing music may help participants maintain a good physical state, "thus enhancing the comfort of the occupants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2025.1636109"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Frontiers in Human Neuroscience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="custom-html embed-container mv-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A question from a reader: &lt;/strong&gt;How can a bipolar patient get rid of “racing thoughts?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first sat down to answer your question, my mind instantly went to medication. What else could I talk about? As if we could clap our hands together and cleanly solve what is a quite complex and sometimes difficult experience for bipolar folks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A moment later, I realized I was internally perpetuating the same experience that most bipolar clients I’ve worked with have described when they share their symptoms with a practitioner — focusing on the biochemical and symptom management over the emotional and relational experiences that come with being bipolar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That glossing over reflects to me a larger cultural attitude about bipolar that influences the general public, including clinicians: Many of us don’t know enough about it or how to talk about it, so we fear it instead of being curious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-component embed-container column-width-embed u-border-t u-border-b u-border-light-gray mv-40 pv-20"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike anxiety and depression (and, to some extent, certain forms of PTSD), which have gone through a cultural shift, bipolar disorders are still highly stigmatized and misunderstood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t know there are different subclassifications of bipolar with distinct features. All bipolar diagnoses are characterized by drastic mood shifts that are biochemical in origin, but Bipolar I is distinct from Bipolar II or cyclothymia, for example, based on whether someone has periods of higher-intensity mania versus hypomania, which is less intense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And far less talked about than mania are the periods of intense depression that bipolar folks go through; this is a common symptom that can be just as debilitating and require additional treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The depressive episodes get less emphasized because they are more internal and private. Often we focus on how bipolar impacts other people: A manic episode is more outwardly visible, so that gets our attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find that I have to establish trust more gradually for someone to open up about their bipolar in session. They need to know that I as a practitioner can hold space for everything else beyond symptom management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many, no one has asked how they feel about their mania or hypomania. No one has asked how they talk to their loved ones or people new in their lives about their diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many, it feels like something they have to keep tight control on to be respected and to prevent them from being hospitalized (which can be a traumatizing experience and for some involves encounters with law enforcement). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each person’s relationship to their bipolar will be different. Some clients resonate with it as an identity and a lens through which they uniquely see the world. Some relate to it as a part of them that they want to keep well managed and separate from the other parts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However someone makes meaning of their experience, I want my office to be a space where they feel safe to share their full selves. Maybe there are parts of bipolar that you love — like the creativity and energy to get things done that comes with a period of up energy — and parts that feel scary or shameful — like overspending or exhibiting risky behavior, or the feeling of falling off a cliff into depression. It’s OK to have all those things coexist at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relational aspect is not divorced from the biochemical; they influence each other. Bipolar is not a fixed state. If someone experiences a great stressor in their life, their mood shifts might be elevated. If there is a big break in routine or they’re getting less sleep or changes in relationships, those shifts might also come on more strongly or last longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it’s important to take a holistic look at what’s going on in your life that might influence how your bipolar is showing up, and to keep an eye on whether you’re reaching a threshold where there is potential risk of self-harm or danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To return to your direct question about racing thoughts, we can talk about it from multiple perspectives. How do you feel about the racing thoughts? What’s going on in your life that might increase them? Are there also patterns or strategies that can help return to baseline? Or does it merit a discussion about medication use or changes? How can you be compassionate with yourself when life changes and you have to shift your strategies as a result?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you are connected to people in your life and practitioners who are committed to going beyond the top-line answer. And I hope that together you can find your own balance of meaning-making and care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-component embed-container column-width-embed u-border-t u-border-b u-border-light-gray mv-40 pv-20"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve written about men getting &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/people-are-paying-six-figures-for-leg-lengthening-surgery-instead-of-going-to-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;leg-lengthening&lt;/a&gt; surgery before. They’re spending thousands of dollars and months of recovery to inch closer to six feet. But now, women are heading in the opposite direction. Not to correct deformities or injury. Just to be…shorter. In the hope that it will help them in the love department.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/heightreduction/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clinics in Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; are offering a new kind of cosmetic service: limb-shortening surgery for women who believe their height is working against them romantically. And while it might sound like the setup to a dystopian rom-com, it’s very real and very painful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-64458484" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-64458484" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Surgeons cut the femur or tibia, remove bone, then secure what’s left with a metal rod. The upper leg can be reduced by up to 5.5 centimeters (2.2 inches), the lower leg by 3 centimeters (1.2 inches). One woman reportedly went from 172 to 167.9 centimeters (5’7¾” to 5’6″).&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Most clinics promote the surgery as part of a complete “package,” including hospitalization, city tours, restaurant dinners, and even boat rides. But the post-op reality isn’t glamorous. Patients spend months recovering, often in wheelchairs, with intensive physical therapy four to five times a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-75334524" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-75334524" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Risks include nerve damage, bone infections, muscle weakness, and nonunion fractures that may never heal properly. Metal rods have weight limits, too, so you need to be under 75 kg (165 lbs) to even qualify.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-women-are-undergoing-limb-shortening-surgery-just-for-love"&gt;Women Are Undergoing Limb-Shortening Surgery Just for Love&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15025475/Women-flying-Turkey-brutal-LEG-SHORTENING-operations-make-petite.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one Istanbul clinic has done at least 10 cosmetic limb-shortening surgeries since 2023. And while no global registry tracks these procedures yet, forums and Reddit threads have started filling up with stories from tall women who say they’ve struggled to date. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-37845057" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-37845057" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;One reason? Height politics. Studies show that most men prefer women shorter than themselves, and women tend to prefer taller partners. That leaves some taller women caught in between, and apparently willing to sacrifice inches to close the gap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the absurdity of breaking your legs to be shorter, height has been directly connected to health. &lt;a href="https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2011/07/21/height-and-cancer-risk-the-long-and-short-of-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Researchers have linked&lt;/a&gt; tall stature in women to conditions like endometriosis and increased cancer risk. But that’s not what’s driving this particular trend. For many, it circles back to dating and the belief that being smaller may make them more “approachable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-18349350" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-18349350" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It’s a complicated equation. Shrinking yourself to feel seen by someone else seems a bit over the top. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

The disease causes muscle degeneration and weakness due to a mutation in the gene that produces dystrophin, a protein that protects muscle fibers from breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease, which mostly affects boys, gets worse over time. It makes it difficult to walk, run, jump, and play, with children often delayed in reaching milestones like crawling, walking and talking. The boys will likely use wheelchairs when they are teenagers, and life expectancy ranges between 30 and 40 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bVpsol"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/16/IMG_2079.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/16/IMG_2079.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/16/IMG_2079.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Hunter, 10, (left) and brother Noah, 9, (right) were diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in 2017.

But when Hunter’s application was submitted in late May, authorization for exactly the same treatment was denied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reason on our denial letters is that it's not medically necessary,” the mom-of-three said from her home in Winnetka, just outside Chicago. “It was very blindsiding. They didn't ever deny my other son, it was approved the first go. So I was very taken aback.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alison, a physician, and her husband William, who works in finance, are now grappling with how to move forward following the decision from health insurance giant, Blue Cross Blue Shield. They say they have been put in an impossible and “heartbreaking” situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Independent &lt;/em&gt;contacted Blue Cross Blue Shield for comment, and asked why the treatment was only covered for Noah when both boys have the same disease. &lt;em&gt;The Independent &lt;/em&gt;also asked the company whether it would reconsider the denial in Hunter’s case and to respond to accusations that the decision was “unfair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To protect our member’s privacy, we do not publicly discuss individual cases,” a Blue Cross Blue Shield spokesperson said. “We do want our members to know that medical experts, including doctors, are involved in reviews to ensure the treatments and services our members receive are evidence-based and not duplicative. Decisions are guided by nationwide best practices for care, helping to identify what has proven successful for members in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With every passing day, Hunter’s condition gets worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His muscle is wasting away every day,” Alison, 44, said. “He's going to be in a wheelchair in the next few years and it just doesn't seem right that they are not going to allow him to get this treatment. They're wasting his time. And it’s just not fair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brothers were diagnosed with DND in 2017 after tests showed Hunter had elevated liver enzymes, which is indicative of the condition. Three months later, when further tests showed the levels had not returned to normal, a specialist delivered the devastating diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DND is a genetic disorder and so Noah and 12-year-old brother Carter were tested following Hunter’s diagnosis. Carter did not have the disease, but Noah’s results came back positive. It was a triple blow for Alison, who not only had to process the fact that two of her children had the life-limiting illness but that she was a carrier of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parents and their eldest son Carter have had to go through the pain of witnessing Hunter and Noah gradually decline over the years, as DND has no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in 2023, there was a glimmer of hope when the gene therapy, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.parentprojectmd.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ELEVIDYS-FAQ-for-community.pdf"&gt;Elevidys&lt;/a&gt;, manufactured by Sarepta Therapeutics, received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 ethnCd"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/22/IMG_4651.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/22/IMG_4651.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/22/IMG_4651.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Alison and husband William, pictured with their boys Hunter, Noah and Carter.

Both of the younger boys were diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in 2017, which has no cure&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Alison Joseph)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new treatment, which comes with a $3.2 million price tag, helps improve muscle function and motor skills. So far, over 900 patients have had the treatment, the company says, but given how novel the medicine is, critics say there is limited evidence that the benefits of the treatment outweigh the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But doctors are cautiously optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these newer gene transfer therapies are opening doors for these boys to possibly live longer and lead a good quality of life,” said Dr Aravindhan Veerapandiyan of Arkansas Children’s Hospital. “It’s changing the trajectory of the disease, changing the trajectory of their lives, improving the quality of life for the boys and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevidys is not without controversy. It was approved by the FDA in 2023 but limited to children between 4 and 5 years old, who are able to walk. In 2024, the treatment was expanded to include patients 4 years and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Public Citizen, a nonprofit which acts an ethics watchdog for clinical trials, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.citizen.org/article/failed-trials-yet-full-fda-approval-of-a-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy-gene-therapy/"&gt;said the FDA approval was “ill-advised”&lt;/a&gt; because it was “not supported by favorable FDA scientific reviews”. Nor did clinical trials demonstrate that children with the disease “maintained or regained gross motor abilities”, the group added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was heightened concern in July when the FDA told Sarepta to suspend distribution of the drug while the agency investigated the death of an 8-year-old boy. The FDA subsequently concluded the death was “unrelated to the gene therapy product itself” but the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-recommends-removal-voluntary-hold-elevidys-ambulatory-patients"&gt;agency has still recommended the company pause&lt;/a&gt; distribution of the drug in patients who cannot walk. However, this doesn’t apply to Noah or Hunter, who can both still walk and play with their older brother, Carter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Alison and William, Elevidys was worth trying. “We had very serious conversations with our doctors, but we also know the natural progression of the disease,” Alison said. “So we were willing to take that risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noah has had “very obvious and noticeable improvements” since his treatment in March at &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.archildrens.org/blog/revolutionary-gene-therapies"&gt;Arkansas Children’s Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Little Rock, his parents said. Elevidys was administered as a one-time infusion.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“End of day fatigue and leg pain was something that he complained of frequently, and he has not complained of it once since getting gene therapy,” Alison said. “He learned how to swim this summer. His overall endurance is so much better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunter, meanwhile, continues to suffer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So many people now will say,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Oh my gosh, Noah's doing so well… We can't believe he's swimming, he's this, he's that,” Alison said.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;And, I'm like, Oh my gosh, please don't let Hunter hear… because I know that he's thinking that he's not able to do those things. And it's just heartbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Noah’s treatment was given the green light by the insurance company, both boys underwent their routine, annual cardiac MRIs to take a closer look at their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bLBZUf"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/11/IMG_5130.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/11/IMG_5130.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/15/11/IMG_5130.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Noah has had “very obvious and noticeable improvements” since his treatment in March at Arkansas Children’s Hospital in Little Rock, his parents said.

Therefore, the family decided that Noah should have the treatment first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We collectively made a decision that the safest thing to do is give it to his brother,” Alison explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insurance company gave the green light for Noah’s treatment on November 1, 2024, and he received it a few months later in March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Noah’s treatment went well, doctors, including cardiologists, then gave their approval in April for Hunter to have the same treatment. BCBS denied coverage for the treatment in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were so excited that they gave us the green light. It was like, Oh my gosh, let's go. Let's do it,” Alison recalled. “We told Hunter, ‘It’s your turn,’ never expecting the insurance to say no.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mom asked: “I mean, how could they say no to him when they already said yes to his brother and he successfully had it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, after digging through health insurance paperwork, Alison and William claim that after Noah received approval from BCBS in November 2024 for Elevidys, the insurance firm “quietly” updated company policy on January 1, 2025 to exclude the children’s specific DND mutation from coverage for the gene therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don't think it's coincidence,” Alison said. “I think that they knew that we had another child and we were going to be seeking this out [again.]” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insurance company did not address the allegation when&lt;em&gt; The Independent&lt;/em&gt; contacted them for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parents are running out of options to get their son the life-improving treatment unless BCBS reconsiders the claim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have appealed the decision with the insurance giant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple has also contacted representatives in Arkansas, where Hunter would receive the gene therapy treatment, and in their home state of Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arkansas state representatives Andrew Collins and Tippi McCullough both offered the family assistance, while Arkansas U.S. Senator Tom Cotton supported the family in reaching out to the federal Office of Personnel Management, Alison said. The parents have also consulted with a lawyer to weigh their options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am starting to feel helpless,” said Alison. “I feel like we have tried to make the best decisions for them all these years, and now the choice has been taken away from us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time is not on Hunter’s side and the gene therapy is his best chance of having the most comfortable life possible, his parents said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the age when the boys really do start to decline pretty quickly,” said Alison. “We have seen a significant decline in him in the last few months, which is just so scary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The therapy can stop the disease’s progression. We are just watching him decline before our eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 12:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQbVVUTE1Xd2lCUXhjRktNckNSYVh1Wk8wbjVMMFU0ZFBLMndQdVduMHM3SGphSHV4Z0ZTMUlDbURQZVJfMmZQM2tKUm9UQXEyME8tSlUtQjlRc3JKcG9kQlhkNl9PNTczSURhZW1pYjkxRjBNdE1ONzBsakdCcmZjNkNrNjYtRVZwVnJMVUQ1X3U0X3R4S0dZRkVPZGlScWdiakZlZ0ZB</guid></item><item><title>诉讼称患者在CT扫描延迟超过10小时后死亡- San Diego Union-Tribune</title><link>https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/07/lawsuit-alleges-patient-died-after-more-than-10-hour-delay-in-getting-ct-scan/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A civil lawsuit against Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center alleges that a doctor’s order for a patient’s immediate chest X-ray was delayed for more than 10 hours, contributing to his death from a pulmonary embolism — a major blood clot that blocked the arteries of his lungs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the details of the case are particular to one individual, experts say the outcome is far too common, illustrating the need for greater vigilance of, and advocacy around, a threat that kills a person e&lt;/span&gt;very six minutes, &lt;a href="https://www.stoptheclot.org/blood-clot-information/blood-clots-in-the-united-states/"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the National Blood Clot Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical research has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6344107/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that the risk of clots forming, especially in the deep veins of the legs, increases with the length of a hospital stay. Even short periods of convalescence, from one to three days, increase the likelihood of a condition called deep venous thrombosis, which can cause clots to break loose in the extremities and travel through the bloodstream, passing through the heart and lodging in the lungs. And this elevated risk continues even after patients are discharged home, making the need for ongoing preventive measures critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Andrew Gabor, this ramp of elevated risk started in Denver during a hospital stay to treat a significant infection. Medical records provided for review by his sister, Maria Healey, show that the 38-year-old man, who was working two jobs, had type 2 diabetes, which contributed to the infection, causing a difficult recovery. Determined to ease her brother’s path, Healey brought him to live with her and her family in Chula Vista, a move that allowed Gabor to continue working remotely in order to keep his health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Being the oldest sister, I just felt that need and desire to take care of him as the youngest brother,” Healey said. “Our mom wasn’t able to do it because she has MS, and so I offered to take him home, and he agreed to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during his convalescence that Gabor began to experience extreme back pain that seemed to be triggered by sitting wrong on the couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the course of two or three days, he just couldn’t get comfortable, and he was brought to the point of tears because he was in so much pain, and we finally decided he needed to go to the ER,” Healey said. “He also started feeling this numbness in his leg that was driving him crazy because he couldn’t walk anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed that a very large herniated disc and narrowing of the spine were causing the back pain. Sharp Chula Vista admitted Gabor on Feb. 16, 2024, and he underwent spinal decompression and fusion surgery six days later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back brace in place, Gabor began physical therapy after the surgery, still spending most of his time in a hospital bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days after the surgery, Healey said she received a call from her brother early in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He was just really alarmed, almost in tears … he said … I’m just worried I might have had a heart attack, I’m not really sure what’s happening, maybe I’m having a panic attack or anxiety attack,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She arrived not long after to learn that her brother had experienced severe chest pain when attempting to get up to use the bathroom. His heart was racing, his breathing distressed. Required to leave by 8:30 p.m. due to the end of visiting hours, Healey said she returned the following day and was disheartened to see that her brother’s affect had considerably worsened, his skin taking on a gray pallor. He died shortly thereafter, on March 4, 2024, his death certificate later listing the main cause as a bilateral pulmonary embolism.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Healey said she had many concerns about the care her brother received during his stay, from the &lt;span&gt;lack of &lt;/span&gt;responsiveness of some members of the nursing staff to the fact that he was not transferred to the hospital’s intensive care unit when the chest pain started. But she said she was flabbergasted when she received the results of a state investigation by the California Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The report came almost an entire year after he died and, when I got it, I was shaking as I read through the papers,” Healey said. “I just couldn’t believe what they had found, and I felt vindicated that he shouldn’t have died, that I was right that something had happened, that this shouldn’t have happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copy of the state’s investigative report, based on multiple interviews and reviews of medical records, says that a CT angiography of Gabor’s chest “was completed 12 hours after it was ordered,”&lt;span&gt; a slightly more precise estimate than the lawsuit cites.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While investigators report that hospital policies do not explicitly define the meaning of the term STAT, investigators say in their write-up that a subsequent interview with an X-ray technician said that staff “knew it was supposed to be completed ‘right away.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interview with a hospital physician also “stated that the expectation was for a STAT order to be completed within one hour … or there was no point (in) ordering (it to be completed) STAT.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was very angry, very very upset, because, as his older sister, I felt like I was there to protect him, and I wasn’t able to do that,” Healey said. “I was told he was in the best place, that he would be given the best care possible, and it just wasn’t the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting on behalf of her brother and of her mother, for whom she serves as a guardian, she sued Sharp in San Diego Superior Court on July 11, alleging wrongful death, abuse, neglect and negligence. The suit, served on Sharp last week, seeks unspecified punitive and compensatory damages and reimbursement for attorney’s fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp declined to comment on these allegations, indicating in an email that it does not comment on pending litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the report, and also her brother’s death certificate, sent her to the Internet looking for answers, where she found &lt;a href="https://www.stoptheclot.org/"&gt;stoptheclot.org&lt;/a&gt;, the website of the National Blood Clot Alliance. There she learned that blood clots are estimated to kill between 100,000 and 300,000 Americans per year, which the organization says “is greater than the total number of people who lose their lives each year to AIDS, breast cancer and motor vehicle crashes combined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also found that the organization had created its own acronym to help patients and their loved ones remember the signs and symptoms of imminent blood clot danger. S stands for swelling in the leg, T for tenderness and leg cramps, O for being out of breath, P for passing out, C for chest pain, L for leg discoloration, O for an overdriven heartbeat and T for time to call 911.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He fit so many of these that it’s just outrageous,” Healey said. “I wish I had known this ahead of time, and I wish that more people knew just how dangerous and fast this can be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rushad Patel, an oncologist with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a teaching hospital of Harvard University Medical School in Boston, reviewed Gabor’s death certificate and an excerpt from his medical record that outlined his condition, said that deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was likely the cause of the blood clot in the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A patient admitted with leg pain who later develops a fatal (pulmonary embolism) was likely experiencing a DVT that then migrated to the lungs,” Patel, also a member of the clot alliance, said in an email. “If the clot is large enough, it can severely affect the function of the heart and prevent proper oxygenation of the blood, which, if severe, can be fatal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preventive action, he added, is always the first order of business: “Hospitals are expected to assess every admitted patient for their risk of developing clots. For higher-risk patients, prevention can include medications, mechanical devices as well as early mobility. Medications include small doses of anticoagulants (such as heparin) to prevent clots from forming. Getting patients out of bed and walking as soon as it’s safe can keep the blood flowing and prevent clots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some patients who cannot move or have more limited mobility, external devices or compression stockings can help prevent clots as well. These measures, especially the use of anticoagulants, have to be balanced against bleeding risk. For example, if a patient has recently had surgery or bleeding complications, medications may not be safe, and the team will rely more on mechanical devices and mobility. The important principle is that clot prevention should always be actively considered and tailored to the individual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family members, he added, should feel empowered to ask if their loved one has been assessed for blood clot risk and what steps are in place to prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If medications are not being used, it’s reasonable to ask why — sometimes the answer is a high bleeding risk,” Patel said. “They can also look for practical signs: Are compression boots being used? Is the patient encouraged to walk or do leg exercises? Is the care team attentive to symptoms like swelling, redness, or pain in the legs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most importantly, family members and patients themselves can act as advocates by making sure prevention is on the radar. Knowing one’s risk factors and asking the questions signals to the care team that clot prevention matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabor’s medical records do indicate that he received “DVT prophylaxis” during his stay at the hospital, and Healey said she does remember him being given compression socks for his legs, though their purpose, she said, was not communicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was very unexplained what they were for,” she said. “They were these Velcro cuffs to put on, and he wasn’t told why he should use them; he was just told that they were there if he wanted to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added that a risk assessment is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t recall AJ ever having a risk assessment done when he was first admitted to the hospital, and I haven’t found proof that one was done,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

Addressing this, Cardiologist Dr Sanjay Bhojraj, who often shares insights on how to keep the heart healthy, revealed in an August 4 Instagram post about how one can keep their artery healthy without medication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-reveals-1-daily-habit-that-is-putting-young-healthy-people-in-20s-30s-suddenly-in-heart-failure-attack-101757213135869.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Cardiologist reveals 1 daily habit that's putting 'young, healthy people in their 20s and 30s suddenly in heart failure'"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardiologist reveals 1 daily habit that's putting 'young, healthy people in their 20s and 30s suddenly in heart failure'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Sanjay Bhojraj, after two decades as a functional cardiologist, shared in his post four personal observations on what helps keep heart arteries flexible and resilient. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He explained, “None of this is flashy. But when applied consistently, it’s the real ‘bulletproofing’ strategy for your heart and your future.” So this means that a healthy heart comes from daily habits which are consistent, not your quick fixes promising unrealistic things. And preventive measures early on help to safeguard your heart in the long run.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here are the four things he shared, and how they help:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Strength training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Builds muscle that stabilises blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lowers blood pressure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Prioritising omega-3s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat fatty fish, walnuts, and chia seeds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They help reduce inflammation and plaque buildup. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Consistent sleep rhythm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lowers cortisol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protects vessel lining.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Managing stress intentionally&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breathwork, meditation, or even daily walks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They support your nervous system and your arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have discovered that brain cancer cells reprogram their sugar metabolism, a vulnerability that can be exploited in mice to impede tumor growth and enhance therapeutic outcomes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glioblastomas are the most aggressive type of malignant brain tumor, and patients diagnosed with this condition typically survive only one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within these tumors, ordinary brain cells change their behavior, multiplying quickly and spreading into nearby tissue. Unlike healthy brain cells, the cancerous cells process nutrients in a fundamentally different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, scientists at the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/university-of-michigan/"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, including experts from the Rogel Cancer Center, the Department of Neurosurgery, and the Department of Biomedical Engineering, investigated how glioblastoma cells metabolize glucose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings revealed that these tumors rely on distinct nutrient pathways compared to normal brain tissue, offering new insight into potential treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We altered the diet in mouse models and were able significantly slow down and block the growth of these tumors,” said co-senior author Daniel Wahl, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of radiation oncology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study may help create new treatment opportunities for patients in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional treatments consist of surgery followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy. However, the tumors eventually return and become resistant to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, researchers have shown that resistance is due to metabolic rewiring within cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cancer cells in the brain use sugars differently compared to healthy cells&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolism is the process by which our bodies break down molecules like carbohydrates and proteins so that our cells can either use them or build new molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although both brain and cancer cells depend on sugar, the team wanted to see if they use sugar differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They injected small amounts of labelled sugar into mice and, importantly, into patients with brain tumors to follow how it is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To really understand these brain cancers and improve treatments for patients, we needed to do the hard work of studying the tumors in patients themselves, not just in the lab,” said co-senior author Wajd Al-Holou, M.D., a brain tumor neurosurgeon who co-directs the Michigan Multidisciplinary Brain Tumor Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although both normal tissues and tumor cells used a lot of sugar, they used it for different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a metabolic fork in the road,” said Andrew Scott, Ph.D., a research scholar in Wahl’s lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The brain channels sugar into energy production and neurotransmitters for thinking and health, but tumors redirect sugar to make materials for more cancer cells.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that healthy tissues used sugars to generate energy and make chemicals that allow the brain to function properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glioblastomas, on the other hand, turned off those processes and instead converted sugar into molecules like nucleotides—the building blocks of &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;DNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule made of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix. It serves as the hereditary material in humans and nearly all other organisms, encoding the genetic instructions used for development, functioning, and reproduction. Most DNA resides in the cell nucleus (nuclear DNA), while a smaller portion is found in mitochondria (mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; and RNA—that helped them grow and invade the surrounding tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Amino-acid restricted diets can improve treatment outcomes in mice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noticed other important differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The normal brain used sugar to make &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;amino acids&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Amino acids are organic molecules that serve as the building blocks of proteins, essential for nearly all biological processes. There are 20 standard amino acids, which combine in various sequences to form proteins with different structures and functions. Some are synthesized by the body, while others must be obtained through diet.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;amino acids&lt;/span&gt;, the building blocks of proteins. However, brain cancers seemed to turn this pathway off and instead scavenged these amino acids from the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding led the researchers to consider whether lowering the levels of certain amino acids in the blood could affect brain cancer without affecting the normal brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They tested whether mice that were fed an amino acid-restricted diet had better treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we got rid of the amino acids serine and glycine in the mice, their response to radiation and chemotherapy was better and the tumors were smaller than the control mice that were fed serine,” said co-senior author Deepak Nagrath, Ph.D. professor of biomedical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on their measurements in mice, the team also built mathematical models that can track how glucose is being used in different pathways, which can help identify other drug targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-senior author Costas Lyssiotis, Ph.D., professor of molecular and integrative physiology, compared metabolic pathways to roads and drugs to roadblocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropping a roadblock on a fast highway with a lot of traffic will have a greater effect than blocking a country road with a lower speed limit and only a few cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in a normal brain, the uptake of the amino &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;acid&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;An acid is a chemical substance that releases hydrogen ions (H⁺) when dissolved in water, resulting in a low pH (below 7). Acids are often characterized by their sour taste and their ability to react with bases to form salts and water. They play essential roles in biology, industry, and environmental processes.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;acid&lt;/span&gt; serine from the blood is like a slow country road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But brain cancer is like a busy freeway, giving researchers the opportunity to selectively target the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is working on opening clinical trials soon to test whether specialized diets that limit blood serine levels can also help glioblastoma patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a multidisciplinary effort from across the university,” Wahl said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a study that no individual investigator could do on their own and I’m grateful to be part of a team that works together to make important discoveries that can improve treatments for our patients.”&lt;/p&gt;

Today, the smartphone has taken that place, creating a new problem: much longer bathroom stays. Scrolling through social media or reading the news makes it easy to lose track of time, and every extra minute on the toilet adds unnecessary pressure on the rectum. That pressure builds up and can cause hemorrhoids, a painful condition that may involve itching and bleeding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="3ip5c-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3ip5c-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3ip5c-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Cases of hemorrhoids are rising among younger people, and a common habit may be one of the reasons: using a smartphone on the toilet. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="6cs18-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6cs18-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6cs18-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The new study, published in the medical journal PLOS One, found that phone use while sitting on the toilet raised hemorrhoid risk by 46%.

Hemorrhoids were diagnosed using endoscopy, an exam of the digestive tract.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="6rpl2-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6rpl2-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6rpl2-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Of all respondents, 66% used smartphones while on the toilet, and spent significantly more time there than those who did not. The most common activity performed by more than half (54%) was reading the news, followed by “social media” (44%).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="2u9gu-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="2u9gu-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2u9gu-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The difference was striking: 37% of smartphone users were spending more than five minutes per visit on the toilet, compared to only 7% of non-smartphone users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="dd5hb-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="dd5hb-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dd5hb-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“I’ve been warning my patients for years not to take their phones into the restroom,” said Dr. Benjamin Person, a senior colorectal surgeon and proctologist at the Haifa district. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="cuuh0-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cuuh0-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cuuh0-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;"Using the phone simply extends the time you spend sitting,” Person said. “And the longer you remain in that posture, the higher the risk of hemorrhoids. What used to be professional intuition is now supported by research data."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="7kits-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7kits-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7kits-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Can the findings apply to younger people?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7kits-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Although the research focused on adults 45 and older, Person said the findings likely apply to younger people as well, since they tend to take their phones everywhere. Along with a low-fiber diet and obesity, toilet scrolling is now seen as another risk factor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="ddsdu-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ddsdu-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ddsdu-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Why does the phone make it worse?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ddsdu-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The main problem is prolonged sitting. Unlike a solid chair, the toilet seat does not support the pelvic floor, allowing blood to pool in the rectal area and increase pressure. That pressure creates conditions for hemorrhoids to develop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="749j3-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="749j3-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="749j3-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Moreover, phone use also encourages people to lean forward, a posture that makes bowel movements less smooth. By contrast, squatting creates a better angle that reduces strain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="fdntd-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="fdntd-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="fdntd-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The study found that key risk factors were not associated with constipation or straining, but the length of time spent sitting. Passive phone use led to swelling in the rectal tissue, which can protrude and develop into hemorrhoids.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="c6q-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="c6q-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="c6q-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“The advice is simple,” Person said. “Do not take your phone into the toilet. Once it’s in your hands, you end up staying longer, thus increasing the risk of hemorrhoids."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="3mq7n-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3mq7n-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3mq7n-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;If you do bring it in, he added, try to limit the time. Current guidelines recommend no more than three to five minutes per visit. A timer can help, or even limiting yourself to two TikTok clips. The important thing is not to linger on the toilet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="a28po-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="a28po-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="a28po-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Another habit that can make the problem worse is holding it in. “When your body tells you it’s time, you need to listen,” said Dr. Fahmi Shibli, head of the neurogastroenterology unit at Emek Medical Center. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="b5vfo-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="b5vfo-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="b5vfo-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“The urge to go to the toilet is a natural response to nerve signals. If you ignore it repeatedly, you train your body to think it’s not the right time, and the brain stops sending those signals."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="5n7gq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5n7gq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5n7gq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Shibli explained that repeatedly postponing bowel movements disrupts the physiological connection between the gut and the brain. “It’s an entire neural pathway that begins at the end of the digestive tract and communicates with centers in the brain. When that pathway is damaged, the result is chronic constipation."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="cf7mk-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.BkgMgt099gg" id="image_ArticleImageData.BkgMgt099gg"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.BkgMgt099gg" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/06/11/rylRx11oLmgg/rylRx11oLmgg_0_0_1000_527_0_x-large.jpg" alt="התאפקות, עצירות" title="Postponing bowel movements disrupts gut-brain connection  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.BkgMgt099gg" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/06/11/rylRx11oLmgg/rylRx11oLmgg_0_0_1000_527_0_x-large.jpg" alt="התאפקות, עצירות" title="Postponing bowel movements disrupts gut-brain connection  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Postponing bowel movements disrupts gut-brain connection &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="f2ei2-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="f2ei2-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="f2ei2-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Delaying visits to the toilet affects people of all ages but often starts early, Shibli said - children who are embarrassed to use the school bathroom, soldiers who cannot relieve themselves in the field, or employees who prefer to “wait until they get home.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="aepua-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="aepua-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="aepua-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Women, he added, suffer more often, partly because of greater sensitivity about hygiene and embarrassment around the subject.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="dm553-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="dm553-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dm553-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Not all cases of holding it in involve embarrassment. Sometimes it stems from fear of pain caused by conditions such as fissures, hemorrhoids or other discomfort, Shibli noted. “That only makes the problem worse,” he explained. “Any such pain requires evaluation and treatment, or else, it creates a 'vicious cycle' of constipation, bleeding and hemorrhoids.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="64l6k-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="64l6k-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="64l6k-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Parents, he said, need to teach their children not to be ashamed. “You have to talk to them, notice if they’re holding it in, and tell them it’s OK to ask to go, that it’s not embarrassing. It’s essential.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="4l1s8-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4l1s8-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4l1s8-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;As for adults, he says, “There’s nothing unusual here. Don’t hold it in just because you have one more email to answer at work. You’re harming your body and training it to stop asking."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="24rno-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="24rno-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="24rno-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;* Listen to your body and go to the toilet as soon as you feel the urge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="cng7j-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cng7j-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cng7j-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;* Drink plenty of water to soften stool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="43k0b-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="43k0b-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="43k0b-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;* Eat fiber-rich foods such as vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="3e8im-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3e8im-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3e8im-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;* Don’t fear or feel disgusted by the subject - it’s natural and important&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="brcr3" data-offset-key="eampf-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="eampf-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="eampf-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Sometimes, the solution starts with caffeine. “Coffee stimulates the digestive system,” Shibli said. “It contains not just caffeine but also compounds that activate nerve pathways in the intestines.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;By age 40, more than half of Americans have high blood pressure, but many are unaware of it. Hypertension has long been known as the silent killer. When it's left untreated it can be deadly. And it's considered a silent threat since most people have no symptoms. You can't feel the pressure in your blood vessels increasing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;New&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356" target="_blank"&gt; recommendations&lt;/a&gt; from the American Heart Association aim for &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/new-high-blood-pressure-guideline-emphasizes-prevention-early-treatment-to-reduce-cvd-risk" target="_blank"&gt;early treatment&lt;/a&gt;, including lifestyle changes and medications, once systolic blood pressure rises above 130/80 mm Hg, (which stands for millimeters of mercury, a measure of pressure). Experts say it's clear that the sooner you take action, the more you can protect yourself. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Hypertension is a leading cause of heart disease, which is the&lt;a href="http://cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#:~:text=Heart%20disease%20is%20the%20leading,lost%20productivity%20due%20to%20death." target="_blank"&gt; #1 cause of death of both men and women&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. High blood pressure also increases the risk of kidney disease and dementia. And, research shows that hypertension can lead to damage in small blood vessels in the brain, which is linked to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's a really enormous preventive health opportunity in treating hypertension earlier," says &lt;a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8561973" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jordana Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, a nephrologist and hypertension specialist at the University of Pennsylvania. She says millions of adults in the U.S. could benefit from medications and lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you catch it early, and treat it early, you can end up with many more years of healthy life expectancy," Cohen says, pointing to a reduced risk of heart attacks, strokes, kidney damage and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new guidelines point to decades old advice about the benefits of a low-sodium diet, which can be challenging to follow, given &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/07/nx-s1-5495308/ultra-processed-food-upf-rfk-cdc#:~:text=Ultra%2Dprocessed%20foods%20still%20make,:%20Shots%20%2D%20Health%20News%20:%20NPR" target="_blank"&gt;more than half the calories&lt;/a&gt; consumed in the U.S. come from ultra-processed foods, which tend to be high in salt.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new guidelines also emphasize lifestyle strategies including exercise, limiting alcohol consumption, and stress reduction in the form of meditation, yoga, or deep breathing. For people with systolic blood pressure ( the upper number) in the 130s, the recommendation is to start with these diet and lifestyle-related changes, then move to medication if blood pressure doesn't improve.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For people who hit the risky range of a systolic blood pressure of 140 or higher, which is considered stage 2 hypertension, evidence shows starting on high blood pressure medications is beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For all people with a blood pressure over 140/ 90, mm Hg, we recommend beginning with two medications," Dr. Dan Jones, chair of the guideline writing committee at the Heart Association, told NPR. Research shows one medication alone is often not enough to lower blood pressure to the optimal range, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Jones says even when people are aware they have hypertension, more than half don't manage to lower it to the normal range, which is 120 /80 mm Hg or lower. Some of the challenges include side effects of the medications and individual differences in how well the medication works, as well an unwillingness to take medicines among some people. In addition, some people struggle the everyday hurdles of making lifestyle changes. Jones points out that healthcare providers also use a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001191" target="_blank"&gt;risk calculator&lt;/a&gt; to estimate a person's individual risk of heart disease, as part of a treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When George Solomon was told about the risks of high blood pressure he was hesitant to take medications. "I felt fine," he says. Then, at age 63, he had a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solomon had retired from a career in law enforcement, and was settling into a new routine, making time for exercise and hobbies, such as splitting wood on his farm. One day in the spring of 2023, he started to feel off.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" I went upstairs to watch TV, and when I sat down in the chair, I couldn't get back up. I had a sensation that came up across my back," he recalls and he lost feeling in his arm and leg. An ambulance took him to Duke University Hospital, near his home, where he underwent treatment and rehab for a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He estimates that he's now about 80% recovered, and back to exercising and working on his farm. He realizes now that he needs healthy lifestyle habits and medications to prevent another stroke.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" I feel I'm on the right path ," he says. He's lost weight and he's doing more cardio and strength training. He's sharing his story in hopes it encourages others to take action.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medications: what's out there, what's coming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are several types of medications used to treat hypertension. They include diuretics that help the body get rid of extra salt and water, ACE inhibitors that help block the production of a hormone called angiotensin II, and help relax the blood vessels and calcium channel blockers that &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22316-calcium-channel-blockers" target="_blank"&gt;slow down the movement of calcium into cells&lt;/a&gt;, which can help lower pressure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But many people with hypertension don't get enough reduction with current medications, and University of Pennsylvania's Cohen says there's a lot of interest in a new class of medication that works by targeting the hormone aldosterone, which helps regulate fluid and sodium in the body. Too much of the hormone is one cause of high blood pressure. The drug is not yet on the market, but new study results could pave the way for a new treatment option.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In hypertension, we haven't seen anything new that's effective since the nineties," Cohen says. So another tool in the toolkit for treatment could be beneficial, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A study &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2507109" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine found the aldosterone blocking drug, known as baxdrostat, was effective in lowering blood pressure in many people who have difficulty controlling their hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study included about 800 people who, despite taking two or three medications, still had not lowered their blood pressure to the normal range. "What we saw is that after 12 weeks of treatment, there was about a ten point improvement in blood pressure in the patients treated with baxdrostat, over the placebo effect, Dr. Jennifer Brown, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who is one of the researchers behind the study, told NPR. The study was sponsored by drugmaker Astra Zeneca, which plans to &lt;a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2025/baxdrostat-demonstrated-statistically-significant-clinically-meaningful-reduction-sbp-patients-hard-control-hypertension-baxhtn-phase-iii-trial.html" target="_blank"&gt;share its data&lt;/a&gt; with regulatory authorities by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A 10 point drop in systolic blood pressure is linked to about a 20% reduction in the risk of heart attacks and strokes, and also a decreased risk of dementia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            Edward Mowery&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;lived with excruciating pain for years: Picture being put into a hot frying pan, he said, and then someone holding you down on that pan forever. The fiery, shooting pain got so bad that he quit his job, stopped playing sports and had to abandon his beloved death metal band just as the group was taking off.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0002336nltj4gub3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At one point, I didn’t have any feeling in my arms or hands or anything,” said Mowery, 55, who lives in New Mexico. “I couldn’t put one note on a guitar, much less play like I do.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0003336njik3uz57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But everything changed when doctors tried a cutting-edge approach to pain management. If they can refine the technique to make it less intrusive and demonstrate that it works on others, doctors think this technique could radically transform the way people manage debilitating and otherwise untreatable chronic pain — no opioids or pain blockers required.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf3cdhuw00013b6ql4jg0a0b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The state of the art right now for picking a medication for an individual patient is trial and error” when it comes to pain, said &lt;a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/providers/prasad-shirvalkar" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Prasad Shirvalkar,&lt;/a&gt; a neurologist at the University of California San Francisco. “Trying to be your own guinea pig, that’s essentially what we’re doing right now in pain medicine.” Finding something more precise that could stop a pain signal in the brain before it could be felt in the body would be a huge shift.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0004336nnq26ipeo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7215a1.htm#:~:text=Chronic%20pain%20(i.e.%2C%20pain%20lasting%20%E2%89%A53%20months)%20is,pain%20surveillance%20data%20(7)." target="_blank"&gt;50 million adults&lt;/a&gt; in the United States experience chronic pain, defined as lasting for more than three months. Of them, about 8.5% are like Mowery, living with chronic pain that interferes with day-to-day life, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7215a1.htm#:~:text=CDC%20analyzed%20data%20from%20the,experienced%20high%2Dimpact%20chronic%20pain." target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0005336nk0xbmr40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mowery says he was a rambunctious kid and got injured a lot while skiing and playing soccer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0006336n0ydza4oo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Altogether he says he’s had 34 surgeries, including 11 painful knee surgeries, as well as foot, back and neck surgeries. The bigger problem, though, started with a part of his body that hadn’t even been injured.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0007336nh8x1jdxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About a week after a routine knee replacement in 2009, his right foot started to feel like it was on fire.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf3cfa2s00033b6qlj8cjssh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He spoke with “all kind of doctors, trying to figure out what was going on,” but nobody could explain the pain. Some didn’t even believe that he was in pain, assuming he was an opioid addict looking for pills. “That’s the one thing, when they put me on all these meds, I wasn’t addicted to all the meds, I was addicted to getting rid of the pain,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0008336nqaoyvnmj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For eight long years, he said, doctors couldn’t figure out what was causing the pain. But in 2017, when his foot turned purple and black, he went to a pain specialist in Albuquerque who took one look and told him he had complex regional pain syndrome, or CRPS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0009336nrqkamk7d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CRPS is a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crps-complex-regional-pain-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20371151" target="_blank"&gt;kind of neurological&lt;/a&gt; pain, often in the extremities, that can develop after a surgery, stroke, injury or heart attack that is out of proportion to the severity of an initial injury. It can make blood vessels dilate or constrict, leading to skin discoloration, swelling and temperature changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000a336nwbujq0mg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mowery says doctors explained that when the acute pain from his knee went away, his brain essentially missed that feeling.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000b336n47hzf0oz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Because I’d been in pain for so long, my brain was so used to being in pain that it said, ‘Oh, you need to have this back,’ ” he said. “Manufactured pain from the brain with no stimulus. It’s unreal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000d336n9nf72hap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors put him on a variety of pain medications, including morphine and oxycodone, that he didn’t like because he felt so out of it. At one point, he took 17 pills&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a day, but nothing worked for long. Always athletic, Mowery ended up relying on a walker or a wheelchair to get around﻿.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000e336nzkwj4749@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really depressing. You would think they’d call CRPS the suicide disease,” Mowery said. “A lot of times, I was sitting there just going, ‘what am I going to do? There’s nothing out there for me.’ “
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000f336n55d8sui1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He spent years searching the internet for clinical trials and finally found one at the &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.ucsf.edu/complex-regional-pain-syndrome" target="_blank"&gt;University of California San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;. The description of the research seemed vague but he filled out the questionnaire anyway and, within 40 minutes, he said, he got a message urgently asking him to come to San Francisco.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000g336nj1fv360i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Relief from his years of agony would soon come after doctors persuaded him to let them drill several holes in his head.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000i336n53tp9dpk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Shirvalkar says he has long wanted to solve the puzzle that is pain. He had success treating neurological conditions but less success treating their chronic pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000j336ny7sk3osl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are people that have been failed by all available therapies. They’ve tried over 25 different medications. They have had multiple injections and nerve blocks.&lt;br&gt;They’ve even had spinal cord stimulators or peripheral stimulators, and nothing can alleviate their suffering,” Shirvalkar said. “We started appreciating that the brain must be generating or perpetuating these pain signals in a person. So the question becomes, how can we identify what these signals are and really try to suppress or short-circuit them?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000k336nt8q95cgg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acute pain, like when someone stubs a toe, affects the brain differently from chronic pain, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000l336nz8ffq1oi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think of chronic pain as a fire alarm. The alarm is helpful for acute pain. We want to be able to know when there’s an emergency,” he said. “In chronic pain, it’s as if the fire alarm is going off, but we can’t identify the fire.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000m336ntcsrk4b8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When pain becomes chronic, it rewires the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000n336nwajlih0t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It starts to take on these other dimensions that include mood and motivation and involve attention and memory, and so we really have to address the cognitive aspect of it,” Shirvalkar said. “It tells me that when someone has developed chronic pain, treating it with a single drug or injection or some monotherapy probably isn’t going to work.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000o336nozb470wh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With the help of a $7.56 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, Shirvalkar and a team at UCSF have been exploring &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/deep-brain-stimulation/about/pac-20384562" target="_blank"&gt;deep brain stimulation&lt;/a&gt;, a technology sometimes used with people who have Parkinson’s disease, to treat pain conditions like Mowery’s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000p336n3gw7kjmf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With Parkinson’s, doctors implant electrodes in the brain that produce electrical impulses to disrupt the abnormal signals that cause tremors, stiffness and slow movement. Shirvalkar wondered if they could also use the a version of the device to redirect or suppress the brain’s pain signals to the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000q336n0imd0qt3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were a few challenges with this approach. The device sends signals around the clock in someone who has Parkinson’s, but Shirvalkar thought a constant signal wouldn’t work for chronic pain because the brain can become acclimated to the impulses and essentially override them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000r336n8go3iat6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another challenge was figuring out what part of the brain was sending pain signals.&lt;br&gt;There’s no one central location that does this, and it could be different in different people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000s336nht0x1lb3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet another challenge would be to quickly sense when the brain was about to send out a pain signal – or even anticipate it – and shut it down quickly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000t336nour7em6d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The team used computational models and AI to essentially detect a biomarker that could track how severe a person’s chronic pain would be, similar to how an A1C level can tell whether someone has diabetes and how severe it is.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000u336n61kdkkqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But to learn whether deep brain stimulation could work for pain, the team first had to persuade Mowery that he should have another surgery. He was reluctant to have another procedure. This trial would require three.
    &lt;/p&gt;





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000v336nh5r2h5l4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It took Mowery about 18 months to decide the trial was right for him – time in which the worsening pain essentially wore him down.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000w336nv9uxvdk5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the first surgery, doctors would map Mowery’s brain to determine where the pain came from. Another surgery would remove the temporary probes from the first procedure. A final procedure placed permanent probes in the correct areas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000x336n14blzlb7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the first part of the trial, Mowery spent 10 days in the hospital while doctors created a grid of more than 100 points on his head to try to find different circuits or certain activation for pain by watching and stimulating his brain. Even with eight- to 10-hour days probing his brain, it wasn’t until day five or six that the researchers had their “eureka moment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000y336n7qs30a2h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All of a sudden, Ed says, ‘Wow, my pain just washed off of me,’ ” Shirvalkar said. “I was blown away. I didn’t know what to say.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv000z336no3jsng0d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Concerned that it could be the placebo effect, the doctors kept testing to make sure they had the right targets. Shirvalkar quickly became confident that they had picked the right areas when Mowery&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;immediately felt the pain in his feet, legs and lower back dissipate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0010336ni6ns5086@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When it comes to actually understanding what’s driving someone’s chronic pain, we say there’s no pain center, right? But it tells us if chronic pain is this complex lock, it tells us that yes, that there is a key to be found. So it gives us hope.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0011336nkebbazkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Much more research will be done to see if this technology can work for everyone or whether there would be even better technology that would be less invasive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0012336n73vanbcn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In August, Shirvalkar and his team &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.11.25333010v1" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; the results of their tests of this technique on six people. The team followed the patients for 22 months and were even able to randomize the trial so some got the stimulation and some did not. Those who got stimulation reported a reduction in pain of about 60%, while the placebo group got no such relief.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0013336ny5uk6pb2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mowery has resumed his normal daily activities, including playing his guitar. He can monitor what’s going on in his brain with an iPad app and just has to periodically charge the device that sends the signals to his brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf34e62j00023b6q3mcwjbg4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He’s not totally pain-free, he says: He’ll have a bad day sometimes, but it’s infrequent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf34emfl00043b6qt9bgfvpr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He says Shirvalkar’s work changed his life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0014336nibiqkgof@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The way it detected pain, the way it turns off pain, the way I’m getting off all these medications, I feel like I owe him my life,” Mowery said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0015336nx5jcpwir@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mowery felt so much better that, in June, he &lt;a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/news-events/blog/congressional-briefing-highlights-brain-initiative-research-addiction" target="_blank"&gt;accompanied Shirvalkar&lt;/a&gt; to Washington to testify before Congress’&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience Caucus about the impact of the NIH BRAIN Initiative on addiction research and on this pain treatment alternative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf34frk500063b6qz2dgn0un@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Shirvalkar is concerned about future funding amid the current political environment and other funding cuts at the NIH.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf339tsv0016336n8chdi69f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “NIH funding is always a concern. Fortunately, we’re doing OK for the time being,” Shirvalkar said. “We’ll have to wait and see.”

&lt;p&gt;A small tick bite can be all it takes for a person to contract an allergy that makes it nearly impossible to consume red meats. Doctors in the Twin Lakes area and around the state are seeing an increase in patients reporting the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition, known as alpha-gal syndrome, has doubled in Arkansas over the last twenty years and those who have develop negative effects to ingesting meat from mammals including hives or itchy rash, swelling of lips, face, or eyelids, stomach pain, cough wheezing or shortness of breath. In a study of 3,000 U.S. military recruits tested for alpha-gal syndrome, 39 percent of those whose home of record was Arkansas were sensitized, proving to be the highest percentage of any state. Oklahoma followed at 35 percent, and Missouri at 29 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alison Humphrey from Mountain Home ENT &amp;amp; Allergy clinic reports she has seen an increase in patients showing symptoms. With summer’s heat ending and more locals spending time outside she shares how the disease can be transmitted through the small insects.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increased push for reporting around the state is bringing more light to the condition according to Dr. Humphrey.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the allergy can improve or disappear over time, steps can be taken early in a diagnosis to lessen the effects of the symptoms.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerned individuals that may be showing symptoms can receive a simple blood test from their primary health care provider. While there is no preventive vaccine for alpha gal syndrome taking preventive steps can help avoid the condition. When outdoors avoid tall brushy grasses where the lone star tick often lays in wait, use appropriate insect repellents and where long clothing when in the woods and always thoroughly check for ticks after spending time outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

A few of these journeys are as raw, honest, and inspiring as Sania Gupta's. In 2023, she weighed 102 kg and was battling more than just extra weight. PCOS, acne, hair loss, frequent headaches, and the emotional scars of fat-shaming had taken over her life. Even walking for 5 minutes brought unbearable leg pain. But, what she did not do was, give up! Instead, Sania chose to turn her struggles into strength. Her journey, which brought her down to 52 kg, is not just about numbers on the scale but about reclaiming health, dignity, and joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sania shares how the pain in her legs kept her awake at night. This pain, rather than breaking her, became the turning point. Unlike many who start their journeys with external goals, like fitting into clothes or following trends, Sania began hers out of sheer necessity. Her body was asking for help, and she listened. The truth here is important: real transformations begin not with vanity but with survival. Sania’s first victory was not losing weight but deciding she deserved better health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Quitting sugar and overeating&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her changes were not dramatic, but deeply consistent. She quit sugar, stopped overeating, and gradually started walking. These sound like familiar tips, but the truth is different; most people give up because they expect instant results. Sania’s story shows that when the body is in pain, small, simple decisions carry the most power. Quitting sugar helped her control PCOS symptoms, while mindful eating reduced stress on her digestion. The lesson here is that healing begins when food stops being the enemy and becomes medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you think small, gradual changes are more effective than drastic diets for weight loss?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sania’s transformation wasn’t about crash diets. She restructured her meals with mindful swaps. Sugary drinks became fruit-infused water, fried snacks gave way to roasted makhana, and refined grains were replaced by millets and whole grains. She didn’t stop eating; she simply chose differently. The truth behind these swaps lies in science: high-fibre foods balance blood sugar, while wholesome snacks prevent the cycle of cravings. Instead of cutting out entire food groups, Sania added healthier options that nurtured her body. This sustainable shift is why her weight loss has lasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing 50 kilos changed more than her appearance. Today, Sania treks, climbs, and takes part in activities she once thought impossible. For someone who once struggled to walk, hiking trails now represent freedom. The truth here is powerful: fitness is not about a smaller body, but about gaining a bigger life. Her journey is proof that transformation is measured not just in kilos but in experiences, laughing on treks, standing tall on mountain peaks, and reclaiming spaces she was once excluded from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sania maintains her weight loss through five essential habits: following the 80/20 rule in eating, walking 7k–10k steps daily, staying hydrated with 3–4 litres of water, prioritising 6–8 hours of sleep, and practising light activity even on rest days. While these habits sound straightforward, their truth lies in discipline. They are not short-term tricks but lifelong commitments. Sania proves that weight loss is not the end of the journey, it is the beginning of a healthier rhythm of living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is based on Sania Gupta’s personal weight loss journey, as shared in her social media posts. The steps, food swaps, and lifestyle changes mentioned worked for her but may not be suitable for everyone. Weight loss depends on individual health conditions, and it is always best to consult a doctor or nutritionist before making major changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 10:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>女人醒来时舌头有奇怪的感觉，然后半张脸停止工作（独家） - AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/woman-wakes-strange-feeling-her-100000718.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savannah Mares&lt;/p&gt; Savannah Mares, split image.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It started when Savannah Mares-Sedillo's tongue went numb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She then lost feeling in part of her face and rushed to the emergency room&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mares-Sedillo was eventually diagnosed with Bell's Palsy, which was believed to be brought on by stress&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vanbam16" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Savannah Mares-Sedillo;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Savannah Mares-Sedillo&lt;/a&gt; didn’t think anything of it when she noticed that part of her tongue felt a bit numb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days later, the actress and model woke up to a strange feeling in other parts of her face. She felt a burning sensation in her eyes and her face began twitching. Still, Mares-Sedillo went to work and tried to go about her day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was filming auditions and kept powering through. That night, I started to feel sick," she tells PEOPLE. "I wrote it off that morning. I woke up at 6:00 a.m 'cause I had to film an audition that was due at 10 a.m."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That morning I woke up and I was like, my lips feel a little weird and my eye feels a little weird,” she recalls,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savannah Mares&lt;/p&gt; Savannah Mares after Bell's Palsy diagnosis.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audition she was filming was particularly physically demanding, requiring running and other action. When she was done, however, she says half of her face stopped working. When she tried to smile, only one side responded, while the other didn't budge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mares-Sedillo took a video and sent it to her mom, asking if it was normal. Her mom warned that it may be a sign of a stroke, which runs in their family. Mares-Sedillo immediately called a medical professional for advice and drove herself to urgent care as her eye seemingly got worse by the minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she got there, however, the receptionist told her that they didn’t take her insurance and that there was “nothing they could do” if she was having a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was advised to go to a nearby emergency room, so she got back in her car. When she arrived, she explained her symptoms to a nurse. Fearing she was in fact having a stroke, they took her in and immediately began running tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they were able to rule out a stroke, they found out that she had a double ear infection and believed she had Bell’s Palsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition causes &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bells-palsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370028#:~:text=Bell's%20palsy%20is%20a%20condition,the%20affected%20side%20resists%20closing." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sudden weakness or paralysis in muscles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sudden weakness or paralysis in muscles&lt;/a&gt; on one side of the face and is, in most cases, temporary, according to the Mayo Clinic. While it can be diagnosed after physical examination, there are no tests to confirm the diagnosis. The exact cause is also unknown, but it is believed to be related to inflammation in the facial nerve, potentially due to viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not knowing much about the condition, Mares-Sedillo worried that her face would be permanently altered. However, her doctor assured her that she was lucky they caught it early, but it could still take months to heal. They suggested it could have been due to stress, which can be a trigger, as it may weaken the immune system and increase inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her doctor prescribed her four different medications, including two different antibiotics and a strong steroid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her acting and modeling career on pause amid her recovery, Mares-Sedillo wanted to find something to fill her days, while also documenting any changes in her face. She decided to turn to TikTok, where she shared videos about her condition and connected with other people who have Bell’s Palsy, some of whom recommended she try acupuncture as an additional treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her diagnosis, Mares-Sedillo felt alone, but found out quickly that there is a robust community on TikTok that could offer help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After the first couple of videos of me talking about my experience, I started to realize how many people have had this. I didn't realize it was such a big thing that so many people had struggled with,” Mares-Sedillo says. “I feel like it's been the most authentic I've been and in return the most I've been able to connect with people and talk about things that I actually care about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you have Bell's Palsy, a lot of people wanna hide that," she adds. "I have the sense of not going out physically with my friends, but it feels comfortable and a safe space to do it on TikTok.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through her TikTok videos and her community, Mares-Sedillo has been able to document her progress. People in the comments section often point out that they can see the difference in how her face is healing. Posting consistently has “kept [her] accountable" and has made a difference in how she feels day to day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savannah Mares&lt;/p&gt; Savannah Mares-Sedillo&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;I take my medications every day and keep up with my acupuncture and keep up with my videos because I want to show people that you can get better,” Mares-Sedillo shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her biggest takeaway from the community is that “no matter how specific you feel your situation is, there is always someone else also going through it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a community out there for you. Even through these dark times, you can keep pushing through and hopefully find something positive that can come out of it. Find the little things to help you get through the dark times, and it'll do a lot for your mental health,” Mares-Sedillo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-documents-recovery-from-bells-palsy-exclusive-11800765" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 10:10:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5WNDJ0U2RudjR2UTZVZW0wbmNpZ0ZnTVFyN3lUSGQ0LVAwOHpGR09SYVk0b3ZROVBpTjFLaENDYXdBOFRjc09zcHBSZGNrcDhmUmdXYkthdVhlQjczQXVDbVM5QXphRXVVeFBwNHcwMldnU0VE</guid></item><item><title>夏威夷的重大变化，政治冲突造成对新冠疫苗的困惑-檀香山Star-Advertiser</title><link>https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/09/07/hawaii-news/major-changes-political-conflict-create-confusion-over-covid-19-vaccines-in-hawaii/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hsa-paywall-content" class="hsa-paywall"&gt;
                                    &lt;p&gt;Due to changes in criteria and the ongoing upheaval in the regulatory agencies overseeing their uses and approvals, getting an updated COVID-19 vaccination this fall will differ from past years for those who are young and healthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccines are no longer broadly approved, as in past years, for anyone ages 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in late August approved the updated COVID-19 vaccines only for people ages 65 or older and for those younger only if they have one or more health conditions that put them at higher risk of severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a major shift from past guidance, resulting in confusion over who is eligible to get a vaccination and where to get them, what it will cost, and whether younger people will need to consult with their doctors to get the COVID-19 shots, which won’t necessarily be widely available in doctors’ offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s going to be harder,” said Dr. Scott Miscovich of Premier Medical Group Hawaii. “A major reason why, first of all, is finding these in your regular doctor’s offices is really going to be minimal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has not seen the price for the updated COVID-19 shots yet but said doctors have to consider how many to order. They will not want to spend money, for example, on a box of 10 at possibly $2,250 or more for an unknown number of patients, only to throw them out if unused.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another unknown, Miscovich said, is how strict insurance companies will be in evaluating whether younger people meet the criteria for a COVID-19 shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expects about 30% fewer Hawaii residents to get vaccinated than in past years due to the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail pharmacies at Longs Drugs, operated by CVS Health, are also offering the updated COVID-19 vaccines. CVS said Hawaii is one of 34 states that allow pharmacies to give vaccines that are FDA-approved. Appointments for the vaccines are available via its app and &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cvs.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other states, CVS said, are on hold pending authorization from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which is scheduled to meet Sept. 18 and 19. Yet other states will allow CVS to offer COVID-19 vaccines if presented with a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summer uptick &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suzanne Uratani, 75, of Honolulu, has already scheduled an appointment for a COVID-19 shot Monday at a Longs Drugs location. She suffers from adult-onset asthma and has gotten the vaccine and boosters since they were available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her partner, Ted, 78, is also scheduled for a COVID-19 shot. He was a longtime smoker before quitting in 2020, she said, and has a heart condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They take a multilayered approach, including masking outside of their home, to avoid getting COVID-19 due to these vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The couple are easily eligible due to their age, but questions linger over the process for younger residents who still want a COVID-19 shot. The CVS app, for now, appears to allow appointments for residents under 65 if self-­reporting a high-risk condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawaii, meanwhile, experienced a summer uptick in COVID-19 cases, with test positivity rates soaring to a high of 16.1% in early August compared to a low of 3.6% in early May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state Department of Health’s &lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019/current-situation-in-hawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;COVID-19 data dashboard&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday showed a test positivity rate of 13.7% for the week ending Sept. 1, indicating the virus is still circulating in the community at a medium level. Children were impacted, with CDC data showing a spike in COVID-19-related emergency department visits among patients 11 years and younger through August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miscovich said many COVID-19 patients came through his urgent-care clinics over the summer seeking treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This round, we had the razor sore throat,” he said. “A lot of upper respiratory congestion and coughing. They were symptoms that lasted for two to 2-1/2 weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflicting guidelines &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the federal approval process for COVID-19 vaccines over past years was routine, this year’s process is full of strife and disruption, with conflicting recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/05/27/breaking-news/cdc-drops-covid-vaccine-recommendation-for-kids-pregnant-women/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;announced on X &lt;/a&gt;that the government was dropping COVID-19 vaccine shots for healthy children and pregnant women from the immunization schedule, as the CDC subsequently did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a reputed vaccine skeptic, also fired all 17 members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, saying he did so to restore public trust. The committee’s recommendations affect insurance coverage for vaccines and usually become CDC policy upon adoption by the CDC director, who &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/08/27/breaking-news/cdc-chief-exits-after-weeks-in-role-three-top-officials-resign/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;was also recently fired&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in August, the FDA approved but placed age restrictions on the updated Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary posted to X that the new guidelines reflect a risk-tiered approach matching other countries such as Denmark and France, where COVID-19 vaccines are recommended only for older people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has also questioned whether younger children need boosters every year when the COVID-19 emergency is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional medical organizations, however, are countering the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services with differing recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/08/19/breaking-news/pediatricians-urge-covid-shots-for-kids-defying-cdc-guidance/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;all children&lt;/a&gt; ages 6 to 23 months old get the COVID-19 vaccine, along with older children in certain risk groups. The academy also said parents who want one for their child should be able to get one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AAP President Dr. Susan Kressly called the decision to limit the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine for children “deeply troubling,” saying it added further confusion and stress for parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said it &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/programs/immunization-infectious-disease-public-health/tools-and-resources/covid-19-vaccines-and-pregnancy-conversation-guide-for-clinicians#:~:text=The%20American%20College%20of%20Obstetricians,19%20vaccine%20or%20%E2%80%9Cbooster.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;continues to recommend&lt;/a&gt; all pregnant individuals receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;States divided &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conflict over COVID-19 vaccines has divided the nation, prompting some states to band together in support of science-backed vaccine policies, and others to set their own vaccine rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawaii on Thursday &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/09/04/breaking-news/hawaii-joins-west-care-health-alliance-to-form-own-policies/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;joined forces&lt;/a&gt; with the West Coast Health Alliance, comprising California, Oregon and Washington. Together the four states will, according to a news release, provide “evidence-based immunization guidance rooted in safety, efficacy, and transparency — ensuring residents receive credible information free from political interference.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts issued an order requiring insurers to cover the costs of COVID-19 shots, while Florida announced it will &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/09/03/breaking-news/florida-plans-to-end-all-vaccine-mandates-including-for-schools/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;end all state vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the alliance, HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon said in an emailed statement, “Democrat-run states that pushed unscientific school lockdowns, toddler mask mandates, and draconian vaccine passports during the COVID era completely eroded the American people’s trust in public health agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insurance coverage &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HMSA, one of Hawaii’s largest health insurance providers, said it will continue to cover COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“HMSA and professional medical societies around the world have concluded that COVID-19 vaccines are effective at keeping individuals and populations safe,” said Stefanie Park, HMSA chief medical officer, in a statement. “We believe that everyone in Hawaii who wants one should have access to one. Accordingly, HMSA will continue to cover COVID-19 vaccines without cost share for anyone over 6-months-old who desires one, in the same manner we cover it today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente said it is reviewing the FDA’s approval of this year’s COVID-19 vaccines and will also review the CDC’s clinical guidance when it is released, along with those of relevant medical societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccination continues to be one of the safest and most effective ways to protect against illness and reduce the severity of illness from COVID,” Kaiser said in a statement. “Kaiser Permanente is committed to making the 2025-26 COVID vaccine available at no cost to children and adults for protection from severe illness from COVID.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state Health Department also is monitoring developments but has not yet offered detailed recommendations on the vaccines to residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Department of Health updated its 24-25 COVID-19 vaccine recommendations in July based on updated evidence from the CDC’s COVID-19 vaccine workgroup,” said State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Kemble in a statement. “The DOH believes that all individuals aged 6 months or older who desire COVID vaccination should have access to it, and DOH encourages health plans to cover COVID vaccination without cost-sharing, even if it’s for an indication that the U.S. FDA has removed. We will continue to review new evidence as it becomes available and update our recommendations as indicated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added that DOH fully supports the governor’s commitment to making public health decisions based on sound science and evidence-based approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We look forward to collaborating with the other states in the West Coast Health Alliance to align guidance to best protect public health,” she said. “This shared effort will be useful to provide clear and consistent guidance, including for COVID recommendations for the upcoming 2025-26 vaccine formulations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest flagging &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when COVID-19 vaccines were widely available last fall, interest had dropped, with only 13.2% of the state’s population having received the 2024-25 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among youth, rates were even lower. About 12% of residents ages 12 to 17 received the COVID-19 vaccine, as did only 3% of residents ages 5 to 11 and a mere 0.7% of residents ages 6 months to 4 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miscovich is concerned for patients under 50 who have health risks. He noted the CDC criteria for high-­risk conditions are broad-­ranging and apply to many residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s list includes conditions such as asthma, cancer, COPD, heart conditions, diabetes, obesity, depression, pregnancy and physical inactivity, and people who are current or former smokers, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is recommending the COVID-19 vaccine to his patients, especially with the risk of long COVID still present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The COVID vaccination is absolutely safe; the data is crystal clear,” Miscovich said. “You should be looking at it as very similar to a flu vaccination. COVID is with us to stay, and it is not something you want to get.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;—&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FALL COVID-19 VACCINES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;Who is eligible?&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;Based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals:&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; People ages 65 and older.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; People ages 6 months to 64 years old with at least one underlying health condition that places them at higher risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; high-risk list&lt;/a&gt; includes people with asthma, cancer, COPD, heart conditions, diabetes, obesity or depression; those who are pregnant or physically inactive; and people who are current or former smokers, among others.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccine choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Moderna: FDA-approved for those 6 months of age and older with underlying health conditions and people age 65 and older.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Pfizer: FDA-approved for those age 5 and older with underlying health conditions and people age 65 and older.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Novavax: FDA-approved for those 12 years and older with underlying health conditions and people age 65 and older.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CVS/Longs Drugs, Walgreens and other retail pharmacies. CVS appointments can be scheduled via its app or &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cvs.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Kaiser expects to offer COVID-19 shots to members at its clinics in the next few weeks. Visit &lt;a href="https://kp.org/COVID" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;kp.org/COVID &lt;/a&gt;for updates.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Check with your doctor’s office to see if vaccines are available.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Differing recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in May said he was dropping recommendations that healthy children and pregnant women receive COVID-19 shots.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention no longer recommends routine COVID-19 vaccination for children.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends all children ages 6 to 23 months get vaccinated, as well as all older children ages 2 to 18 at high risk of severe COVID-19 or who have household contacts at high risk. AAP also recommends the vaccine for all children not in high-risk groups but whose guardians wish to have them vaccinated.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists strongly recommends pregnant women be vaccinated against COVID-19 and continues to recommend all pregnant and lactating individuals receive an updated vaccine or booster.&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                    &lt;/div&gt;

He assumed it was something minor - an eyelash, perhaps - but within days, his sight grew worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I went to an eye hospital in the city and I was diagnosed with ocular melanoma,' Jack told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The melanoma had popped my retina off.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation, injections, and laser treatment followed, and for years he lived with the effects - but little did he know, the cancer was silently spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This June, Jack was sitting beside his father Edward and girlfriend Ariana when doctors delivered the news no teenager should ever hear: the cancer had spread to his liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At 19 years old, Sydney mechanic Jack Clement is facing the unimaginable - a stage four cancer diagnosis that has changed everything&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jack's story began when he was 14, sitting in class at school, and noticed the vision in his right eye suddenly turn blurry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jack was then officially diagnosed with stage four metastatic uveal melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The oncologist said, judging by my scans, without treatment I'd have 12 months to live, and with treatment, maybe two years,' Jack recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Uveal melanoma - also called ocular melanoma - is the most common form of eye cancer in adults, but it is still considered rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike skin melanoma, it develops in the middle layer of the eye that produces pigment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors believe Jack's condition may be linked to his rare eye colouring - one hazel eye, one brown - combined with years of surfing under the harsh Australian sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because the cancer grows in a part of the body that can't be seen, it often goes undetected until it causes vision problems or spreads elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Jack's case, the disease spread to his liver - which happens in up to 95 per cent of patients whose ocular melanoma metastasises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say this is because the cancer cells travel through the bloodstream, and the liver acts as a filter for blood, trapping the cancer cells there. Once it has spread, the cancer is far more difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Through the hardest moments, Jack's partner Ariana has never left his side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common early symptoms can be subtle and easy to dismiss, such as blurred vision in one eye, loss of peripheral vision, or small 'floaters' and flashes of light in your sight line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some patients notice dark patches on the white of their eye or a change in the shape of their pupil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the disease is frequently picked up during a routine eye exam rather than through symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was just… numb,' Jack recalled when told about the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What else can you do? You've got to keep going.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Through the hardest moments, Ariana has never left his side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The couple have been together since school, and she has now given up her job as a preschool teacher to move in with Jack, his mother, and his little sister, Amelia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ariana's very helpful, always looking after me, making sure I'm keeping my fluids up, eating right, sticking to my diet,' Jack said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I spend time with her every day.

He assumed it was something minor - an eyelash, perhaps - but within days, his sight grew worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I went to an eye hospital in the city and I was diagnosed with ocular melanoma,' Jack told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The melanoma had popped my retina off.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation, injections, and laser treatment followed, and for years he lived with the effects - but little did he know, the cancer was silently spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This June, Jack was sitting beside his father Edward and girlfriend Ariana when doctors delivered the news no teenager should ever hear: the cancer had spread to his liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At 19 years old, Sydney mechanic Jack Clement is facing the unimaginable - a stage four cancer diagnosis that has changed everything&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jack's story began when he was 14, sitting in class at school, and noticed the vision in his right eye suddenly turn blurry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jack was then officially diagnosed with stage four metastatic uveal melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The oncologist said, judging by my scans, without treatment I'd have 12 months to live, and with treatment, maybe two years,' Jack recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Uveal melanoma - also called ocular melanoma - is the most common form of eye cancer in adults, but it is still considered rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike skin melanoma, it develops in the middle layer of the eye that produces pigment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors believe Jack's condition may be linked to his rare eye colouring - one hazel eye, one brown - combined with years of surfing under the harsh Australian sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because the cancer grows in a part of the body that can't be seen, it often goes undetected until it causes vision problems or spreads elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Jack's case, the disease spread to his liver - which happens in up to 95 per cent of patients whose ocular melanoma metastasises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say this is because the cancer cells travel through the bloodstream, and the liver acts as a filter for blood, trapping the cancer cells there. Once it has spread, the cancer is far more difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Through the hardest moments, Jack's partner Ariana has never left his side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common early symptoms can be subtle and easy to dismiss, such as blurred vision in one eye, loss of peripheral vision, or small 'floaters' and flashes of light in your sight line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some patients notice dark patches on the white of their eye or a change in the shape of their pupil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the disease is frequently picked up during a routine eye exam rather than through symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was just… numb,' Jack recalled when told about the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What else can you do? You've got to keep going.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Through the hardest moments, Ariana has never left his side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The couple have been together since school, and she has now given up her job as a preschool teacher to move in with Jack, his mother, and his little sister, Amelia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ariana's very helpful, always looking after me, making sure I'm keeping my fluids up, eating right, sticking to my diet,' Jack said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I spend time with her every day. We walk the dog, watch television, hang out. I couldn't ask for more.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jack says Amelia, just eight years old, only knows that her big brother is 'a bit unwell'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family has shielded her from the full truth - a choice Jack admits is heartbreaking but necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's hard for a little kid to experience something like that,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jack is currently on an experimental treatment indefinitely which leaves him feeling exhausted and unable to work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jack is currently on an experimental treatment indefinitely which leaves him feeling exhausted and unable to work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, he makes an effort to visit colleagues and go for walks around the block or at the beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't really want to be rotting in bed,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You just gotta keep active in this sort of situation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A strict diet has also become part of his daily fight: no sugar, no fast food, no processed meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, he fills his plate with fresh vegetables, fruit, chicken, and red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-jack-fight-stage-4-liver-cancer"&gt;GoFundMe has now been set up to ease the financial burden on Jack &lt;/a&gt;and his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Donations will help cover urgent medical treatments, travel, living costs, and care for the family who have put their lives on hold to spend time with Jack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite the prognosis, Jack refuses to let cancer define him and is grateful for the support from his friends and family &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the prognosis, Jack refuses to let cancer define him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My friends and my family have been more than I could ever ask for, support-wise,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Everyone's staying strong for me.

I don’t have a sense of who I am. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc Pierrat’s mind once ran as smoothly as the gears on his endurance bike. He was a mechanical engineer by training and a marathoner for fun, a guy who maintained complicated systems at work and a meticulously organized garage at his Westlake Village home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years after his diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia, Marc’s thoughts are a jumble he can’t sort out alone. Once-routine tasks are now incomprehensible; memories swirl and slip away. His wife, Julia Pierrat, 58, shepherds Marc, 59, through meals and naptime, ensures he is clean and comfortable, gently offers names and words he can’t find himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often impossible for a person to talk about the internal experience of living with FTD, either because they can’t accurately assess their internal state or don’t have the language to describe it. In many cases the disease attacks the brain’s language centers directly. In others, a common symptom is &lt;a class="link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2957481/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;loss of insight&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the ability to recognize that anything is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But minds can unwind in a million different ways. In Marc’s case, the disease has taken a path that for now has preserved his ability to talk about life with what one doctor called “the most difficult of all neurologic diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;div class="video-enhancement" data-vertical data-video-disable-history&gt;   &lt;div class="video-enhancement-player"&gt;    &lt;gn-video-player class="gvp block relative  aspect-[9/16] overflow-hidden  w-full bg-cms-color-brand-background lg:z-10" data-video-player data-video-authors="Corinne Purtill" data-video-id="00000199-1b69-d0d7-afd9-df7d3b250000" data-video-platform="gvp" data-video-title="A Different Dementia: Understanding FTD and Its Impact" data-internal-video-id="00000199-1b66-dfcb-afbf-fbee534b0000" data-player-id="fe1b823c1080e49278d37020ad8e01979" data-autoplay-threshold="50" data-vertical data-lazy-offset="1.0"&gt; &lt;div class="container"&gt; &lt;div data-vjs-player class="video-js  vjs-9-16  skin bg-transparent"&gt; &lt;video playsinline="playsinline" loop preload="none" title="A Different Dementia: Understanding FTD and Its Impact" data-video-id="00000199-1b69-d0d7-afd9-df7d3b250000"&gt;  &lt;source src="https://ca-times-cdn.platform.californiatimes.com/32/f6/a05e1b2d4317aa8d8c58f6aa6dd5/apple-hls/250905-ftd.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;  &lt;source src="https://ca-times-cdn.platform.californiatimes.com/32/f6/a05e1b2d4317aa8d8c58f6aa6dd5/apple-hls/250905-ftd-custom-avc-9x16-720p-29-97fps-2000kbps-automatic.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;  &lt;source src="https://ca-times-cdn.platform.californiatimes.com/32/f6/a05e1b2d4317aa8d8c58f6aa6dd5/apple-hls/250905-ftd-custom-avc-9x16-720p-29-97fps-3500kbps-automatic.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;  &lt;source src="https://ca-times-cdn.platform.californiatimes.com/32/f6/a05e1b2d4317aa8d8c58f6aa6dd5/apple-hls/250905-ftd-custom-avc-9x16-540p-29-97fps-2500kbps-automatic.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;  &lt;source src="https://ca-times-cdn.platform.californiatimes.com/32/f6/a05e1b2d4317aa8d8c58f6aa6dd5/apple-hls/250905-ftd-custom-avc-9x16-360p-29-97fps-600kbps-automatic.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;  &lt;source src="https://ca-times-cdn.platform.californiatimes.com/32/f6/a05e1b2d4317aa8d8c58f6aa6dd5/file-group/250905-ftd-custom-generic-hd-mp4-av1-aac-16x9-720x1280p-30hz-2mbps-qvbr-vq7.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;   &lt;/video&gt;         &lt;div data-element="gvp-share-container" class="lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:z-10 lg:w-full"&gt;  &lt;ps-actionbar data-element="action-bar" class="font-cms-font-service-text  ct-hidden action-bar-video h-10 w-full top-0"&gt; &lt;ul data-element="action-bar-menu" class="flex gap-2 list-none  absolute w-full h-10 top-0"&gt;       &lt;li data-element="action-bar-share" class="flex  w-full h-10 top-0 lg:items-center lg:justify-center "&gt; &lt;button data-element="action-link" class="flex absolute right-2.5 top-2.5 z-25 border-0 hover:!bg-transparent  bg-transparent cursor-pointer" aria-label="Share" data-modal-trigger&gt; &lt;svg class="icon flex items-center justify-center p-1 text-[#fff]  pointer-events-none"&gt; &lt;use xlink:href="#share-more-arrow-solid"&gt;&lt;/use&gt; &lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/button&gt; &lt;div data-element="action-bar-content" class="ct-hidden"&gt; &lt;p data-element="action-bar-overlay" class="fixed inset-0 z-1050 bg-cms-color-brand-background opacity-50" data-modal-close&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div data-element="action-bar-modal" class="p-2.5 fixed w-full left-0 right-0 bottom-0 z-1050 bg-cms-page-color-background rounded-t-lg lg:relative lg:shadow-none  lg:max-w-35   lg:p-5 lg:rounded-lg"&gt; &lt;p data-element="action-bar-modal-header" class="relative flex justify-between mb-2.5 text-base text-cms-color-brand-text lg:text-xs"&gt; &lt;span&gt;Share via&lt;/span&gt; &lt;button data-element="share-close-button" class="absolute flex p-0 top-0 right-0 justify-center align-center bg-transparent border-0 lg:-top-2.5 lg:-right-2.5 cursor-pointer" data-modal-close&gt; &lt;svg class="icon close-icon h-3 w-3 fill-cms-color-icon-brand hover:fill-cms-color-icon-service"&gt; &lt;use xlink:href="#close-x"&gt;&lt;/use&gt; &lt;/svg&gt; &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Close extra sharing options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/button&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/ps-actionbar&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/gn-video-player&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people in the U.S. live with FTD. Marc can speak for only one of them, and at times he does so with clarity that breaks his wife’s heart. Occasionally Julia records snippets of conversation with his permission, mementos from a stage of marriage they never saw coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It feels like walking into a closet you haven’t been in in a while, and you’re looking for something that you know is there, but you don’t know where,” Marc said recently, as Julia looked on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then, you know, you just — yeah. You just give up,” he concluded. “It’s the giving up part that’s hard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;

Like, if you’re going to catch a ball, you know, you have the ball in the air, [and] you have to raise your arm and your glove, and you catch the ball. And FTD interferes with all of that. So it makes it harder to catch the ball. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;More than 6 million people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. currently live with dementia, an umbrella term for conditions affecting memory, language and other cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 90% of dementia cases are caused by Alzheimer’s disease, the progressive memory disorder, or by strokes and other vascular problems that disrupt blood flow to the brain. The rest arise from a variety of lesser-known but equally devastating conditions.

   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In FTD, abnormal proteins accumulate in the brain’s frontal or temporal lobes, damaging and eventually destroying those neurons. It’s frequently misdiagnosed, and so the number of current U.S. cases is hard to pin down — estimates place it between 50,000 and 250,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By far the best-known person living with FTD is the actor Bruce Willis, whose family &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.theaftd.org/mnlstatement23/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;disclosed his diagnosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Willis has primary progressive aphasia, the second-most common form. In his case, the most damaged tissues are in his brain’s left frontal or left temporal lobes, which play crucial roles in processing and forming language. One of his first noticeable symptoms was a stutter, his wife Emma Heming Willis has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAnrCO0S1do" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said in interviews&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; he now has minimal language ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But FTD is highly heterogeneous, meaning that symptoms vary widely, and it has affected Marc and Willis in very different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease has several subtypes based on where the degeneration begins its advance through the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-right&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pierrat has the most common subtype, behavioral variant FTD. His disease has targeted his frontal lobes, which manage social behavior, emotional regulation, impulse control, planning and working memory — essentially, everything a person needs to relate to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FTD typically presents between the ages of 45 and 60. Because it shows up so much earlier than other dementias, its initial symptoms are often mistaken for other conditions: depression, perimenopause, Parkinson’s disease, psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything we think and do and say to one another depends on very specific physical locations in our brains functioning correctly. Behavioral variant FTD strikes right at the places that house our personalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an eloquent person suddenly can’t form sentences, it’s typically seen as a medical problem. But when an empathetic person suddenly withholds affection, it’s perceived as an act of unkindness. The truth is that both can be the product of physical deterioration in a previously healthy brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;hr class="divider"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you were to describe to another person what it’s like to live with FTD, how would you describe it?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oh my God. . . . Well, you can’t assess situations accurately. You see a train coming, and it’s gonna smash into your car, and you’d be, like, ‘Oh. Huh. That train’s gonna hit my car.’ And there’s nothing you can do.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first sign came in late 2018. Marc, then 52, was in a fender-bender a few blocks from home and called Julia for a ride. When she arrived, he was not just surprised to see her, but angry. Why was she there? Who’d asked her to come?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was taken aback by his forgetfulness, and more so by his hostility. Marc could be stubborn and confrontational; over the decades, they’d argued as much as any couple. But this outburst was out of character. She chalked it up to nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc was a respected project manager in the pharmaceutical industry. He spent weekends on home improvement projects or immersed in his many hobbies: hiking, woodworking, 100-mile bike races.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-right&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

Their daughter was pursuing a doctorate at UCLA. The couple enjoyed life as empty nesters with shared passions for road trips and camping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a year or two after the accident, nothing happened that couldn’t be dismissed as a normal midlife memory lapse or a cranky mood. But by late 2020, something had undeniably changed. The harsh parts of Marc’s personality ballooned to bizarre proportions, smothering his kindness, generosity and curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lost a phone charger and accused Julia’s mother of stealing it. He misplaced his binoculars and swore his sister took them. The neighbors asked the Pierrats to trim their gum trees and Marc flew into a rage, ranting about a supposed plot to spy on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His work performance and exercise habits appeared unaffected, which only made his outbursts more confusing — and infuriating — to Julia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the beginning of the disease nobody knew he had any issue, other than he seemed like a total jerk,” she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pierrats did not know they were at the start of a chaotic period distinct to sufferers of FTD’s behavioral variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything that can affect relationships is at the center of the presentation of the behavioral variant,” said Dr. Bruce Miller, director of the UC San Francisco Memory and Aging Center. “The first instinct of a spouse or a child or a human resource program or a psychiatrist [is to] assume a psychiatric problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with the condition start to lash out at loved ones or lose interest in lifelong relationships. They may snarl at strangers or shoplift at the mall. They consume food or alcohol obsessively, touch people inappropriately or squander the family’s savings on weird purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at first, just like in the Pierrats’ case, nobody understands why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When someone is not who they were, think neurology before psychology,” said Sharon Hall, whose husband Rod — a devoted spouse who delighted in planning romantic surprises — was diagnosed in 2015 after he started drinking heavily and sending explicit texts to other women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Julia’s insistence Marc visited his doctor in July 2021, who referred him to a neurologist. He would spend the next year making his way through a battery of appointments, scans and cognitive testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, his life disintegrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-right&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

as a superlative manager. In January 2022 he was put on notice for a host of causes: combative emails, obnoxious behavior, failures of organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At home he botched routine fix-it jobs, missed crucial appointments and got lost on familiar routes. He stopped showering and called Julia appalling names. She went to therapy and contemplated divorce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, on July 18, 2022, the couple sat across from a neurologist who delivered the diagnosis with all the delicacy of an uppercut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no cure, he told them, and few treatment options. He handed them a pamphlet. Marc showed no emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the car Julia sobbed inconsolably as Marc sat silent in the passenger seat. Eventually she caught her breath and pulled out from the parking lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;hr class="divider"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you like being married? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yes, I do. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It makes me a better person.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;That’s so sweet. How do you think it makes you a better person?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Being able to talk to you and, you know, resolve through different problems together. I mean, it’s good to have an extra mind.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They left the neurologist with nothing: no instructions, no care plan, not even the stupid pamphlet, which was about memory problems in general. “It was diagnose and adios,” Julia said. “I hit the internet immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julia now had three different roles: her paid job, Marc’s 24-hour care, and a part-time occupation finding support, services and answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

Eventually she became a volunteer AFTD ambassador, speaking and advocating for families affected by the disease.

FTD has dulled Marc’s emotional reactions, leaving Julia to carry the full weight of their grief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He grasps the impact, but somehow the emotion is buffered,” she said. “I lose it sometimes.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days the Pierrats rise around 6 a.m., eat the breakfast Julia prepares, and then Marc takes his first nap of the day (fatigue is a common FTD symptom). When he wakes around 9 a.m. Julia makes sure he uses the bathroom, and then drives him to a nearby adult daycare program where he does crafts and games until lunch. He sleeps for another few hours at home, spends two hours in the afternoon with a paid caregiver so that Julia can do errands or exercise, and then the couple eats dinner together before Marc beds down by 8 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they are awake together, they go for walks around the neighborhood or to familiar cafes or parks. The hostility of the early disease has passed. They speak tenderly to one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At each sleep, Julia walks him upstairs to the bedroom they used to share. She tucks him in and gives him a kiss. At night she retires to a downstairs guestroom, because if they share a bed Marc will pat her constantly throughout the night to make sure she’s still there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;hr class="divider"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My clock’s ticking.

Or do you feel healthy?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I feel kind of healthy, but I’m still worried. Because I have something that I can’t control inside of me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About two years ago, Julia and Marc were on one of their daily walks when she realized they had already had their last conversation as the couple they once were, with both of them in full possession of their faculties. In one crucial sense, Marc was already gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b758be8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/320x213!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0d%2Fbd%2F601f81cf4e66be89d78aea0e0f3b%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-027.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b43aa96/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/568x379!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0d%2Fbd%2F601f81cf4e66be89d78aea0e0f3b%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-027.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07831e1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/768x512!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0d%2Fbd%2F601f81cf4e66be89d78aea0e0f3b%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-027.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f401c42/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/1080x720!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0d%2Fbd%2F601f81cf4e66be89d78aea0e0f3b%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-027.jpg 1080w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/672b725/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/1240x826!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0d%2Fbd%2F601f81cf4e66be89d78aea0e0f3b%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-027.jpg 1240w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4f9b336/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/1440x960!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0d%2Fbd%2F601f81cf4e66be89d78aea0e0f3b%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-027.jpg 1440w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/54020a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x3392+0+0/resize/2160x1440!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0d%2Fbd%2F601f81cf4e66be89d78aea0e0f3b%2F1517987-me-0813-frontotemporal-dementia-gem-027.jpg 2160w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in other ways, their connection remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The love that we have is still completely there,” she said recently in the couple’s backyard, while Marc napped upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you’re married to someone and you’ve been with someone for so long, you almost have your own language between you. He and I still have that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She looked out over the potted succulents and winding stone pathways they had spent so many weekends tending together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of our relationship is preserved in spite of it, which is just so interesting, [and] also makes it more heartbreaking,” she continued. “Because you know that if the disease plays out like it is expected to, you will just continue to slowly lose pieces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average life expectancy for people with Marc’s type of FTD is five to seven years after diagnosis. Some go much sooner, and others live several years longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, all FTD variants lead to a similar end. Cognition and memory decline until language and self-care are no longer possible. The brain’s ability to regulate bodily functions, like swallowing and continence, erodes. Immobility sets in, and eventually, the heart beats for the last time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But until then, people keep living. They find reasons to keep going and ways to love one another.

And he would be proved right. In 1980, after a decades-long public health campaign that included widespread vaccination, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/smallpox" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;smallpox had been eradicated&lt;/a&gt;. It remains the only infectious disease where this has been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A sleugh of other vaccines have been developed against other diseases, from influenza to human papillomavirus infections that cause certain cancers and the Sars-COV-2 virus behind Covid-19. In the past 50 years, an estimated &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00850-X/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;154 million lives have been saved by vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, according to one recent study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Yet, opposition to vaccines – or hesitancy about accepting them – &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/1/31" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;is widespread&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jgrlxx37do" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt; in many parts of the world, even percolating into the uppermost branches of governments responsible for &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62q41qm9pvo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;improving public health&lt;/a&gt;. This week, US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr was quizzed by the Senate Finance Committee over his vaccine policies, resulting in fiery exchanges. On the same day, the surgeon general of Florida also announced plans to &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62q41qm9pvo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;end vaccine mandates in the state&lt;/a&gt;.

Why do they face protests from relatively small, but vocal, segments of the public? And how have these arguments evolved? This is a look at the long, and strange history of the anti-vax movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Back in the early 1800s, a series of controlled experiments by Jenner and other doctors quickly showed inoculation to be extremely effective, granting immunity against smallpox in well over 95% of those vaccinated.

Nadine Greeff/Stocksy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study in mice found that a ketogenic diet did not accelerate the aging of females, although it did cause males to age more rapidly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The authors of the study found that the presence of estrogen in the female mice blocked the aging effect of the diet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When males were treated with estrogen, estradiol, and antioxidants, the rapid-aging effects of the diets decreased.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further study is required to determine if these effects translate to humans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The popular &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319196" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;ketogenic, or keto, diet&lt;/a&gt; may accelerate the aging process, suggest studies in animals. According to a new murine, or mouse, study, this effect of the diet is primarily restricted to males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study suggests that estrogen protects female mice consuming a keto diet from the risk of accelerated aging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span&gt;authors of the study say the keto diet produces excess oxidative stress, which speeds up cellular aging through the production of &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/senescent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;senescent&lt;/a&gt; cells. They found that treating the male mice in their study with estrogen or estradiol and antioxidant agents eliminated this rapid cell aging&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The keto diet is a very low-carbohydrate, high fat way of eating that shifts the body’s primary energy source from carbohydrates to fat. Under normal conditions, carbohydrates are the body’s preferred fuel, especially for the brain,” explained &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, preventive cardiology dietitian at EntirelyNourished.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the body lacks the carbohydrates it normally uses for fuel, it breaks down dietary fats into molecules called “ketones.” She said these “serve as an alternative energy source for both the brain and the body.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the intake of carbohydrates and support the supply of fats, therefore, the keto diet promotes consumption of “high fat, very low-carbohydrate foods such as animal proteins, full-fat dairy, healthy fats, and non-starchy vegetables,” according to Routhenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People on the keto diet are encouraged to eat fewer carbohydrate-rich foods such as grains, fruits, starchy vegetables, legumes, and added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a long-term eating regimen, the keto diet is associated with &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319196#risks-and-complications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;several risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routhenstein noted the keto diet limits “fruits, whole grains, some vegetables, and legumes, limiting intake of essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber, which can affect negatively gut, brain, and heart health.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also concerns regarding increased cholesterol and soft arterial plaques, strained kidney and liver function, and an increased risk of bone loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the diet may lead to disordered eating and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The keto diet has also been linked to increased oxidative stress, and the resulting increase in cellular senescence was investigated in the current study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the research regarding diets has focused on males’ responses to their effects. This is at least partially due to the relative complexities of female and male bodies and how they may affect responses to diets. An example would be the dynamic changes that occur within the female body across a woman’s estrous cycle, as opposed to a man’s body, which appears to be hormonally much the same all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.dom.pitt.edu/faculty_info.aspx/Ng5639" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Jason Ng, MD, BA&lt;/a&gt;, teaches endocrinology and metabolism in the Department of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would be interesting,’ he said, “to assess the effects of diet on male and female sex hormones, such as estrogen for women and testosterone for men, and how diets may play a role in increasing or decreasing levels to a certain extent, and how that impacts the role these hormones have on their specific genders’ physiology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ng noted that the insights suggested in this study of mice, however, must be viewed as preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Although we can gain insight into metabolic processes through studies defining effects of a keto diet in mice, we do not yet extrapolate those findings in humans,” Ng said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is much more heterogeneity in the findings of effects in humans, and gender effects are likely more varied as well, compared to mice data across genders,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If these results can be replicated in human beings, there is the possibility of this specific effect reducing the age acceleration in males, although this would, of course, have to be weighed against known side effects of estrogen therapy in men,” said Ng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that it is unknown whether this therapy would need to be continued after the person had discontinued a keto diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering that the mechanism behind the increase in senescent cells appears in the study to be oxidative stress, might a purely antioxidant therapy be similarly effective for men on a keto diet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I think a purely anti-oxidant approach could also help reduce the aging effect to some degree,” hypothesized Ng.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maybe not as much of an influence as estrogen,” he suggested, “but certainly something that would be worthy of investigating more, as this approach could have a potentially lower side effect profile.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In some cases, particularly for specific medical conditions like epilepsy, a medically supervised keto or modified low carb approach can be beneficial,” Routhenstein pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A cyclical or more flexible low carb plan may also work for certain individuals when guided by a qualified healthcare provider,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keto diet may not be heart-healthy in the long term&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[T]o remain in true ketosis, carbohydrate intake must stay extremely low, something that is very difficult to maintain long term without compromising nutritional adequacy. As a cardiovascular dietitian and based on the current research, I do not recommend a ketogenic diet as a long-term heart-healthy strategy.”&lt;br&gt;— Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The potential risks outweigh the benefits, especially when more balanced, sustainable approaches are available and have been shown to improve heart health, inflammation, and longevity,” Routhenstein concluded.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MedicalNewsToday</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 07:36:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxOYVBnaE1rVFp6QWx5Tk5hMkJaRnNibFBaWjdvYlowcFl3VGcyXzFRQWlaWXNMVEtmVElVaTBFcG5yYzNXemZKYlJYbENVMGRaV19fbHJhRDNMemk1Q084SmpqRDFxQ1pzcG1VNTlkX1hmWEhRNHRTbUd3WVVOT1ByZW4ybmhuTlJnQ2JaTDVVdEt6LVhjOUo4bC10ZGhSTXBPenV1UWN3MURndmJvUlkyWFNUdF9uX1Bsa0g4SzJsRQ</guid></item><item><title>在亚马逊上购买Halle Berry的亲密和健康产品- TMZ</title><link>https://www.tmz.com/2025/09/07/halle-berry-respin-intimacy-products/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;header class="article__header"&gt;
