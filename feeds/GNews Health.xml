              &lt;p&gt;The future of medicine just might include prosthetic penises that can be printed on demand. In a study out this month, scientists have demonstrated that their 3D-printed penile implant can restore sexual function in animals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers from the U.S., Japan, and China conducted the study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last week in Nature Biomedical Engineering. In experiments with both pigs and rabbits that had damaged penile tissue, their 3D-printed gel-based implant allowed the injured animals to successfully mate and reproduce as usual. The technology could lead to better functional replacements for penises as well as other organs that are rich in blood vessels, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_2000574060" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000574060" class="wp-caption alignleft"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2000574060" src="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-1024x369-1.jpg" alt="Biomimeticpenis 1024x369" srcset="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-1024x369-1.jpg 1024w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-1024x369-1-300x108.jpg 300w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-1024x369-1-768x277.jpg 768w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-1024x369-1-680x245.jpg 680w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-1024x369-1-896x323.jpg 896w" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 1279px) calc(100vw - 26rem), 680px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000574060" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The team’s biomimetic model of a penis’s head and corpus cavernosum. © Wang et al/Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The penis is a complex organ, thanks to the intricate network of blood vessels and tissues needed to engorge it. Scientists have historically struggled to create models in the lab that can accurately replicate the structures of vessel-rich organs like the penis, but the researchers said they’ve made a major step forward with their latest work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, they created a model of the glans, the “head” of the penis, and the corpus spongiosum, the spongy column of tissue along the penile shaft that surrounds the urethra and contains the blood vessels responsible for making the penis erect (blood flows into the arteries of the penis, which also presses up against the veins there, keeping the blood in place and the penis rigid). The team’s model even mimicked the urethral structures found in a typical penis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Secondly, they 3D-printed a gel-based scaffold modeled after the corpus spongiosum, one designed to withstand the enlargement of a penis during sex. These implants were then transplanted into rabbits and pigs that had a partly damaged corpus spongiosum. The researchers also seeded some of their implants with endothelial cells (cells that line the blood vessels) from the animals, hoping that the fusion would improve their odds of being functional.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_2000574055" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000574055" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2000574055" src="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/PigPenisImplant.jpg" alt="Pigpenisimplant" srcset="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/PigPenisImplant.jpg 968w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/PigPenisImplant-279x300.jpg 279w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/PigPenisImplant-953x1024.jpg 953w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/PigPenisImplant-768x825.jpg 768w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/PigPenisImplant-633x680.jpg 633w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/PigPenisImplant-834x896.jpg 834w" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 1279px) calc(100vw - 26rem), 680px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000574055" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;From top to bottom: Images showing a normal pig penis; a penis with a damaged corpus cavernosum; and a pig penis repaired with the team’s implant fused with endothelial cells two weeks after the transplant. © Wang et al/Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The implants seemed to significantly improve the animals’ erectile function within weeks, especially when they were seeded with endothelial cells. Overall, the animals with fused implants had improved tissue regeneration and their erectile function essentially returned to normal, even allowing them to reproduce with 100% effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The fertility of the [endothelial cell] groups demonstrates the recovery of erectile function and the ability to ejaculate, suggesting the restoration of the cavernous tissue in the treated males,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results only show off a proof-of-concept for now. The scientists note that more research will be needed to develop implants capable of regenerating and restoring more severely damaged penises in humans. But they say that their model should make it easier to study erectile dysfunction, and they believe that their work can foster the creation of truly impressive replacements for the penis and similar organs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings support the further development of 3D-printed blood-vessel-rich functional organs for transplantation,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This 7-day meal plan is set at 1,800 calories per day, with modifications for 1,500 and 2,000 calories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ample protein and fiber support sustained energy levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This plan prioritizes nutritious whole foods while avoiding added sugar and limiting ultra-processed foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Looking for an energy boost? Most of us would appreciate a little more pep in our step and, thankfully, the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290484/why-the-mediterranean-diet-is-so-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; may be able to help. Research links following this nutritious eating style with a reduced incidence of fatigue in older adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In this seven-day high-fiber, high-protein routine, you’ll find a wide variety of proteins, whole grains, fresh produce and healthy fats. What you won’t find is any &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7899305/top-sources-of-added-sugar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt;. We limit ultra-processed foods and refined grains and completely skip added sugars in this plan. To keep you full and energized between meals, we prioritize foods rich in fiber and protein. These two nutrients are digested more slowly than refined grains and simple sugars and can help promote satiety. Each day in this plan provides an average of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;99 grams of protein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;35 grams of fiber&lt;/a&gt;. We set this plan at 1,800 calories per day and included modifications for 1,500 and 2,000 calories per day to support those with other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8033186/what-are-calories/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;calorie needs&lt;/a&gt;. While we previously included meal plans and modifications for 1,200 calories, we no longer do. &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting your calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! If there’s a meal you don’t like, feel free to repeat a meal in this plan or browse some of our other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18314/cuisines-regions/mediterranean/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/no-added-sugar-recipes-8660360" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;no-sugar-added recipes&lt;/a&gt; for additional inspiration. We aimed for at least 28 grams of fiber and 90 grams of protein per day. If you’re closely monitoring calories, you may want to choose a meal with a similar nutrition profile or adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can eat the same breakfast or lunch every day if that’s easier for your routine. The breakfasts are between 344 and 370 calories, while the lunches span 354 to 478 calories. These ranges are fairly similar, so a simple swap should work for most people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What is the Mediterranean diet?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet is a flexible way of eating that emphasizes an array of protein sources, including seafood, legumes, poultry, nuts, dairy, eggs and meat. It includes whole grains, an abundance of fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds and healthy fats. It limits ultra-processed foods, refined grains and added sugars.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_181-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057767/10-surprising-foods-with-more-sugar-than-a-glazed-donut/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Added sugars&lt;/a&gt; are, as the name implies, sugars that are added during processing to add sweetness. Added sugars include high-fructose corn syrup, sugar, agave, honey, maple syrup and more. You’ll find added sugars in the usual suspects, like sweetened drinks and desserts, but you may be surprised to learn what other foods contain added sugars. You’ll often find them in foods like breads, crackers, granola bars, bottled salad dressings and sauces. While &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292028/how-many-grams-of-sugar-should-you-eat-per-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt; are fine in moderation for most people, many of us are eating more added sugars than we realize. The average American adult consumes 17 teaspoons of added sugar per day—considerably above the American Heart Association’s recommended daily max of 6 teaspoons for women and 9 for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A high intake of added sugar is linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, obesity and heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Nick Norwitz, a researcher-educator specializing in metabolism, claims that the high fructose content in fruits can be harmful &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers discovered mice who were fed high-fructose corn syrup for four weeks had the villi (fingerlike projections that absorb nutrients from food) inside their small intestines to be about 40 percent longer than their counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those fed high-fructose corn syrup also gained significantly more weight and fat mass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists concluded fructose improved the survival of cells in the villi which caused it to lengthen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With a high number of cells and longer villi, the body would absorb more nutrients. This could lead to increased fat absorption and weight gain when combined with a high-fat diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists also examined the effects of fructose on colorectal cancer cells and discovered that it could increase tumor growth by helping the toxic cells live longer in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some studies suggest that fructose can cause damage, a 2014 literature review by National Institute of Medicine found that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11722715/Are-fruit-phobe-Doctors-debunk-common-myth-fruit-bad-you.html"&gt;fructose does not have specific effects &lt;/a&gt;on the body that can cause weight gain compared with eating sugar from other sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, experts at the the American Heart Association, point out that mango has more than 20 vitamins and minerals, including high doses of vitamins A and C, high fiber content and tons of antioxidants that are 'beneficial for colon cancer prevention, heart disease and weight control.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fruits in general are also widely beneficial for regular bowel movements and digestion due to their high fiber content and is packed with vitamins that help improve eye health, boost immune system through antioxidants and regulate blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Norwitz named mango as the highest fructose containing fruit - with about 30 grams of fructose in a full-sized mango&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Harvard and Oxford University graduate explained the negative effects of high fructose consumption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fructose is a sugar found naturally in fruits, some vegetables and honey. It is also commonly added to processed foods in the form of high fructose corn syrup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Manufacturers use high fructose corn syrup to make sugar-sweetened beverages and ultra-processed foods sodas, breakfast cereals, dairy products such as yogurts and candies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After mangoes, Dr Norwitz then noted that jackfruit has around 15.2 grams of fructose in a cup as compared to a cup blueberries which only has 7.6 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fruit has become incredibly popular in recent years as a plant-based meat alternative due to its texture being remarkably similar to pulled meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, those suffering from diabetes or are at risk of having low blood sugar levels may be advised to steer clear of jackfruit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2021 peer study published in the Scientific World Journal discovered that jackfruit extract may increase insulin levels and significantly lower blood glucose levels - creating danger for those with fluctuating sugar levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that mice who had been fed extract from jackfruit leaves had elevated insulin and reduced blood glucose levels compared to others who had eaten a control diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists concluded that that jackfruit leaf extract contains flavonoids that may help prevent cell death in the pancreas, which is the organ that produces insulin, therefore increase the production of insulin the body and reduce blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sudden decrease in blood sugar can cause difficulty concentrating, dizziness, chest pain and seizures. In the long run, it can also cause brain damage and sometimes, death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite this, jackfruit is known to be good source of vitamin C, which is a powerful antioxidant that is essential for a healthy immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are also known to produce substances called phytochemicals (plant-based chemical compounds), such as flavonoids, saponins and tannins that have cancer-fighting benefits, such as preventing cancer cells from forming in your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even though it has gained reputation as a replacement for pork or chicken in many main dishes, jackfruit cannot compete with these animal products in terms of protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One cup of raw jackfruit has less than three grams of protein while a cup of typical everyday meats such as chicken have 38 grams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Norwitz then noted that jackfruit is extremely harmful to the body &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Regardless of color, grapes have 12.3 grams of fructose per cup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, the metabolism expert warned of the dangers of grapes due to their high sugar content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regardless of color, grapes have 12.3 grams of fructose per cup as compared to a banana with just 5.7 grams of fructose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating too many grapes at once can cause the body to not absorb fructose efficiently and lead to bloating, gas and stomach upset, especially if eaten on an empty stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the tannins in grapes can also irritate the stomach lining, potentially causing discomfort and diarrhea in some people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But previous research has shown that grape consumption supports heart health and  improvements in memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some lower-fructose fruits include berries, kiwi, citrus fruits and non-sweet, low-carb fruits like coconut, avocado and olives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The United States Department of Agriculture recommends that adults eat 1.5 to 2 cups of fruit per day &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 18:25:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQUEJoNjgyLVp2cDdJTXU3TEIzdjZuRlNIcm1nYWJDY0lwUGpKNHRyU1hEbl9yRUg4Mk16V2tPbFgtUGVkZVAzLUZwb2RMd3ctWTdYYmpOTzAwUEZ2S2tYM3JxbmdFTDR6WmE4eWlRQ1h2YXgydFBHNmliODlfRnNVLVNaSk5mVUVGa0staTA3eXVDdFdNRVVwcUlOMjRCeWEwQVFB0gGoAUFVX3lxTE1ZY29wNTdta3V2TThRRkRPVF9xLXJWNkVKU01jakZlN1dnaFYweWxPWlVMdVZCdkFBNmtmSGFxbTE1dUNlRllMdzltR0RIMHRnb1pxaFlHWTFKUG05Nk10dldsa0xVY3BhQ25VMEhNQmZXVnRUcjNNMnhQd1F0dmhsaDJrTXc5UDAxUFIxZ0hLQkVsYkxXUEVBUDdoVkVrODBmMUtuaHpZSw</guid></item><item><title>Why Older People May Not Need to Watch Blood Sugar So Closely - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE5wdTM0QmxENThPc1FVRFVldUJhcW85MjZPa1V0YlpmY1ZMZDFKZFhYQWZwd0VYSHRVR19wV0U1UXRlU1J5M0VVeXpRcmNlMzN0V0JONUZ4WGlxLW5QcHVJMUN6NEYweW5JYXV5RU10YW5jaG5UNV9JMDk5bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;By now, Ora Larson recognizes what’s happening. “It feels like you’re shaking inside,” she said. “I’m speeded up.

While previous research has identified microplastics in organs such as the liver, kidneys, and placenta, this study suggests that the brain may be especially vulnerable to these tiny synthetic particles. The findings raise pressing questions about the potential effects of plastic buildup on brain health, particularly in relation to neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of microplastics and nanoplastics in our environment has grown exponentially over the last 50 years. These tiny plastic particles, ranging in size from microscopic to the width of a pencil eraser, are now found everywhere – in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the soil where our food grows. While it is known that these particles are making their way into the human body, lodging in organs like the liver, kidneys, and even the placenta, the extent of their accumulation and their potential for harm are not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although some studies in cells and animals have shown negative effects, those studies often used amounts of microplastics much higher than what humans are typically exposed to. A real understanding of the issue requires knowing how much plastic is actually accumulating in different human tissues. Until recently, we lacked reliable methods for measuring these tiny particles, particularly the smallest ones (nanoplastics), in human tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences, led by toxicologist Matthew Campen, developed a new way to detect and measure microplastics in human tissue. They previously used this method to examine placentas and testes. In this new study, they applied the technique to human brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain tissue samples came from the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, which keeps tissue from autopsies for several years. The researchers compared older tissue samples (from around 2016) with more recent samples (from 2024). All the brain tissue analyzed was from the frontal cortex, the area of the brain located behind the forehead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the microplastics, the researchers first chemically dissolved the tissue. This created a liquid mixture. They then spun this mixture at very high speeds in a machine called a centrifuge. This process separated out any undissolved materials, including plastics, into a small pellet. Next, they heated this pellet to a very high temperature (600 degrees Celsius), a process that breaks down the plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the plastics burned, they released gases. The researchers then used a sophisticated instrument called a mass spectrometer to identify the specific types of plastic based on the gases released. This allowed them to determine both the quantity and type of plastic present in the original brain tissue. The team could identify 12 different polymers. In addition to this chemical analysis, the researchers also used powerful microscopes, including a transmission electron microscope, to directly visualize the plastic particles in the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found surprisingly high levels of microplastics in the brain tissue. The concentration of plastics in the brain was much greater than that found in the liver or kidney samples. It was also higher than levels previously reported in placentas and testes. The median amount of total plastics for 2024 brain samples was 4917 micrograms per gram, and for 2016 samples, it was 3345 micrograms per gram. For comparison, the 2024 liver and kidney samples were 433 and 404 micrograms per gram, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more concerning was the finding that the amount of plastic in the brain was increasing over time. Brain tissue samples from 2024 had significantly higher levels of microplastics than samples from 2016, representing an approximate 50% increase in just eight years. The predominant type of plastic found in the brain was polyethylene, a common plastic used in packaging, bottles, and cups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using electron microscopy, the researchers were able to see very small, sharp-edged plastic particles, some as small as 200 nanometers in size (which is only slightly larger than some viruses). These tiny particles are small enough to potentially cross the protective barrier that normally separates the bloodstream from the brain, although the exact mechanism by which these plastics are entering the brain is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To look at trends over a longer time period, the researchers also analyzed brain tissue samples from the eastern United States, dating back as far as 1997. These older samples showed lower levels of microplastics, supporting the idea that plastic accumulation in the brain is increasing over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another striking finding was that brain tissue from individuals who had been diagnosed with dementia contained significantly higher levels of microplastics – up to 10 times more – than brain tissue from people without dementia. While the study does not establish a direct causal link between plastic accumulation and neurodegenerative diseases, it raises important questions. The researchers speculate that microplastics could contribute to neurological conditions by obstructing blood flow, interfering with neural connections, or triggering inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We start thinking that maybe these plastics obstruct blood flow in capillaries,” Campen said. “There’s the potential that these nanomaterials interfere with the connections between axons in the brain. They could also be a seed for aggregation of proteins involved in dementia. We just don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He believes that food, especially meat, is the primary source of microplastics entering the body, as commercial meat production tends to accumulate plastic particles within the food chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,” Campen said. “We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Avoid Microplastics and Future Research Directions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate commentary on the study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020.xml?body=FullText" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Brain Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, emphasized the significance of these findings and the urgent need for further investigation. The commentary noted that while the presence of microplastics in the human brain is concerning, scientists still do not fully understand their impact on brain function. It is unclear whether microplastics actively contribute to neurodegenerative diseases or whether people with dementia accumulate more plastic simply because their brains are less able to clear it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The dramatic increase in brain microplastic concentrations over just eight years, from 2016 to 2024, is particularly alarming,” said Nicholas Fabiano from the University of Ottawa’s Department of Psychiatry, the lead author of the commentary. “This rise mirrors the exponential increase we’re seeing in environmental microplastic levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important for the public to be aware of the increasing amounts of microplastics in the environment and uptake into our bodies. We should also understand the methods available to help reduce microplastic intake while research continues seeking methods to their removal from our bodies, which continues to be scarce in evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies have suggested that microplastics could affect brain health. Experiments on fish have shown that exposure to nanoplastics impairs swimming ability and hunting behavior. In mice, prolonged exposure to microplastics led to memory deficits, inflammation, and reduced levels of key proteins involved in brain function. While these studies indicate potential risks, more research is needed to determine whether similar effects occur in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commentary also highlighted the increasing presence of microplastics in food and water. People who drink bottled water, for example, ingest significantly more microplastics than those who consume tap water. Heating food in plastic containers has been shown to release billions of plastic particles into food, raising concerns about dietary exposure. Other sources of microplastic ingestion include seafood, processed foods, and even tea bags, which can release millions of tiny plastic particles when steeped in hot water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bottled water alone can expose people to nearly as many microplastic particles annually as all ingested and inhaled sources combined,” said Brandon Luu, an Internal Medicine Resident at the University of Toronto. “Switching to tap water could reduce this exposure by almost 90%, making it one of the simplest ways to cut down on microplastic intake.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heating food in plastic containers—especially in the microwave—can release substantial amounts of microplastics and nanoplastics,” he explains. “Avoiding plastic food storage and using glass or stainless steel alternatives is a small but meaningful step in limiting exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts to reduce microplastic exposure may help limit their accumulation in the body, but it is unclear whether this would lead to a reduction in brain plastic levels over time. The commentary suggested that more studies should focus on potential methods of eliminating microplastics from the body. Some research has indicated that plastic-related chemicals like bisphenol A can be excreted through sweat, raising the possibility that exercise or sauna use could aid in microplastic removal. However, no direct evidence currently exists to confirm whether the human body can effectively clear accumulated microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commentary concludes by emphasizing the need for more research to establish safe exposure limits for microplastics and to understand the long-term health consequences of exposure. Large-scale studies in humans are needed to determine the relationship between microplastic exposure and the development of chronic diseases. Improved methods for measuring microplastics in living humans are also essential for tracking accumulation and assessing the effectiveness of strategies to reduce exposure. It is also important to research ways to remove plastics from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need more research to wrap our heads around microplastics—rather than wrapping our brains in them—since this could be one of the biggest environmental storms most people never saw coming,” remarked David Puder, host of the Psychiatry &amp;amp; Psychotherapy Podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Bioaccumulation of microplastics in decedent human brains&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Alexander J.

We keep doing more and more CTs, and the doses keep going up.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Smith Bindman said between two machines, one could be exposing patients to 10 to 15 times higher radiation doses than the other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'There is very large variation and the doses vary by an order of magnitude — tenfold, not 10 percent different — for patients seen for the same clinical problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 93million scans are performed in the US every year, according to IMV, a medical market research company - and that number is rising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation exposure is measured in millisieverts (mSv), which measures the amount of radiation absorbed by the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People are exposed to small amounts of radiation every day from their background environment or through things like flying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2007 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra072149"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;published in the The New England Journal of Medicine said a&lt;span&gt;lthough the risks to one person from CT scans are not large, 'the increasing exposure to radiation in the population may be a public health issue in the future.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study authors wrote cancers attributable to CT radiation may fall in the range of 1.5 percent to two percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2009 study Dr Smith-Bindman was involved in looked at the radiation dose associated with the 11 most common types of CT scans performed on 1,119 adult patients in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation exposure varied widely. Average doses ranged from 2 mSv for a head CT to 31 mSv for an abdominal and pelvic CT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For comparison, A roundtrip flight between New York and Tokyo exposes a person to 0.19 mSv. An x-ray of the stomach emits 0.6 mSv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers found the amount of radiation emitted by CT scanners varied widely across the four hospitals they collected data from - with a 13-fold difference between the highest and lowest doses for each scan type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team then estimated cancers resulting from CT scans based on age and sex of the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 270 women and one in 600 men who underwent a CT scan of arteries near their heart at 40 years old will develop cancer from that scan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the estimated percent lifetime risk of death from cancer that is attributable to the radiation from a single CT scan of the abdomen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 8,100 women and one in 11,000 men who had a routine head CT scan at 40 will develop cancer from that scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For patients in their 20s, the risks were about double, and for patients in their 60s, the risks were halved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers did not mention what type of cancer the patients may develop.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancers that have previously been linked to radiation include leukemia, breast, colon, bladder, stomach, ovarian, lung and liver cancers, according to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team concluded: 'Radiation doses from commonly performed diagnostic CT examinations are higher and more variable than generally quoted, highlighting the need for greater standardization across institutions.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CT scans are life-saving medical scans, but they are not without risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an attempt to tackle the problem, new Medicare regulations effective this year will require hospitals and imaging centers to collect and share information about the radiation emitted by their scanners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The regulations also require a more careful inspection of the dosing, quality and necessity of CT scans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new rules, issued in the final weeks of the Biden administration, are being rolled out over three years in hospitals and outpatient clinics and providers could face fines if they do not comply, beginning in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Trump administration has not commented on its plans to follow, revise or reverse the new policies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike standard balance training, which typically focuses on stretches and strengthening practices, vestibular-based exercises are designed to enhance the vestibular system — the sensory system that provides information about body position and a sense of balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the small study, which involved 40 middle-stage Parkinson’s patients in Egypt, the individuals receiving such training showed “significant sustained improvements” in an assessment of gait, or manner of walking, over time, the researchers noted. Balance also was significantly improved in the study group “in all test conditions,” according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The findings provide valuable information for healthcare professionals and clinicians involved in the rehabilitation and treatment of patients with [Parkinson’s disease], forming the development of evidence-based interventions and rehabilitation programs,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/nri/6846267"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Effect of Vestibular-Oriented Balance Training on Postural Control and Risk of Fall in Patients With Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neurology Research International&lt;/em&gt; by a team of scientists from Egypt and the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Benefits of standard balance training seen only with mild disease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Parkinson’s, the loss of nerve cells that produce dopamine, a signaling molecule that helps control movement, leads to &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as tremors, rigidity, and stiffness. These symptoms can also contribute to balance issues, increasing the risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neurodegeneration that underlies Parkinson’s can also affect the vestibular system, the sensory system that provides information about body position. When this system is damaged, a person’s balance, ability to control eye movements when the head is moving, and sense of spatial orientation are all affected. This adds to the risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conventional balance training for Parkinson’s patients typically consists of traditional flexibility, strength, and balance training, including stretches, strengthening exercises using resistance bands in all directions, and rocking from the heels to the toes with and without support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the impact of standard balance training on the risk of falls in Parkinson’s remains inconclusive. Multiple studies show no effect, while others show some benefits — but solely among those with mild disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vestibular-focused training is an alternative approach to balance training that’s designed to improve the workings of this system. It may include interventions to promote hip strategies for balance, step training for fall prevention, and techniques to improve the use of vestibular inputs, such as following a moving target with the eyes while standing still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, according to the team, “more research is needed to identify and establish the essential elements of balance training that can provide more informed guidelines for practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more, the researchers — from Cairo University in Giza and the University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences in Austin, Texas — conducted a study that evaluated the benefits of vestibular-oriented balance training during the middle stage of Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adults in the study, who ranged in age from 67 to 84, were all in the middle stages of Parkinson’s and were on stable therapy. Each was randomly assigned to vestibular-oriented balance training or standard balance training — the latter formed the control group — for eight weeks, or nearly two months. Assessments were conducted at the study’s start, or baseline, before the interventions began, and then at the end of the eight weeks and again at 12 weeks, or a month after the program ended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Falls among study group dropped 30% by week 8, were sustained&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To promote hip balance, the vestibular-oriented interventions had patients use an elastic band to resist hip movements while standing on a foam pad, and also take side and forward steps with an ankle weight. For fall prevention, interventions involved forward and side lunges, and tapping the forefoot on an eight-inch step placed on the front and to both sides. Vestibular input exercises included standing still with both eyes tracking a moving target, followed by head turns to the right and left and up and down, and then with eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the eight-week testing period, more patients in the experimental group reported fewer falls than those in the control group. In this period, about 45% of the patients in the experimental group reported at least one fall, compared with 65% of those in the control group. However, these differences were not considered to be statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By week eight, at the end of the training period, the number of falls dropped by 30% in patients in the experimental group — a significant reduction compared with the 5% drop seen in those in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Functional Gait Assessment, or FGA, was used to gauge postural stability and the ability to perform multiple motor tasks during walking. While FGA scores were similar at baseline, they were significantly higher (better) at both eight and 12 weeks with vestibular-focused training compared with standard training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From baseline, patients in the experimental group showed significant sustained improvements in FGA scores over time, while those in the control group had significantly improved at week eight, but didn’t show further improvements at week 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;The study suggests that vestibular-oriented balance training could be an effective intervention to improve postural control and decrease the risk of falls in individuals with mild to moderate [Parkinson’s disease]. … [Also, the findings] would suggest that physical therapists may consider intervening earlier in the disease process with balance interventions intended to reduce falls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (mCTSIB) assessed an individual’s ability to maintain balance under various sensory conditions. Among them were having one’s eyes open or closed while standing on a stable (rigid) or compliant (soft) surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like FGA scores, the mCTSIB scores significantly improved for patients in the experimental group under all sensory conditions compared with the control group at eight and 12 weeks. Over time, the study group improved significantly in all test conditions, while the control group showed significant improvements solely on stable surfaces with eyes open or closed, without lasting effects at week 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings, the researchers wrote, “would suggest that physical therapists may consider intervening earlier in the disease process with balance interventions intended to reduce falls” among people with Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vestibular-focused balance training holds promise for preventing falls, particularly under conditions of compromised visual and [sensory] inputs,” the team wrote. “The study suggests that vestibular-oriented balance training could be an effective intervention to improve postural control and decrease the risk of falls in individuals with mild to moderate [Parkinson’s disease].”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jamie Samnang, 41, initially thought she'd suffered a mosquito bite when she developed an intensely itchy rash on her arm which caused her to scratch so hard, she drew blood&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I started to feel a slight tingling, a slight itch,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I thought maybe I'd been bitten by a mosquito, but as the days went on it kept getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Bite cream wasn't working and I started to get these red raised bumps that were filled with pus.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said the itching was so 'intense and severe' she ended up scratching until she bled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ringworm patients are urged not to scratch the affected areas as this enables the fungus to spread to other body parts, as occurred in Mrs Samnang's case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It spread to my legs and ankles because I was itching my arms and then touching my legs,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being diagnosed with ringworm by a dermatologist, Mrs Samnang said she was 'shocked and disgusted' adding she had no idea that gyms were a hotspot for the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

Some patients have runny or stuffy noses and sore throats, and some people experience diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;More severe illness includes difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, seizures and what the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/about/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;calls&lt;/a&gt; “altered consciousness” – all signs that a patient should go to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Very red or irritated eyes (known as conjunctivitis or “pink eye”) have also been a common symptom in this outbreak, and are not a typical flu symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-many-people-have-died-from-bird-flu" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How many people have died from bird flu?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Since 2003, there have been more than 950 reported cases of H5N1 globally, and &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai_20250131.pdf?sfvrsn=5f006f99_149#:~:text=Globally%2C%20from%201%20January%202003,fatal%20(CFR%20of%2049%25)." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;49%&lt;/a&gt; of patients have died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the US outbreak, the mortality rate has been much lower so far. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;70&lt;/a&gt; confirmed cases, and several more probable cases, in the past year. One person has died, and three others have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It’s possible the mortality rate is lower because the cases detected in this outbreak have been less severe. But the mortality rate is still significantly high in cases that are bad enough to need hospital care, said Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In countries with poor access to healthcare, the mortality rate may be higher because sick patients aren’t able to get care that could save their lives, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The virus can be really nasty for some people,” said Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and dean of the Yale School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;We don’t know yet what puts someone at risk of getting really sick, Ranney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Flu viruses mutate and evolve quickly. If bird flu begins spreading between humans, there could be changes in how it sickens people, she added. “There’s really no way for me to say, if it becomes a pandemic, that we’re going to have the same case fatality ratio that we’re seeing right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-bird-flu-spread-to-humans" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How does bird flu spread to humans?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Bird flu spreads through contact with animals and unpasteurized animal products. That means the people who are most at risk are those who care for chickens and dairy cattle, those who come into contact with wild birds and animals, and anyone drinking raw milk or eating undercooked meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There have also been two US cases, in California and Missouri, where patients got sick with H5N1 with no known contact with animals or raw food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There has been no documented transmission between humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, details about the outbreak have been scarce in the past month especially, starting with a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/15/musk-doge-bird-flu-pandemic" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;communications blackout at health agencies&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s not clear if new patterns of transmission have emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We’re missing opportunities to learn more about this virus and the risk that it poses to people and our economy,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. “But also, we’re missing the opportunity to possibly discover something that would make us worry less about the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-treatment-for-bird-flu" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is the treatment for bird flu?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Flu antivirals like Tamiflu seem to work against bird flu by reducing the severity of illness and possibly keeping patients from transmitting it to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But Tamiflu needs to be given soon after illness starts.

But we don’t use them yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Some of the shots for people have been licensed for use in the US, while others are still awaiting approval. The US government has stockpiled 4.8m doses of H5N1 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/02/bird-flu-vaccine" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;none of them&lt;/a&gt; are available to the public. The reasons why are complicated: there have been few hospitalizations and deaths in the US, there isn’t evidence of person-to-person transmission, and officials worry about hesitation over a new vaccine, Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/02/bird-flu-vaccine" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Experts say the vaccine should be made available to farm workers, veterinarians and other people at risk. “This is a recurring occupational hazard,” Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There are also vaccines for poultry, and scientists are working on a cow vaccine as well. But none of these have been given to animals yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="does-the-seasonal-flu-shot-help" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Does the seasonal flu shot help?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“You should get the seasonal flu vaccine to protect you from seasonal flu,” Davis said. Another reason is that in rare cases when someone catches H5N1, they might catch the seasonal flu at the same time – and the two variants could mix together in a process called reassortment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;This could cause H5N1 to become more easily transmissible or cause more severe disease, suggested Davis. “Brand-new viruses that can transmit easily are the ones that tend to cause epidemics or pandemics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Fewer cases of seasonal flu takes pressure off the healthcare system during flu season, and makes it easier for doctors and health departments to identify rare infections like H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-bird-flu-going-to-get-worse" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Is bird flu going to get worse?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Any hopes that the current outbreak would simply pass through “have been dashed”, Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We have to be looking ahead to what would happen if this virus began spreading more easily between people,” Nuzzo has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/15/biden-administration-bird-flu-funding" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “If it could spread easily between people, we would be in a pandemic, and it would be around the globe in a matter of weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Experts expect another flu pandemic at some point. It might not be H5N1 – it might be a combination of H5N1 and a different flu variant, or a different type altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;That means it’s important to prepare vaccines, treatments and tests, and to strengthen healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-i-get-a-test-for-bird-flu" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Can I get a test for bird flu?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Yes. Your doctor can order an H5N1 test for you at commercial laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It’s important to let your doctor know why you think you might have bird flu – for instance, if you work closely with animals or consume raw milk, meat or eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It will help the health authorities to get things in the queue much faster for further testing,” Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-there-a-risk-of-bird-flu-from-raw-milk-eggs-or-meat" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Is there a risk of bird flu from raw milk, eggs or meat?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Raw milk can contain enormous quantities of virus. While no cases have been reported yet in humans from drinking raw milk, it has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/cats-bird-flu" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;sickened&lt;/a&gt; and killed mammals such as cats – so officials strongly recommend against it for people, as well. Pasteurization (boiling milk for a certain amount of time) kills the virus and makes milk safe to drink. Eggs and meat should be cooked fully to kill all pathogens, including bird flu, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/egg-guidance-regulation-and-other-information/questions-and-answers-regarding-safety-eggs-during-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-outbreaks" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Davis recommended “good hygiene practices writ large in the kitchen,” such as washing your hands after handling raw eggs or meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It’s illegal for sick animals to enter the food chain, but US officials have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/18/usda-dairy-cows-bird-flu-survey" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;detected&lt;/a&gt; bird flu in meat from dairy cows intended for slaughter.

&lt;p&gt;On the parish level, the largest declines in total vaccination rates from the 2021-2022 school year to the 2023-2024 school year occurred in Concordia, Jefferson Davis, Cameron, Beauregard and East Feliciana parishes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Concordia Parish: from 79.5% in 2021-2022, to 90.84% in 2022-2023 and to &lt;strong&gt;52.97%&lt;/strong&gt; in 2023-2024.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jefferson Davis Parish: 89.79% in 2021-2022, to 89.71% in 2022-2023 and to &lt;strong&gt;58.67%&lt;/strong&gt; in 2023-2024. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cameron Parish: from 82.86% in 2021-2022, to 93.15% in 2022-2023 and to &lt;strong&gt;65.38%&lt;/strong&gt; in 2023-2024.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beauregard Parish: from 92.35% in 2021-2022, to 87.47% in 2022-2023 and to &lt;strong&gt;71.4%&lt;/strong&gt; in 2023-2024.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;East Feliciana Parish: from 92.22% in 2021-2022, to 81.48% in 2022-2023 and  to &lt;strong&gt;71.51%&lt;/strong&gt; in 2023-2024. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2023-2024 school year, Madison, Red River, Pointe Coupee, Iberville, Assumption and Bienville parishes had the highest vaccination rates among its kindergarteners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to go to school, &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center-PHCH/Center-PH/immunizations/2023-2024-Immunization_Guide_for_Louisiana_Schools.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Louisiana requires&lt;/a&gt; four doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine (DTaP); three doses of the polio vaccine, two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR); three doses of the hepatitis B vaccine (HepB); two doses of the hepatitis A vaccine (HepA); and two doses of the varicella vaccine (chickenpox or Var). &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p1123-measles-threat.html" target="_blank"&gt;a 95% measles vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt; for schools in order to reach "herd immunity" — when enough of the population is immune to the disease to prevent its spread.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The CDC says the rate of vaccinations needed for herd immunity depends on the disease:&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The vaccination rate of whooping cough (pertussis) should be &lt;strong&gt;above 90%&lt;/strong&gt; to trigger herd immunity, according to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7999208/#:~:text=Herd%20immunity%20against%20pertussis%20agents,in%20all%20countries%20and%20regions" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The vaccination rate of polio should be &lt;strong&gt;at least 80%&lt;/strong&gt; to trigger herd immunity, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The vaccination rate for hepatitis A and hepatitis B should be &lt;strong&gt;at least 80%&lt;/strong&gt; to trigger herd immunity, according to the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/78/4/976/7280117" target="_blank"&gt;Oxford Academic Journal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Well, according to the experts at &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.webmd.com/sex/stop-having-sex-health"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt;, quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;There are a number of health benefits associated with having sex (Studio4 / Getty Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Anxiety and stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Up first on the rundown is your &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/mental-health"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;During sex, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/science"&gt;chemicals&lt;/a&gt; like oxytocin, dopamine and endorphins - AKA 'feel good hormones - are released and these can help you manage the effects of stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Additionally, the former, which is also referred to as the 'love hormone' has an added benefit of helping you get to &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/sleep"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Relationship health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Not only do all three chemicals help reduce stress, but they aid in boosting your mood and deepening emotional intimacy with your partner - both of which contribute to better mental health overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;For example, if you found you and your partner were previously having a noticeable amount more sex than you are now, then it could make you feel less connected to one another which could raise stress and anxiety around the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Obviously, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/life"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; can also just get in the way sometimes with busy schedules, family issues and work drama too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Sex can help boost emotional intimacy with your partner (filadendron / Getty Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Sex can apparently seriously boost your immune system by increasing the production of antibodies that protect against &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/life/bacterial-vaginosis-bv-symptoms-sti-explained-326092-20250307"&gt;infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This means you could experience less common colds and other similar illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According to the experts, one of the best things you can do for your immune system is to get enough quality sleep each night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;And, because sex is linked to better sleep, having it regularly can help strengthen your overall immune health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Menstrual health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If you find you get seriously bad cramps during your &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/health"&gt;period&lt;/a&gt;, then sex may help alleviate some of the discomfort - however, this isn't the case for every person who bleeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The science behind it follows the reason behind why we even get cramps in the first place: because our uterus contracts to shed its lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Orgasms can also cause contractions in the uterine muscle which are usually followed by a big release that can ease tension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While period sex may not be for everyone, it's sounds like a pretty great &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/life-hacks"&gt;life hack&lt;/a&gt; if you ask me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Some people find that sex helps alleviate their period cramps!

His team injected mice with glucose containing a "heavy" isotope, meaning a version of carbon that carries an extra neutron. This allowed them to trace the heavy carbons as the bacteria transformed glucose into other compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stool samples revealed that bacteria in mice treated with metformin had converted the heavy glucose into short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). "Bacterial species that produce short chain fatty acids are generally 'good' bacteria," suggesting metformin’s effects could potentially foster a healthy microbiome, Ogawa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metformin treatment caused SCFAs containing heavy carbon to increase by just 1% in stool samples. However, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.irsjd.org/en/people/staff/146/manuel-vazquez-carrera" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.irsjd.org/en/people/staff/146/manuel-vazquez-carrera" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Manuel Vázquez-Carrera&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a pharmacology researcher at the University of Barcelona who was not involved with the study, told Live Science in an email that "most SCFAs are rapidly absorbed and utilized rather than excreted." That means the measurement was likely an underestimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And "even a slight rise in SCFA production could enhance gut barrier function, reduce inflammation, and improve insulin sensitivity, all of which are beneficial for managing diabetes," Fernández-Real speculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study had a few limitations. First, the researchers did not assess how higher levels of gut SCFAs affected the health of the mice. It also included "a very small number of participants who were receiving varying doses of metformin as part of their treatment regimes," Morrice said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mouse work also involved only male rodents, so &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/lets-just-study-males-and-keep-it-simple-how-excluding-female-animals-from-research-held-neuroscience-back-and-could-do-so-again" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/lets-just-study-males-and-keep-it-simple-how-excluding-female-animals-from-research-held-neuroscience-back-and-could-do-so-again"&gt;&lt;u&gt;possible sex differences in the drug's actions were not explored&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond testing metformin's effects on five diabetes patients, Ogawa said he has finished a larger, gold-standard trial in humans to further study the drug's impacts on the gut. The researchers haven't completed the analysis, but as of yet, they haven't seen any sex differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morrice suggested that future work could explore how metformin affects glucose excretion in mice that consume different diets, such as high-fat, high-sugar diets, which are linked to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-rhn88Hmv9nojSVPMZSBHv-B99JK5DLXFUsTq8Z4z6qwA0wXTzXd5UN" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-rhn88Hmv9nojSVPMZSBHv-B99JK5DLXFUsTq8Z4z6qwA0wXTzXd5UN slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

However, this effect was only observed in tasks where socially anxious individuals were expected to gain something for another person. In contrast, when the goal was to prevent a loss for someone else, there was no difference between participants with high and low social anxiety. The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2024.100533"&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social anxiety is characterized by an intense fear of being judged, embarrassed, or negatively evaluated in social situations. People with social anxiety often avoid social interactions or endure them with significant distress. Situations that commonly trigger social anxiety include public speaking, meeting new people, or performing tasks while being observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with social anxiety may also experience physical symptoms such as sweating, trembling, a racing heart, or nausea. This condition can interfere with daily life, making it difficult to form relationships, succeed at work, or participate in social activities. Social anxiety typically develops during adolescence and, if left untreated, can persist into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Ye Yang and his colleagues sought to explore the prosocial behaviors of highly socially anxious individuals and compare them to those of individuals with low social anxiety. Previous research has suggested that people with high social anxiety are less likely to engage in prosocial behaviors. For example, they are less inclined to volunteer for tasks that benefit others and tend to be less generous in economic games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tendencies may stem from a fear of negative evaluation, rejection, and embarrassment when interacting with others. Their heightened self-consciousness and avoidance behaviors make it difficult for them to initiate or participate in helping actions, even when they have the desire to do so. Based on this, the study authors hypothesized that highly socially anxious individuals would be less willing to engage in prosocial behaviors in public settings. However, they predicted no significant difference between socially anxious and non-anxious individuals when prosocial behaviors occurred in private contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, 37 university students with high social anxiety and 36 with low social anxiety participated. Their average age was around 20 years. Each participant completed two blocks of 80 trials designed to measure prosocial behavior. One block took place in a private setting (i.e., the participant was alone in a room wearing headphones), while the other was conducted in a public setting, where two observers (one male and one female) were present, and audio feedback was provided through speakers instead of headphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within each block, half of the trials required participants to exert effort for personal gain, while the other half required effort to benefit another person (who was fictional, though participants were unaware of this). The effort-based task involved repeatedly pressing the “Q” key on a keyboard as quickly as possible within a five-second window to earn increased monetary rewards, with the number of key presses determining the payout. Participants could either accept a default outcome, which required no effort, or engage in the key-pressing task. The number of key presses was recorded as an indicator of effort. During these tasks, participants wore an electroencephalography (EEG) device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same participants took part in a second experiment with a similar procedure. However, instead of gaining rewards, the task focused on preventing losses. If participants chose not to exert effort, they would incur a 90-cent loss, either for themselves or for another person, depending on the trial. If they chose to exert effort—by pressing the “Q” key as many times as possible within five seconds—the loss could be reduced by up to 10 cents if they were successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first experiment revealed that participants with high social anxiety were more likely to exert effort for themselves than for others. In contrast, those with low social anxiety exerted effort equally in both scenarios. However, when exerting effort, low-anxiety participants were more successful at securing gains for themselves than for others. Meanwhile, participants with high social anxiety performed equally well when securing gains for themselves and for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second experiment showed that all participants were more willing to exert effort to prevent their own losses than to prevent losses for others. However, unlike in the first experiment, there were no significant differences between participants with high and low social anxiety in the amount of effort they expended to avoid loss. Additionally, the public versus private context had no effect on behavior in either experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While social anxiety diminishes individual prosocial behavior, evaluative anxiety and sensitive action goals can mitigate its impact to some extent. These findings are critical for developing strategies to enhance psychological health and promote healthier social interactions,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the links between social anxiety and prosocial behaviors. However, it is important to note that the study involved relatively small monetary gains and losses, minimal effort requirements, and fictional beneficiaries of prosocial behavior. If the stakes had been higher—such as requiring greater effort or involving real individuals known to the participants—the results might have been different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2024.100533"&gt;Social anxiety undermines prosocial behaviors when required effort,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Ye Yang, Yan Zhou, Huijuan Zhang, Hui Kou, Jia Zhao, Jiangli Tian, and Cheng Guo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 14:10:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOTW55VGcyZU9DeWduY1F0UTh6bTF1dnM0STV3c2I3MTRrZEstTW02SFVhOWVLOGIzR2hYNkNYdFNnT1N2NUpiZmFCREx5d0pMdlBUdW5YQXNoa2o3dGhJWDdRM05nRmd1UmsxWEw4NElUa21fWVVlZnpHcXM1am9aTHV0N0hLUllKVkUwdENR</guid></item><item><title>Early sign of dementia risk could be keeping you up at night - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOUDNKbGtQbVNDQkl1bTJUa1pTeXR6cEhiU0FOTWJLbjZ2OFZuNDB6Q21MeHdhakRsS2FwdWlrcGp2WkUxSm80Y0hlZ2cyalpLNDI4SDdxQVZPeHUxNGdYRnFadmUwM2p3MGw1RzhYYWM1c3A3ZGNleGllR3AzQURUSnVtZ1lQd9IBiwFBVV95cUxQejNtMWJKMEtCQVFJSjZraVRHVHFwUGtFeTVaRXA0cHp3ejZkYUN3U3RDN1ZkNzRvRExONGhxd2xlc3JZcUdXeGc1V2k2TnYzLW1kb0RLWGlBTzBCeTRmQ3g5Y29WTEhYeWs3bWZ4OURpX2VEd2wwbDBsdUt2cGYwUl9iYUtZa0pvR29N?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One early sign of an increased dementia risk could be leading to interrupted sleep, according to a recent study. A 2022 study conducted by Abidemi Otaiku, a NIHR Academic Clinical Fellow in Neurology at the University of Birmingham, discovered that having frequent bad dreams and nightmares, especially ones that wake you up at night during middle or older age, may be linked with an increased risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abidemi discovered that middle-aged people who experienced nightmares every week were four times more likely to experience cognitive decline over the following decade. While older participants were twice as likely to be diagnosed with dementia if they regularly had nightmares.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The link between dreams and dementia was found to be much stronger for men than for women. The study found that older men who had nightmares every week were five times more likely to develop dementia compared with older men reporting no bad dreams. While for women the increase was 41% instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Explaining the study in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-sign-of-dementia-risk-may-be-keeping-you-up-at-night" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Science Alert&lt;/a&gt;, Abidemi said: "These results suggest frequent nightmares may be one of the earliest signs of dementia, which can precede the development of memory and thinking problems by several years or even decades – especially in men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31167119" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;strong&gt;Brent Chapman&lt;/strong&gt; first heard his doctor suggest surgically implanting one of his own &lt;strong&gt;teeth into his eye&lt;/strong&gt; to restore his vision, he admits he felt apprehensive. But after speaking to an Australian woman who had undergone the procedure and was now &lt;strong&gt;skiing&lt;/strong&gt; after 20 years of blindness, he knew he had to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Now, Chapman is part of history, as Canada performs its&lt;strong&gt; first-ever osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis (OOKP),&lt;/strong&gt; also known as the &lt;strong&gt;tooth-in-eye surgery&lt;/strong&gt;. This remarkable procedure is giving hope to patients with severe corneal blindness—people who, like Chapman, have run out of options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the surgery works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/tooth-in-eye-surgery-canada-1.7470626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;According to CBC&lt;/a&gt;, The OOKP procedure is as unusual as it is groundbreaking. It is done in &lt;strong&gt;two stages&lt;/strong&gt;, months apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;First, a tooth is extracted, reshaped, and fitted with a plastic optical lens. The tooth, usually a &lt;strong&gt;canine&lt;/strong&gt;, is selected because dentine is the &lt;strong&gt;hardest biological material&lt;/strong&gt; the human body produces, making it an ideal foundation for a lens. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once modified, the prepared tooth is temporarily implanted into the patient’s &lt;strong&gt;cheek&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing it to develop&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;blood vessels and soft tissue, which will help it integrate into the eye later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the patient’s eye is prepared for the transplant. Surgeons remove &lt;strong&gt;scar tissue from the cornea&lt;/strong&gt; and replace it with a small &lt;strong&gt;flap of tissue &lt;/strong&gt;from the inside of the cheek, which acts as a protective cover. This step is crucial, as it creates an environment in which the implanted tooth will function successfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A few months later, the tooth-implant is removed from the cheek and&lt;strong&gt; sewn &lt;/strong&gt;into the front of the eye. The result is a &lt;strong&gt;pink eye with a small, black circular opening&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing the patient to see through the implanted lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why use a tooth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea of putting a tooth in an eye may sound bizarre, but there’s solid medical reasoning behind it. According to &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Greg Moloney&lt;/strong&gt;, the ophthalmologist leading the Canadian surgeries, the dentine in teeth is uniquely strong and biocompatible, making it the perfect casing for a&lt;strong&gt; lens&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike artificial implants, which often trigger &lt;strong&gt;immune rejection&lt;/strong&gt;, a patient’s own tooth is naturally accepted by the body. This dramatically increases the chances of long-term success—a crucial factor, given that &lt;strong&gt;94% of patients&lt;/strong&gt; in a 2022 Italian study maintained their vision for an&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;average of&lt;strong&gt; 27 years&lt;/strong&gt; post-surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A last-resort procedure, but with life-changing results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;tooth-in-eye&lt;/strong&gt; surgery is not a &lt;strong&gt;miracle cure&lt;/strong&gt; for all types of blindness. It is specifically designed for patients with corneal blindness due to autoimmune diseases, chemical burns, or severe scarring. The key requirement is that the retina and optic nerves must still be functional.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of the complexity and intensity of the procedure, it is &lt;strong&gt;only performed on one eye&lt;/strong&gt;. Additionally, the surgery comes with &lt;strong&gt;risks&lt;/strong&gt;, including infections that could lead to total vision loss, surgical complications requiring additional operations, and, in rare cases, failure of the implant requiring removal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, for patients like Chapman, the risk-reward balance is clear. Having spent 20 years enduring over&lt;strong&gt; 50 eye surgeries&lt;/strong&gt;, with only temporary improvements, he is willing to bet everything on this last hope for sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

(Submitted by Phil Chapman)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canada’s first tooth-in-eye surgery clinic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before now, Canadian patients needing OOKP surgery had to travel abroad. That is about to change. Dr. Moloney, who has already performed seven successful&lt;strong&gt; OOKP surgeries &lt;/strong&gt;in Australia, hopes to establish the first dedicated Canadian clinic at &lt;strong&gt;Mount Saint Joseph Hospital &lt;/strong&gt;in &lt;strong&gt;Vancouver&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;$430,000 &lt;/strong&gt;in donations from the St. Paul’s Foundation, the clinic will be funded for the first three years, after which Providence Health Care will integrate it into its annual budget.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Samir Jabbour&lt;/strong&gt;, an ophthalmologist at the Centre hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal, calls this a &lt;strong&gt;“great opportunity for Canadian medicine.”&lt;/strong&gt; He notes that while OOKP is rare, having the option available within Canada will significantly ease the burden on patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A second chance at life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Brent Chapman, the &lt;strong&gt;dream of sight&lt;/strong&gt; is within reach. If his final surgery succeeds, he looks forward to finally doing the things he once loved—playing basketball, traveling, and seeing the world again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully, this will break some ground,” he says. “If others in Canada need this, and it becomes an established treatment, I’d feel really great about that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Well, as Politico pointed out, RFK Jr. posted this on Instagram: ‘Afternoon mountaineering above Coachella Valley.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:247NKP2J5FD2VH7GFH3XGR5PUE" data-fusion-component="247NKP2J5FD2VH7GFH3XGR5PUE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:247NKP2J5FD2VH7GFH3XGR5PUE" data-fusion-component="247NKP2J5FD2VH7GFH3XGR5PUE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CMFFBJTN2VEGXMRJD6DOCC2L6A"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leslie, do the optics of this look terrible, especially when RFK has only been in the job for 10 minutes?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="24XOYOAN35BN3BIGJF2KYGN3C4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leslie Marshall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;: Absolutely. And this is exactly why, not just those on the left, but many on the right, didn’t want this man to be in charge of any kind of health program. And this is what happens, Howie, when you have fear-mongering and you make science the enemy, and that’s what happened during COVID. So now we have men, women and children who will contract things like measles that were practically eradicated here in the United States and will die. We’ve already seen deaths, and there will be more. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="STUQVVP7U5GCJLPU4R7WZ4UW5E"&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’m not trying to be, you know, dramatic, but you know that these are the facts that we’re facing with or hearing from the medical community. And it’s shameful. Science is not political. Science is just that, and we need that, especially when it comes to health for the better health of our nation. And that’s not a Democratic or Republican talking point. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SDHVQXTCWRBBDLBIVOJMG6XKUA"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kur&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;tz&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;: I’ve been critical of Kennedy’s lifelong crusade against vaccines. His top spokesman quit after two weeks because he didn’t like the way he was handling the measles business. But also, he’s just an oddball character, and that picture from California is just blatantly tone-deaf.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TITL42K56ND2HNT2BT2BSWUAK4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mary Katherine Ham&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;: Yeah, I think it is, and he should illustrate that he’s on top of this crisis in the proper way, if we were, you know, in normal times. But the idea from Leslie that science is not political, coming from a Democrat after COVID is, frankly, laughable.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NWC4YSXF75G7LJF4F77YY2EYU4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6HXQIJKT65B3TNUD2XJSQPDRUU"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marshall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;: I’m sorry, but it’s RFK Jr., it’s the Republicans that were demonizing vaccines, not Democrats, and that demonization of vaccines led to so many people choosing not to vaccinate themselves and their children, and that’s why we’re seeing people’s bodies being lowered into the ground with measle deaths, which is unheard of, that that I’m sorry I’m not put, can’t put that on my party. ... Please get vaccinated.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KTDVKN2LYJC5HF2V7KBXWDP2SI"&gt;Last week, an unvaccinated adult infected with measles died in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PSQRFMK7RNCCJMBDI2LHLIMPNM"&gt;The person was from Lea County, just across the state line from the West Texas region where 159 measles cases have been identified and a school-age child died the prior week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DVKL24XC3RCGJJVC5KWDV5FFL4"&gt;Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours.

   &lt;p&gt;Think of a time when someone did something really nice for you, or you did something really nice for them. Just bringing up that memory probably makes you feel good — about that person, the nice thing that happened and maybe about some other stuff too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Jessica Borelli, a professor of psychological science at University of California, Irvine, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31999188/" target="_blank"&gt;has developed a technique&lt;/a&gt; that focuses on these kinds of memories to help people feel more secure in their relationships. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Relational-Savoring-Reflection-Strengthen-Relationships/dp/1433840677" target="_blank"&gt;Relational savoring&lt;/a&gt; encourages clients to take a deep dive into these meaningful moments. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Through &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35549365/" target="_blank"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38533758/" target="_blank"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt;, it's been shown to be an effective intervention for strengthening family bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

He has spent decades trying to understand how we can intensify and extend the feelings we get from positive experiences.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;This was a somewhat radical concept in psychology when Bryant began his research in the 1980s. There were plenty of people looking into coping, which is how we process negative experiences, but no one was doing the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was assumed if a good thing happened, you would feel happy. But we all know people who don't know how to enjoy themselves," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And we as humans tend to excel at finding the downside of any situation, Borelli adds. "Our brains are hardwired to think about negativity," she says. "That's probably because of evolution. We focus on where the smoke is coming from. But it doesn't leave time for us to think about positive moments."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research has linked the practice of savoring with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27247114/" target="_blank"&gt;greater well-being&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27247114/" target="_blank"&gt;lower negative mood&lt;/a&gt;. It's part of &lt;a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2015/08/positive-emotions-your-health" target="_blank"&gt;a growing body of evidence&lt;/a&gt; that accentuating positive emotions can be critical for your mental health.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Hopefully, you caught NPR's recent Stress Less series that explored several skills — including savoring — that when practiced for a few minutes a day &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/04/nx-s1-5316220/blah-buoyant-skills-improve-mood-optimism-stress-reduction" target="_blank"&gt;help tamp down anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. (If not, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/series/g-s1-24355/stress-less" target="_blank"&gt;catch up on it here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More research is needed to fully &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.771698/full" target="_blank"&gt;understand these connections&lt;/a&gt; and how to take advantage of them, Bryant notes. But in the meantime, here are some ways to tap into the power of savoring for yourself and everyone you love.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;1. Build up the anticipation&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first person to introduce Bryant to savoring was his mom, who was always planning what she called "joy adventures" when he was a kid. What Bryant learned was that even the mere idea of these experiences was fun, and looking forward to them allowed him to savor in advance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Just like you might read a travel guidebook before boarding a plane to get in the mood for vacation, you can plan ahead for spending time with family and friends and get excited for whatever is on the agenda. "With my granddaughter, we make lists of what we're going to do together. Those are joy menus," says Bryant. He says he likes to leave a blank space "for the joy of surprise."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you have a big family gathering to attend, you could choose to worry about whether your uncle will make tasteless jokes. Or, Borelli says, you could focus on the fact that it's a rare opportunity to get everyone together. "What are the most important things for you to get out of this experience?" she says. Coming into the event with a goal of creating lasting family memories will put you in the right mindset for actually being able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;2. Hop on a time machine&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of Bryant's favorite savoring techniques is to mentally fast-forward himself into the future. For example, when spending an afternoon with that 7-year-old granddaughter, he'll imagine it's 20 years later and she's all grown up. Then he tells himself that now he has the chance to go back to this moment, and what was already a special experience becomes imbued with even more meaning.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I'm approaching it as if it were a reality that is now gone," he says. "When you see it as a second chance, you savor it more."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even a not-so-pleasant experience, like dealing with a toddler tantrum, can transform when you view it as a blast from the past. "This is fleeting. It will not last," Bryant says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to learn better ways of managing stress? Sign up for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/stress-less" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR's Stress Less newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and get five advice-packed newsletters over five weeks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3. Use all of your senses&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When I listen to a piece of music, I close my eyes to focus on it," Bryant says. "I'll do that at a gathering with my family. I'm transported above the event and listen to the blend of voices, joy cascading through the moment."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Catching every detail — how things look, sound, smell, taste and feel — makes it easier to recall memories later and relive that positive experience. "The first step in being able to savor something is to be attuned to what's happening," Borelli says. That's why the relational savoring intervention asks clients to set the scene when they discuss a memory. "It's everything they can remember, like a camera," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Borelli also recommends taking pictures, which you can share with others and turn into mementos.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;4. Remember to look back&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The key to savoring, Bryant says, is that it requires effort. "You have to make time for it. Bad things force us to deal with them. We have little choice about coping," he explains. But we have to decide &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; savor and &lt;em&gt;what to&lt;/em&gt; savor.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When Borelli is helping clients find memories to explore, they often land on a moment that didn't seem that important at the time. For example, a kid falls down at a playground and the parent rushes over to hold them, offer comfort and wipe away tears. "As a parent, you don't get to pause and think that was special," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But those hugs can be an invaluable gift that helps kids feel more secure. She has parents reflect on what that experience means for their connection now and in the future, and if it brings up any thoughts about this relationship or any others in their lives. "This is where the magic happens," Borelli says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And, hopefully, it helps lead them to more memories to savor down the road.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vickyhallett.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vicky Hallett&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a freelance writer who regularly contributes to NPR.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The nonprofit tracks health care quality and costs statewide and issued its &lt;a href="https://mncmsecure.org/website/Reports/Community%20Reports/Summary%20Report/2023MY_Summary%20Report_QDC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://mncmsecure.org/website/Reports/Community%20Reports/Summary%20Report/2023MY_Summary%20Report_QDC.pdf"&gt;annual update&lt;/a&gt; and clinic scores late last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;The percentage of patients with optimized management of their diabetes is the highest since the measure was revised in 2017. Fourteen of 20 measures of clinical quality improved by significant margins in 2023, including the rates of screening patients when recommended for colon cancer and depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Even a percentage point increase on these measures means hundreds or thousands more patients are receiving better care, said Jess Donovan, MNCM’s chief executive. “Every step forward counts.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Despite the progress, Minnesota clinics fell below the state’s goal of keeping diabetes under control for at least 50% of their adult patients. Had clinics collectively met that target, another 14,000 Minnesotans would have had their diabetes in check, reducing risks for heart and kidney failure, eye damage and other complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Performance varied dramatically. Entira Family Clinics locations in the Twin Cities and Gundersen Health System clinics in southeast Minnesota kept 57% of adult patients with diabetes at optimal health.

Dr Eric Berg DC issued the warning on his YouTube channel, which boasts of 13 million subscribers, in a new video titled: "&lt;span&gt;This Was DESTROYING My Life". &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Berg specialises in healthy ketosis and intermittent fasting. He is the author of the best-selling book The Healthy Keto Plan, and is the director of Dr Berg Nutritionals. He no longer practices, but focuses on health education through social media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The health expert says cortisol, which is a stress hormone, should be at its lowest point at 2am, but for some, it’s at its highest. This can cause night waking and other sleep problems that can really interfere with your day. Magnesium can help regulate cortisol levels, a hormone that the body releases when stressed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He recommends that people get checked by a doctor if they have low levels of magnesium, as a deficiency can cause issues with cortisol and sleep. Sharing his own health battle with poor sleep, he said: "How do you go back to sleep if for some reason you wake up between 2-3am in the middle of the night?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I would consider myself an expert in insomnia because I had this for over a decade and it was destroying my life. It was not just getting up at 2-3am in the morning, sometimes I wouldn't even sleep for one minute the entire night, I would lay there. It was basically torture.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What's unique about 2am is something called the circadian rhythm with cortisol. Cortisol should be at the lowest point in this rhythm at 2am and the highest point at 8am. For me everything was backwards I was very awake at 2am, but I was extremely tired at 8am in the morning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I tried everything, I even tried prescription medications, it didn't work. In fact what I didn't know at the time was those medications actually worsen and raise your cortisol."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Poor sleep is linked to conditions such as cardiac problems, dementia, and diabetes. Explaining what can help lower cortisol, Dr Berg said: "One big one is magnesium. Magnesium has the ability to lower cortisol and your cortisol can actually go up if you're deficient in magnesium."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38703902/#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20subgroup%20analyses%20revealed,60%20years%20and%20without%20depression." rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Research indicates that magnesium can help lower cortisol levels&lt;/a&gt;. A magnesium deficiency can lead to elevated cortisol, the body's stress hormone. When you don't have enough magnesium, your stress response can be heightened, although research on this topic can be mixed and further studies are needed to fully understand its impact. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Key points about magnesium and cortisol:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31166556" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="publication-theme-indicator"&gt;
&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;Higher levels of magnesium in the body are associated with better sleep&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Berg continued: "If you're watching right now and you have any tightness in your muscles - your upper back, lower back or if you point your toe and it cramps - that's a sure sign that you are deficient in magnesium. The type of magnesium that I would recommend taking is something called magnesium glycinate. It can help relax your muscles and reduce cortisol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You want to take it at night before you go to bed. Towards the later part of the morning, right around 6am, is when you have the least amount of magnesium in your tissues, this is also probably why a lot of health problems occur in the early morning - like heart attacks, stroke restless leg syndrome, because a lot of these things are influenced by magnesium.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"One last indication of magnesium deficiency is twitching, so if you're getting this twitch underneath your eye or your arm that's a sure sign that you are deficient in magnesium. Magnesium controls calcium and when you don't have enough magnesium you get more calcium and the calcium just causes cramping in different areas of the body."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is magnesium?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Magnesium plays a crucial role in our bodies, aiding metabolism, energy utilisation, muscle function, and protein usage. While it's uncommon to have a magnesium deficiency, it can happen in individuals who have difficulty absorbing magnesium due to factors like surgery, severe burns, malabsorption issues, specific medications, or low calcium levels in the blood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Magnesium-rich foods include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Soy products (milk, flour, tofu)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Legumes and seeds&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Nuts (almonds, cashews, Brazil nuts)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Peanuts and peanut butter&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Whole grain breads and cereals (brown rice, millet)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fruit (bananas, dried apricots, etc.)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Vegetables, particularly dark green, leafy vegetables (artichokes, chard, beet greens, avocados)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dried beans (lima, black-eyed peas, navy)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31166574" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Low magnesium levels can lead to sleep difficulties, such as insomnia and various sleep disruptions. This essential mineral plays a key role in managing the body's biochemical processes and circadian rhythms, aiding in falling asleep and maintaining restful sleep. Magnesium promotes relaxation by inhibiting certain neurotransmitters that activate the body while boosting those that have a calming effect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with digestive diseases, diabetes, alcohol dependence, and older adults are most at risk of magnesium deficiency. Symptoms of magnesium deficiency can include low mood, fatigue, headaches, constipation, heart palpitations, numbness, anxiety, irritability, nausea, weakness, twitching, cramping, or cardiac arrhythmia. If you have any, you should consult your doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Magnesium supplements may help improve insomnia symptoms. Magnesium glycinate may help with anxiety, insomnia, and stress, while magnesium chloride may help relax the nervous system. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8996025/#:~:text=Mg%20may%20play%20a%20role%20in%20sleep,glutamatergic%20and%20gamma%2Daminobutyric%20acid%20(GABA)%20ergic%20system.&amp;amp;text=Moreover%2C%20studies%20have%20shown%20that%20Mg%20supplementation,nervous%20system%20[13]%20and%20potentially%20better%20sleep." rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Research suggests that taking magnesium supplements could improve the time it takes to fall asleep&lt;/a&gt;, enhance sleep quality, and alleviate insomnia symptoms, particularly in older individuals who have low magnesium levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have been diagnosed with a magnesium deficiency, it is wise to speak to your doctor to check if you can take magnesium supplements. If you regularly suffer from poor sleep, let your GP know as soon as possible to rule out any other possible medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What else can cause poor sleep?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31166591" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Berg added: "Low blood sugar can increase cortisol and cause you to wake up at night. If your diet is high in carbs, your blood sugar may decrease while sleeping, and your body will increase cortisol levels to normalize your blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"If you’re waking up at 2am, evaluate what you ate the day before. Refined starches, MSG, alcohol, snacking, and eating late can disturb sleep. Salt cravings can signify a sodium deficiency. Sodium helps lower cortisol, so add more sea salt to your meals throughout the day if you’re having salt cravings."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are a few other sleep tips that can help you sleep better at night:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Avoid suspense and action movies before bed&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Avoid blue light before bed&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Get plenty of sunlight during the day&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Go for long walks&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Exercise to release excess energy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The health expert also said: "The liver detoxifies the body between 1am and 3am. Night waking during this time frame could signify a problem with the liver. Milk thistle before bed can help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Restless legs syndrome can be related to a B1 or magnesium deficiency. Lower your carb intake and increase your consumption of these nutrients. A high pulse rate could signify a potassium deficiency, which can also interfere with sleep. Apple cider vinegar before bed can help stabilise blood sugar for better sleep, but make sure it’s diluted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 12:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxORlUxLWRWdUl6ZWdIc1NveFpxMTFWN2xBVG5saE1IQkJUQnpWczdQbmxWYnNvYjAwMGduaXBxUmlOSUNTTmlsWVFldl9obEd1TEhNbnE5Wjl0bFZqSUdhY3JaNDhIVHFfMUYyZklPOE1qS2RNdnVaUW5jX0JTbE5wQmNB</guid></item><item><title>Researchers discover hidden link between gut bacteria and arthritis - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQRWZubmNaWENvS2dBOTZHVGJRQmNSSDBldlc4aDRZSHR4TFNiMkhWdk5LZWctVlVJQkJBUHp6YlJFbXNYUFJqTEE4aHhLN0JTUDU5ZkxKRzNqVnlBcXJ6czR3NldDejVXLXpHcjFIQTBNSndDODFOSDUxZXJkbjM4VFQ0ZGxfeVZRUGR3WFdOMXcyblh4UkVOdVgzaVhtejlGMHJnLWtnMjZkZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-rheumatoid-arthritis-vaccine-offers-new-hope-for-millions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt; (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) are progressive inflammatory conditions that cause joint damage over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic factors play a role in both diseases, but they do not fully explain who develops arthritis. Environmental factors, including smoking, increase the risk, particularly in genetically susceptible individuals. Now, new research suggests that gut bacteria and their byproducts may be a crucial trigger for inflammatory arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_gut_bacteria_influence_arthritis_risk"&gt;How Gut Bacteria Influence Arthritis Risk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have found that people with RA and SpA often show signs of microbial imbalances in the gut, a condition known as dysbiosis. In RA, the "mucosal origins hypothesis" suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-protein-that-stops-autoimmune-diseases-and-allergies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; dysfunction starts at mucosal sites such as the intestines before spreading to the joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;CIA was induced in male 6-week-old DBA/1 mice, and cecal contents were harvested at day 35 from mice with CIA, mice with CIA that were depleted of microbiota by antibiotic administration after day 21, or untreated DBA/1 mice (Untx DBA).

Recent findings also highlight a particular strain of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-discover-new-link-between-gut-bacteria-and-alzheimers-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, Subdoligranulum, as a potential RA trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, about half of SpA patients exhibit intestinal inflammation at the microscopic level. This has led researchers to explore the "gut-joint axis"—the idea that immune disturbances begin in the gut and later impact the joints. However, the precise mechanisms linking gut bacteria to arthritis remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_key_discovery_tryptophan_breakdown_and_indole"&gt;A Key Discovery: Tryptophan Breakdown and Indole&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study from the &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado&lt;/a&gt; sheds light on how gut bacteria contribute to arthritis. Led by Kristine Kuhn, MD, PhD, researchers identified a connection between tryptophan metabolism and inflammation. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid obtained from food, aiding in protein synthesis, muscle growth, and neurotransmitter production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/167671" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/a&gt;, found that when gut bacteria break down tryptophan, they produce inflammatory byproducts such as indole. In experiments with mice, those given antibiotics to remove their gut bacteria did not develop arthritis or produce indole. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when mice were fed a diet low in tryptophan, they also remained free of arthritis. These findings suggest that microbial breakdown of tryptophan into indole plays a critical role in triggering the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed that indole increases inflammatory T-cells while reducing regulatory T-cells, which normally help maintain immune balance. Indole also enhances the production of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifesaving-antibody-treatment-could-revolutionize-heart-transplants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inflammatory antibodies&lt;/a&gt;, worsening immune system attacks on the joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="potential_for_new_treatments"&gt;Potential for New Treatments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the role of tryptophan metabolism in arthritis opens new possibilities for treatment. Kuhn and her colleagues propose that blocking indole production or shifting tryptophan metabolism toward anti-inflammatory pathways could provide relief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Graphical abstract representation of the study and it's findings.

Research suggests that fiber-rich, plant-based diets, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/green-mediterranean-diets-can-significantly-reduce-body-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, promote a gut microbiome that favors anti-inflammatory tryptophan metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond dietary changes, the Division of Rheumatology at the University of Colorado is working on ways to identify people at high risk for RA. By detecting specific blood markers, researchers hope to develop early interventions that could prevent or slow the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although much work remains, this research could lead to new therapeutic approaches that mitigate arthritis before irreversible joint damage occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connection between gut bacteria and inflammatory arthritis highlights the complex interplay between the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/the-isss-sterile-environment-could-be-making-astronauts-sick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;microbiome&lt;/a&gt; and the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By targeting this pathway, scientists may be able to develop treatments that not only manage symptoms but also prevent disease onset altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;CIA was induced in 6-week-old male DBA/1 mice.

For decades, governments have added fluoride to drinking water to protect teeth, believing it to be a simple solution for cavity prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a recent study from &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Karolinska Institutet&lt;/a&gt; in Sweden suggests fluoride exposure – especially in pregnancy and early childhood – could impact brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not the first time this issue has surfaced, but the findings add weight to a long-standing debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fluoride-in-drinking-water"&gt;Fluoride in drinking water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally occurring fluoride is present in many water sources, but its levels are often too low to significantly prevent cavities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, countries such as the USA, Canada, Chile, Australia, and Ireland have long introduced fluoride into their public &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bacteria-strain-identified-that-can-eat-forever-chemicals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;water systems&lt;/a&gt;. The standard level used in these nations hovers around 0.7 mg per liter, which is considered optimal for dental health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its widespread use, the addition of fluoride to drinking water has remained a topic of debate. Health officials argue it is a cost-effective public health measure, but concerns about potential side effects persist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the concern about health risks, the addition of fluoride to drinking water is controversial and has been widely debated in the USA and Canada,” said Maria Kippler, associate professor at Karolinska Institutet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results support the hypothesis that even relatively low &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/is-water-fluoridation-still-effective/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;concentrations of fluoride&lt;/a&gt; can impact children’s early development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracking-fluoride-exposure"&gt;Tracking fluoride exposure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how fluoride affects brain development, scientists focused on a rural area in Bangladesh. Here, fluoride naturally seeps into the water supply, just like in many other regions worldwide. They followed 500 mothers and their children for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By studying these families over time, researchers could observe how fluoride exposure influenced thinking and learning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists tested urine samples to check fluoride levels in mothers and children. Unlike toothpaste, which isn’t swallowed, most fluoride comes from drinking water and food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the children turned five and ten, the researchers tested their cognitive abilities using trusted psychological methods. The goal was to see if fluoride &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/too-much-fluoride-in-tap-water-supply-might-lower-kids-iq-by-few-points/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;levels&lt;/a&gt; played a role in shaping their thinking and reasoning skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fluoride-exposure-and-its-effects"&gt;Fluoride exposure and its effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were concerning. The median concentration of fluoride in the urine of pregnant women in the study was 0.63 mg/L. Higher levels of fluoride in mothers were linked to lower cognitive abilities in their children at both five and ten years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d like to stress that dental care products such as toothpaste are not normally a significant source of exposure since they are not intended for ingestion,” said Dr. Kippler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fluoride in toothpaste is important for prevention of caries, but it’s important to encourage small children not to swallow the toothpaste during brushing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At age ten, children with more than 0.72 mg/L of fluoride in their urine showed significant cognitive deficits compared to those with lower levels. The most affected areas were verbal reasoning and sensory processing, essential skills for learning and communication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alarmingly, these effects were observed at fluoride levels below the current World Health Organization (&lt;a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;) and European Union (&lt;a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/index_en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;) drinking water safety threshold of 1.5 mg/L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-complex-impact-on-development"&gt;Complex impact on development &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, fluoride &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/what-happens-to-our-teeth-as-we-age-new-details-have-emerged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;levels&lt;/a&gt; in five-year-olds did not strongly correlate with cognitive abilities. “This may be due to the shorter exposure time,” said Dr. Kippler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But also to the fact that urinary fluoride concentrations aren’t as reliable in younger children owing to greater variations in how much fluoride is taken up and stored in the body, particularly in the bones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps younger children process fluoride differently, or maybe it takes longer for the effects to become noticeable. Either way, this part of the study highlights how complex fluoride’s impact on development might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-long-term-effects-of-fluoride"&gt;Long-term effects of fluoride &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found strong links, but it can’t prove fluoride directly causes these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fully understand how fluoride affects cognitive abilities, more longitudinal studies are needed. The researchers plan to examine this issue in other populations and develop experimental models to explore the potential biological mechanisms at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a need for more research to create a robust basis for reviewing fluoride health risks and thresholds for drinking water, foods, and dental care products, especially for children,” said Dr. Kippler. “Even small changes in cognition at a population level can have serious public health consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since many people are exposed to fluoride, it’s important to understand its risks. Protecting teeth matters, but experts must also consider if fluoride affects brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study received financial support from the &lt;a href="https://www.vr.se/english.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Swedish Research Council&lt;/a&gt; and the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences, and Spatial Planning (&lt;a href="https://www.era-learn.eu/network-information/organisations/swedish-research-council-for-environment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FORMAS&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP14534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Environmental Health Perspectives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:32:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxOS1dHTGFjaF9oaDF5VUVCanA4TkNUUTNqZTVMSXpvd3I4QkNNZ0UtdjFrdHpnZEoxY2JCemIxNWdoWXFxRklYZm50ZFM2ZnZCRk9UVm81VkE5Rm8yRWlhYm5fNjc5Rm9EVDBSRWY2WmtGS2twMmNHLUdVbjVHQ05JMlZnVW9XNGQ1RFBLOG9YMVBONGhBUDA0</guid></item><item><title>Menopause Therapy Linked to Alzheimer's Marker - Newsmax</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mainArticleDiv" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Hormone replacement therapy during menopause appears to be linked to a toxic brain protein that’s a hallmark of &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/neurology/alzheimers-disease-what-it-is-causes-symptoms-stages-treatments-prevention"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women over 70 had a faster accumulation of tau in their brains if they’d taken hormone therapy for menopause symptoms more than a decade before, according to a new report in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/sciadv.adt1288"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tau tangles are one of the hallmarks associated with Alzheimer’s, researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers did not find a significant difference in their accumulation of amyloid beta, another toxic protein linked to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Approximately a quarter of currently postmenopausal women who are 70 years and older have a history of HT use and have now entered a critical age of risk for Alzheimer’s disease,” senior researcher &lt;a href="https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/14689912/Rachel-Buckley"&gt;Rachel Buckley&lt;/a&gt;, a cognitive neuroscientist with Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But researchers found that hormone therapy among younger women did not appear to be linked with increased tau accumulations — supporting the notion that it should be safe early in menopause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our findings add to the evidence that delaying initiation of hormone therapy, especially in older women, could lead to worse Alzheimer’s outcomes,” Buckley said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers compared brain imaging from 73 women who’d used hormone therapy an average of 14 years earlier with 73 age-matched women who had not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants underwent PET scans for amyloid beta over an average 4.5 years, and for tau an average 3.5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women 70 or older who used hormone therapy showed faster tau accumulation in specific regions of their brain, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our data indicate that hormone therapy may influence tau accumulation as a function of age, with implications for cognitive decline,” lead researcher &lt;a href="https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/26289384/Gillian-Coughlan"&gt;Gillian Coughlan&lt;/a&gt; with Massachusetts General Hospital said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We hope that our study will help to inform Alzheimer’s disease risk discussions relating to women’s reproductive health and treatment,” Coughlan added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Generally, healthy adults should aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic (cardio) activity each week — this is often broken down into 30 minutes a day, five days a week — or 75 minutes of high-intensity cardio each week. And the key components of a healthy exercise routine also stay more or less the same: cardio, strength or resistance training, balance and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But where you may want to diverge in later life, loosely defined as mid-60s and onward, is to focus more on strength, balance and flexibility. Here’s why and how:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Balance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The number one emphasis in terms of exercise in an elderly patient has been balance,” said Dr. Laura Wedderburn, an internist at Sutter East Bay Medical Group who treats older patients. “Balance is something I’ve seen the consequences of us not doing — meaning falls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rates of fall-related deaths in the U.S. have been increasing for years, as the baby boomer generation ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better balance can help lower the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/dianne-feinstein-fall-injury-18287521.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;falls&lt;/a&gt; and fractures. And having better balance is associated with longer life expectancy. One 2022 study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that in adults ages 51 to 75, being able to stand on one leg for at least 10 seconds is correlated with improved longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wedderburn suggests simple balance exercises you can do at home, such as a heel-to-toe walk, where you try to walk in a straight line for the length of a room. You can also stand on one leg while holding onto the kitchen counter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="embed" data-server-side-rendered="true" class="e1ogmilg x100 f fdc aic mb32"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One good test is whether you can get up from a chair without using your arms to help, said Dr. Deborah Kado, a Stanford geriatrician. If you can do that safely, to assess balance, try standing with your feet close together, then standing with one foot slightly in front of the other, then with one foot in front of the other like you’re walking a tightrope. If that’s doable, try closing your eyes while putting one foot in front of another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One can always continue working on improving balance and avoiding being sedentary,” Kado said. “These are things that generally should not cause injury and are so important for maintaining function and mobility as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you work out regularly — especially with yoga, tai chi or Pilates, which all include balance elements — you’re probably already doing balance exercises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What works best, practically speaking, is incorporating it into your exercise routine,” said Dr. Robert Nied, a sports medicine specialist at Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People do yoga on a deck overlooking India Basin at India Basin Waterfront Park in San Francisco last October. Experts recommend yoga to help improve balance and flexibility, which are important for maintaining function and mobility as people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brontë Wittpenn/The Chronicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Flexibility&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balance and flexibility, or lack thereof, are closely tied, experts said. Many older adults have become inflexible because starting in young adulthood, they spend most of their days sitting in front of a computer and not stretching, Wedderburn said. That contributes to tendons becoming inflexible, back pain and stiffness — which later in life can make you more prone to falls and other injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spine injuries stemming from back stiffness are common, said Dr. Michael Fredericson, a sports medicine specialist at Stanford. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As you get older, the spine is always going to be a culprit,” he said. “A lot of people come in with different spine injuries that become more apparent as they exercise. A lot of people get very stiff in their back as they get older. That sets them up for injury when they start to exercise in a way that maybe they’re not used to and their body isn’t pliable enough to adapt to it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To combat this, experts encourage older adults to do tai chi and yoga — even if it’s just a quick downward dog when you get out of bed in the mornings, or a five-minute Youtube yoga video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wedderburn herself used to run often and train for half marathons. Now 52, she walks three to four days a week for at least half a mile and uses a rowing machine, which she said is easier on her knees. She also does about 15 minutes of yoga on alternating days; a couple of days a week, she does nothing except walk her dog. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training — whether it’s with weights, resistance bands or cables, or body weight — is critical for aging well, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Good Brigade/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More frequent strength training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength training generally means resistance training, whether it’s with weights, resistance bands or cables, or body weight. It is “probably the most important thing” for aging well, Nied said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I see lots of patients that are over 60 that are very active,” he said. “The number one thing I see is not enough strength training. Lots of people do cardio — swimming, biking, walking, dancing. But strength is a component I think is under-realized how much that becomes important as you get older.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommendation for all adults is to do resistance training twice a week. But older adults should do it more frequently — three times a week for a 65-year-old, and four times a week for those 75 and older, Nied said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because resistance training — lifting close to fatigue, using about 80% to 90% of muscle strength and endurance — activates or “turns on” the mTOR gene (mechanistic target of rapamycin), which plays an important role in protein synthesis and contributes to muscle building and strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you get older, the duration the mTOR gene “stays on” gets shorter, going from three days in a younger person to two days in older adults, then one to two days after age 75, Nied said. So older adults have to work out more frequently to get the same benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, adults start losing muscle mass around age 50, with men declining at a faster rate than women, Nied said. People also start losing strength and use type II “fast twitch” muscle fibers less; this type of muscle fiber is used in short, fast, powerful movements. This loss can be reversed somewhat with resistance training. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The general rule is 50% of loss of strength can be reversed by weight training,” Nied said. “Not getting bigger, simply using the muscles consistently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nied, 53, surfs, skis, snowboards and plays soccer. About 10 years ago, he said, he “had to start taking my own advice” and started resistance training three times a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wedderburn, the Kaiser internist, said weights don’t necessarily have to be very heavy to offer some benefits. She urges older patients to weight train a few times a week, even if it’s just for five minutes at a time while watching television or waiting for the microwave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pick up your dumbbells or gallon of milk and do reps,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lighter weights pose less risk for tendon injuries and muscle tears since tendons can get more rigid with age, she said. An exception may be for an older adult who’s consistently lifted heavy weights for decades and whose muscles are more accustomed to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re starting in your 30s and 40s and maintaining, at 65 you’re well ahead of the game from other sedentary 30 or 40-year-olds,” Wedderburn said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It’s never too early or too late&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts emphasized it’s never too early for younger adults — or too late for older adults — to adopt some of these practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why would you wait until you start to lose your balance before you start working on it?” said Fredericson, of Stanford. “You should always be working on your balance. But particularly as you get older because we tend to lose it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fredericson, 66, has practiced martial arts for most of his life and teaches karate and tai chi. They challenge your balance and coordination and are functional exercises, he said, helping train your body with movements you do in everyday life.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults start losing bone density between ages 30 to 40, and the loss accelerates after 65, said Dr. Wynnelena Canio, a Kaiser geriatrician who practices in Petaluma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why if you get into these things as your routine earlier on, they’ll be less likely to affect you as you get older,” said Canio, who is in her late 40s and takes HIIT classes, a combination of strength and cardio, five to six days a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it’s also never too late to start training. One study that Kado likes to cite when she gives talks is a JAMA &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2342214/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from 1990 that showed that when 10 nursing home residents in their 80s and 90s did eight weeks of high-intensity resistance training, they improved their quadricep strength, started to walk faster, were able to climb stairs better, and improved their balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Seek social connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of studies show that having social connections are just as important, if not more important, than diet and exercise when it comes to overall health and wellness. Loneliness was recently declared a public health &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/feeling-alone-ways-combat-loneliness-isolation-18076892.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt;, and older adults who live alone can be especially at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts encourage group fitness classes or working out with a friend, which can give you social interaction and help motivate you to be active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because of social isolation and loneliness, my biggest push right now is to get folks to join clubs, whether they’re walking clubs, rowing clubs, going bowling, gardening clubs,” Wedderburn said. “Get out, go meet other people, and you’re getting activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p class="cci_endnote_contact" title="CCI End Note Contact"&gt;Have questions or concerns about aging and fitness?

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ifmo000v2cntas752g43@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Six years ago, two communities in New York – one in Brooklyn and one in Rockland County – were facing the worst measles outbreaks the United States had seen in decades. Measles had been declared eliminated from the country in 2000, but 2019 brought the nation the closest it has been to losing that status.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l00043b6m1n5skq61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, measles outbreaks are growing in West Texas and New Mexico. Testing sites and vaccine clinics have opened in outbreak areas and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Texas last week to support the response. Still, local health officials say spread could continue for months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7zp5qm800013b6mgl7h4j1i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Back in 2019, swift, sustained efforts to curb the measles virus brought the country back from the brink. The response centered on the unique needs of communities that were most at risk, powered by hands-on public health work that was supported by formal policy changes. Experts say the way the outbreak played out in New York underscores the importance of an all-hands-on-deck approach to stop the spread in other outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7zqx16q00093b6m0slo34h3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The outbreaks in New York, which started at the end of 2018 and persisted through most of 2019, were concentrated in Orthodox Jewish communities that had been targeted with anti-vaccine disinformation for years.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7zquo0g00073b6m79j8knwe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Public health experts who were part of the on-the-ground response say that building trust within the community was perhaps the most important part of their work because it created opportunities to better utilize the most important tool available: vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l00063b6mu90lai77@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vaccination is the most important way to prevent the devastating disease that measles can be,” said Dr. Neil Vora, executive director of Preventing Pandemics at the Source, a coalition of organizations focused on reducing risk from novel viruses. He was heavily involved in responding to the measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 as a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employee working out of the New York City health department at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l00073b6m304swctp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the measles vaccine are 97% effective at preventing disease, and immunity from the shot is long-lasting. Because measles is so contagious, federal health agencies say that a 95% vaccination rate is needed to prevent outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l00083b6mylq5h799@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thousands of people were vaccinated in New York during the outbreaks – at least 200,000 doses in New York City and about 30,000 in Rockland County, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/25/health/measles-outbreak-over-rockland-county-ny/index.html"&gt;officials told CNN&lt;/a&gt; was three times more than the annual baseline. Vaccine promotion efforts raised rates among young children in the Brooklyn neighborhoods affected by the outbreak from less than 80% to about 91%, according to one &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;. But the process took time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l00093b6mxx4slwn6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We were up against quite a bit of resistance in terms of getting people vaccinated as quickly as we would have liked,” said Dr. Oxiris Barbot, president and chief executive officer of the United Hospital Fund, a nonprofit organization focused on improving health care in New York City. She was the city’s health commissioner during the measles outbreak between 2018 and 2019.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000a3b6m7vdlzf5u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it took more time than we would have anticipated, but that just really spoke to the degree of how hardened the disinformation had become in that community and what we were fighting against,” she said. “That’s why it’s so important to rely on trusted messengers to make it easy for people to get vaccinated and to have leaders that lead with the importance of vaccination. I can’t really overstate the importance of that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000b3b6mahxl1xre@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            New York City also benefited from a strong vaccine registry that helped public health workers identify the people who were most at risk and focus their efforts, Vora said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000c3b6mcboahame@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One of my big concerns is that other jurisdictions in the country are not as well-resourced as we are in New York City, so when they face outbreaks, they’re going to have even more trouble than we had in getting those outbreaks under control,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000d3b6mj094a2in@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The work required a highly individualized approach, with workers knocking directly on doors and making time to answer questions about vaccination one-on-one, Barbot said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000e3b6mtsfeqqvv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There were certainly many people where we went to their homes to be vaccinated. There were instances where we went in essentially undercover, so that their neighbors wouldn’t know that they were getting vaccinated,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000f3b6mxxmgpx44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The measles vaccine can build immunity quickly – it takes just a few weeks to reach its full effectiveness – and the efforts in New York paid off.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000g3b6mgi143ou8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A retrospective modeling &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaz4037" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that vaccination campaigns during the measles outbreak in New York City averted an even larger spike in cases. The outbreak could have been at least 10 times worse than it was, with up to 8,100 people infected instead of the 649 cases reported by the city, according to the report by Dr. Wan Yang, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000h3b6m208nhh4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But once an outbreak starts, experts say, increasing vaccination rates isn’t the only factor to consider. Findings from Yang’s study also suggest that “measles parties” – where children are brought together to intentionally spread the disease with the goal of creating immunity – accelerated spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000i3b6m9tmk5z79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Infants are typically most susceptible to a measles infection because they are typically not eligible to be vaccinated until age 1. At the beginning of the outbreak in September 2018, Yang’s work suggests, more than half of infants in the community were susceptible, along with about a quarter of young children between the ages of 1 and 4 who were the second most susceptible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000j3b6mdv6x4exw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The initial vaccination campaigns lowered susceptibility rates by about 10 percentage points by the end of December, and the efforts “appeared to effectively contain the outbreak at the time,” according to Yang’s study; estimates suggest that each new case was linked to just one additional case at the end of the year, low enough to potentially avoid an epidemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000k3b6mao7c6mqs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the chains of transmission grew quickly in the early months of 2019, faster than changes in susceptibility from vaccination rates could explain, suggesting that close contact rates were had increased, especially among young children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000l3b6mfmlebgad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles outbreaks are “dynamic,” Yang said. “It’s not just susceptibility that is determining how many new cases you are going to get. It also has to do with how people are interacting with each other.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000m3b6myf2fuzat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data shows that were surges in the numbers of vaccines administered at certain key points: around the start of the school year, for example, and when the city issued a mandate that children living in certain ZIP codes be vaccinated to attend school or day care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000n3b6mpdahpded@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This intensive work required a persistent, all-hands-on-deck approach, Barbot said. The only situation that required a comparable amount of dedicated staff and time was the Covid-19 response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000o3b6mgszu3k3x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April 2019, about five months after the initial measles cases were reported in New York, officials in both New York City and Rockland County declared a state of emergency due to measles – a move that was also quite extraordinary before the Covid-19 pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000p3b6m3ddvr1tz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The emergency declaration gave us the resources that we needed on an ongoing basis to make sure that lack of resources wasn’t a reason why we couldn’t bring the outbreak to an end,” Barbot said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000q3b6m82l2fn99@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But official mandates and emergency declarations supported the more informal work that had already been happening on the ground, experts say. Strong relationships that were forged between public health workers and trusted community leaders helped with broader communication strategies to dispel disinformation about the vaccines, as well as misconceptions about measles being a benign disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000r3b6maz4eyx3e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Blima Marcus, a nurse practitioner at the Bellevue Hospital Center, used her expertise as a health care provider and a member of the Orthodox Jewish community to forge inroads with a culturally sensitive approach.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000s3b6meuzt8mvq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that the only thing that really can help is when your own community can find the resources to mobilize and start knocking on doors, literally and figuratively, to reach people where they’re at and start slowly changing the narrative,” she said. “The notion that there’s no one to ask and there are no answers to these deep vaccine questions – that’s false, and [that notion] is part of what we were hoping to change.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000t3b6mcz26rjcz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Marcus helped develop a &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/a-slice-of-pie.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;pamphlet&lt;/a&gt; with information about the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine that was distributed to about 10,000 homes, a plan specifically designed to address anti-vaccination messaging that had been infiltrating the community and to reach individuals who might be less inclined to find information through digital media.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000u3b6mctobk4l1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She and other community members knew that they had to be nimble in responding to a rapidly changing situation – strategically addressing misinformation as it arose and focusing on particular parts of the community most in need – and they were often moving faster than formal government systems would allow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000v3b6mhce0rqzo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even if you have emergency funding, it’s not as emergent as we actually need,” Marcus said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000w3b6m7bldj2kw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the outbreaks were declared over, Rockland County had &lt;a href="https://www.rocklandcountyny.gov/departments/health/communicable-diseases/measles#:~:text=The%20outbreak%20was%20declared%20over,2019%20and%20mid%2DMay%202019." target="_blank"&gt;312 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; and New York City had 649. No deaths from measles were reported during the outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7zoy86z00003b6migl92kma@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The current outbreaks haven’t reached that size yet. This year, nearly 230 measles cases have been identified in outbreaks in West Texas and a nearby New Mexico county, with the first case confirmed about a month and a half ago and two deaths of people with measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000x3b6mbg41xkqi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Much of the current outbreak is concentrated among a tight-knit &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/west-texas-measles-outbreak/index.html"&gt;Mennonite community&lt;/a&gt;, which faces some similar vulnerabilities as the Orthodox Jewish communities in New York did.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000y3b6mh5qsihrt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What I felt was very effective in making connections, in forging inroads and, ultimately, in many places, increasing immunization rates is having that culturally competent teamwork because people are averse to being told what to do by others who they feel don’t understand them or their belief systems,” Marcus said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ifmo000v2cntas752g43@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Six years ago, two communities in New York – one in Brooklyn and one in Rockland County – were facing the worst measles outbreaks the United States had seen in decades. Measles had been declared eliminated from the country in 2000, but 2019 brought the nation the closest it has been to losing that status.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l00043b6m1n5skq61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, measles outbreaks are growing in West Texas and New Mexico. Testing sites and vaccine clinics have opened in outbreak areas and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Texas last week to support the response. Still, local health officials say spread could continue for months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7zp5qm800013b6mgl7h4j1i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Back in 2019, swift, sustained efforts to curb the measles virus brought the country back from the brink. The response centered on the unique needs of communities that were most at risk, powered by hands-on public health work that was supported by formal policy changes. Experts say the way the outbreak played out in New York underscores the importance of an all-hands-on-deck approach to stop the spread in other outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7zqx16q00093b6m0slo34h3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The outbreaks in New York, which started at the end of 2018 and persisted through most of 2019, were concentrated in Orthodox Jewish communities that had been targeted with anti-vaccine disinformation for years.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7zquo0g00073b6m79j8knwe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Public health experts who were part of the on-the-ground response say that building trust within the community was perhaps the most important part of their work because it created opportunities to better utilize the most important tool available: vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l00063b6mu90lai77@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vaccination is the most important way to prevent the devastating disease that measles can be,” said Dr. Neil Vora, executive director of Preventing Pandemics at the Source, a coalition of organizations focused on reducing risk from novel viruses. He was heavily involved in responding to the measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 as a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employee working out of the New York City health department at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l00073b6m304swctp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the measles vaccine are 97% effective at preventing disease, and immunity from the shot is long-lasting. Because measles is so contagious, federal health agencies say that a 95% vaccination rate is needed to prevent outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l00083b6mylq5h799@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thousands of people were vaccinated in New York during the outbreaks – at least 200,000 doses in New York City and about 30,000 in Rockland County, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/25/health/measles-outbreak-over-rockland-county-ny/index.html"&gt;officials told CNN&lt;/a&gt; was three times more than the annual baseline. Vaccine promotion efforts raised rates among young children in the Brooklyn neighborhoods affected by the outbreak from less than 80% to about 91%, according to one &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;. But the process took time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l00093b6mxx4slwn6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We were up against quite a bit of resistance in terms of getting people vaccinated as quickly as we would have liked,” said Dr. Oxiris Barbot, president and chief executive officer of the United Hospital Fund, a nonprofit organization focused on improving health care in New York City. She was the city’s health commissioner during the measles outbreak between 2018 and 2019.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000a3b6m7vdlzf5u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it took more time than we would have anticipated, but that just really spoke to the degree of how hardened the disinformation had become in that community and what we were fighting against,” she said. “That’s why it’s so important to rely on trusted messengers to make it easy for people to get vaccinated and to have leaders that lead with the importance of vaccination. I can’t really overstate the importance of that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            New York City also benefited from a strong vaccine registry that helped public health workers identify the people who were most at risk and focus their efforts, Vora said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000c3b6mcboahame@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One of my big concerns is that other jurisdictions in the country are not as well-resourced as we are in New York City, so when they face outbreaks, they’re going to have even more trouble than we had in getting those outbreaks under control,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The work required a highly individualized approach, with workers knocking directly on doors and making time to answer questions about vaccination one-on-one, Barbot said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000e3b6mtsfeqqvv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There were certainly many people where we went to their homes to be vaccinated. There were instances where we went in essentially undercover, so that their neighbors wouldn’t know that they were getting vaccinated,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000f3b6mxxmgpx44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The measles vaccine can build immunity quickly – it takes just a few weeks to reach its full effectiveness – and the efforts in New York paid off.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000g3b6mgi143ou8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A retrospective modeling &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaz4037" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that vaccination campaigns during the measles outbreak in New York City averted an even larger spike in cases. The outbreak could have been at least 10 times worse than it was, with up to 8,100 people infected instead of the 649 cases reported by the city, according to the report by Dr. Wan Yang, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000h3b6m208nhh4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But once an outbreak starts, experts say, increasing vaccination rates isn’t the only factor to consider. Findings from Yang’s study also suggest that “measles parties” – where children are brought together to intentionally spread the disease with the goal of creating immunity – accelerated spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000i3b6m9tmk5z79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Infants are typically most susceptible to a measles infection because they are typically not eligible to be vaccinated until age 1. At the beginning of the outbreak in September 2018, Yang’s work suggests, more than half of infants in the community were susceptible, along with about a quarter of young children between the ages of 1 and 4 who were the second most susceptible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000j3b6mdv6x4exw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The initial vaccination campaigns lowered susceptibility rates by about 10 percentage points by the end of December, and the efforts “appeared to effectively contain the outbreak at the time,” according to Yang’s study; estimates suggest that each new case was linked to just one additional case at the end of the year, low enough to potentially avoid an epidemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000k3b6mao7c6mqs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the chains of transmission grew quickly in the early months of 2019, faster than changes in susceptibility from vaccination rates could explain, suggesting that close contact rates were had increased, especially among young children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000l3b6mfmlebgad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles outbreaks are “dynamic,” Yang said. “It’s not just susceptibility that is determining how many new cases you are going to get. It also has to do with how people are interacting with each other.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000m3b6myf2fuzat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data shows that were surges in the numbers of vaccines administered at certain key points: around the start of the school year, for example, and when the city issued a mandate that children living in certain ZIP codes be vaccinated to attend school or day care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000n3b6mpdahpded@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This intensive work required a persistent, all-hands-on-deck approach, Barbot said. The only situation that required a comparable amount of dedicated staff and time was the Covid-19 response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000o3b6mgszu3k3x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April 2019, about five months after the initial measles cases were reported in New York, officials in both New York City and Rockland County declared a state of emergency due to measles – a move that was also quite extraordinary before the Covid-19 pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000p3b6m3ddvr1tz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The emergency declaration gave us the resources that we needed on an ongoing basis to make sure that lack of resources wasn’t a reason why we couldn’t bring the outbreak to an end,” Barbot said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000q3b6m82l2fn99@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But official mandates and emergency declarations supported the more informal work that had already been happening on the ground, experts say. Strong relationships that were forged between public health workers and trusted community leaders helped with broader communication strategies to dispel disinformation about the vaccines, as well as misconceptions about measles being a benign disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000r3b6maz4eyx3e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Blima Marcus, a nurse practitioner at the Bellevue Hospital Center, used her expertise as a health care provider and a member of the Orthodox Jewish community to forge inroads with a culturally sensitive approach.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000s3b6meuzt8mvq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that the only thing that really can help is when your own community can find the resources to mobilize and start knocking on doors, literally and figuratively, to reach people where they’re at and start slowly changing the narrative,” she said. “The notion that there’s no one to ask and there are no answers to these deep vaccine questions – that’s false, and [that notion] is part of what we were hoping to change.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000t3b6mcz26rjcz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Marcus helped develop a &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/a-slice-of-pie.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;pamphlet&lt;/a&gt; with information about the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine that was distributed to about 10,000 homes, a plan specifically designed to address anti-vaccination messaging that had been infiltrating the community and to reach individuals who might be less inclined to find information through digital media.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000u3b6mctobk4l1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She and other community members knew that they had to be nimble in responding to a rapidly changing situation – strategically addressing misinformation as it arose and focusing on particular parts of the community most in need – and they were often moving faster than formal government systems would allow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000v3b6mhce0rqzo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even if you have emergency funding, it’s not as emergent as we actually need,” Marcus said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000w3b6m7bldj2kw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the outbreaks were declared over, Rockland County had &lt;a href="https://www.rocklandcountyny.gov/departments/health/communicable-diseases/measles#:~:text=The%20outbreak%20was%20declared%20over,2019%20and%20mid%2DMay%202019." target="_blank"&gt;312 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; and New York City had 649. No deaths from measles were reported during the outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7zoy86z00003b6migl92kma@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The current outbreaks haven’t reached that size yet. This year, nearly 230 measles cases have been identified in outbreaks in West Texas and a nearby New Mexico county, with the first case confirmed about a month and a half ago and two deaths of people with measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000x3b6mbg41xkqi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Much of the current outbreak is concentrated among a tight-knit &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/west-texas-measles-outbreak/index.html"&gt;Mennonite community&lt;/a&gt;, which faces some similar vulnerabilities as the Orthodox Jewish communities in New York did.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7z9ir7l000y3b6mh5qsihrt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What I felt was very effective in making connections, in forging inroads and, ultimately, in many places, increasing immunization rates is having that culturally competent teamwork because people are averse to being told what to do by others who they feel don’t understand them or their belief systems,” Marcus said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

I’ve never said so to her—she probably doesn’t share my view that hot toddies are great cold remedies, but to each her own, right? But how do I respond politely to her offer to “treat” me? She’s not inclined to take a simple “Thanks, but no” for an answer. I don’t want to be hurtful, and I do appreciate her kindness, but I’m really not interested.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;E.G. /&lt;/b&gt; Boston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Try what psychologists call a placebic excuse: a sentence that sounds reasonable on the surface but actually lacks information. (The classic version of this is “Can I use the copier ahead of you? I need to make some copies.” Believe it or not, this works, while merely asking people if you can cut the copier line does not. Note that there is not much else one can do with a copier but make copies.) Your version might sound something like “I’m on a path with my [lupus/misaligned chakras/IBS] and I don’t want to wander off that.” “On a path” is a deeply meaningful phrase to the kinds of people who believe in alternative medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;If she continues to push, tell her that you have different opinions about health and you would prefer not to discuss your areas of disagreement. But don’t tie yourself in knots trying to avoid offense. People who won’t take a simple “no” for an answer — or a simple “yes,” for that matter — have only themselves to blame when they eventually hear something they’d rather not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;An acquaintance asked me to lunch, his treat. We ate at a restaurant that I frequent often, and I left a generous tip because the service was great and my “friend” was a total jerk to the waiter. When Mr. Congeniality saw the size of the tip, which the cheap [expletive] thought was too much, apparently, he actually walked back to the table and picked up and pocketed half of it! What would you do? I was gobsmacked and speechless. I haven’t seen him or returned his calls since.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;P.B. /&lt;/b&gt; Windsor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The first thing you ought to do, which you probably have, is to return to the restaurant and give the server the rest of tip, along with an apology for your lunch date’s behavior. You’re a regular at this joint, I take it, and you mustn’t let your former friend alienate you from a place where you enjoy that comfortable status.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;What you should have done when your friend pocketed the tip was to say, “Did you just take the tip I left on that table?” in your outside voice. One of the most effective ways to stop bad behavior in its tracks is simply to name it: “Did you just call me ‘Sugarlips’?” “Is this your backpack on the priority seat?” Your “friend” would huff and puff defensively. You then would say, authoritatively, “Put it back.” Once you have named the offending behavior, you state a preferred alternative with equal brevity and clarity: “My name is Allison.” “I’m disabled and need this seat.” All eyes would be on your friend as he shamefacedly returned the tip. Wouldn’t you have been the hero! Of course, had I been in the situation, I probably would have stood there gobsmacked and speechless myself. The vast majority of people would, so don’t beat yourself up over it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And you have my blessing to either cut Mr. Congeniality off with no explanation or to give him a piece of your mind. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

As a result, vigilance is important for canine caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;″‘If you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras,’ is a saying I learned in veterinary school,” Dr. Jo Myers, a veterinarian with veterinary telehealth company Vetster, told HuffPost. “It’s a reminder that most of the time, something common is going on. This means that when your dog does something unusual, it’s unlikely to be something serious or rare. However, there are some situations that warrant more urgent attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, HuffPost asked Myers and other experts to identify the signs and changes they would never ignore in a dog. Read on for 13 things to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Cough That Lasts More Than A Couple Of Weeks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We often associate coughing with colds or the flu, but a persistent cough can signal something more serious, like heart disease,” Myers said. “While dogs can get upper respiratory infections that cause coughing, they typically go away within a couple of weeks, often without treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your dog’s cough lasts more than a couple of weeks, however, you’ll want to seek medical attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dogs of any age can be affected by several different kinds of heart conditions that lead to congestive heart failure, often with few noticeable early signs,” Myers noted. “In many cases, a lingering cough ― especially one that doesn’t respond to treatment for an infectious disease ― is the first sign of serious heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexplained Weight Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unexplained weight loss in dogs is concerning because it’s uncommon and often linked to serious underlying conditions,” Myers said. “While weight loss due to a decreased appetite occurs frequently with many common illnesses, significant weight loss in a dog that is eating normally and not vomiting or having diarrhea is far less typical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recommended checking with a veterinarian if you have concerns about your dog’s weight fluctuation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a dog starts losing weight unexpectedly with no clear cause, I’m concerned about a potentially serious underlying issue, such as an unusual infection, a blood disorder or cancer,” Myers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Respiratory Rate And Effort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a dog or cat is having trouble breathing, especially if they haven’t had a period of intense exercise, this is concerning for underlying health conditions,” said &lt;a href="https://www.vet.upenn.edu/people/faculty-clinician-search/KAITLYNKREBS" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Katie Krebs" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67acec93e4b02322707886ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.vet.upenn.edu/people/faculty-clinician-search/KAITLYNKREBS" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Dr. Katie Krebs&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of clinical primary care at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. “When an animal is resting, you can count their breaths and look at their respiratory effort.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the event that your dog’s breathing rate is elevated while resting, you should consider further evaluation by a veterinarian.

This may occur when your dog is eating dinner, for example, and suddenly stiffens or begins staring at the person approaching.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted that this behavior is often rooted in a dog’s past negative experiences, like never having had their own blanket or needing to defend their food from other dogs in their home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The behavior may even extend to a person the dog is especially attached to and protective of,” Williams said. “While it’s only natural to be protective of things that are important to us, this behavior can become dangerous if the dog is becoming aggressive, such as lunging or biting. For example, if you or someone in your family cannot go near your dog’s food bowl for fear of your dog biting, it may be a good idea to speak with an animal behavior specialist, who can help you and your dog develop a plan to work on the resource guarding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Sore, Swollen Or Closed Eye&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If your dog has a sore, swollen or closed eye, this must never be ignored,” said &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=67acec93e4b02322707886ff&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trustedhousesitters.com%2Fblog%2Fauthors%2Frebecca-macmillan%2F" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Rebecca MacMillan" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67acec93e4b02322707886ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=67acec93e4b02322707886ff&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trustedhousesitters.com%2Fblog%2Fauthors%2Frebecca-macmillan%2F" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Rebecca MacMillan&lt;/a&gt;, a veterinarian with TrustedHousesitters. “Many different eye conditions can cause serious problems if left untreated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She listed corneal ulcers, glaucoma and foreign bodies in the eye as examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these conditions are very painful and if left untreated could cause your pet to lose their vision,” MacMillan said. “I have seen dogs lose an eye on more than one occasion because treatment was delayed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Breath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bad breath should never be dismissed as just ‘doggy breath,’” MacMillan said. “It is not normal and could be an indication of dental disease or other oral diseases, like a tumor or a foreign body. We can also see bad breath in kidney failure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if your dog seems to be otherwise OK, it’s still worth looking into canine halitosis and having your vet check on their teeth during visits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Take a good sniff of your dog’s breath,” advised &lt;a href="https://www.wellnesspetfood.com/blog/get-to-know-wellness-natural-pet-food-veterinarian-dr-danielle-bernal/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Danielle Bernal" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67acec93e4b02322707886ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.wellnesspetfood.com/blog/get-to-know-wellness-natural-pet-food-veterinarian-dr-danielle-bernal/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Danielle Bernal&lt;/a&gt;, a veterinarian with Wellness Pet Food. “While a dog’s breath is unlikely to smell minty fresh like ours, you want to check to see if it is pungent, a key sign that dental disease is present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted that &lt;a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/riney-canine-health-center/canine-health-information/periodontal-disease" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="studies suggest" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67acec93e4b02322707886ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/riney-canine-health-center/canine-health-information/periodontal-disease" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; at least 80% of dogs, particularly seniors and small dogs, suffer from dental disease. That’s why you want to pay attention to bad breath, as well as teeth color, gum color and gum texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Never ignore the state of your pet’s teeth and gums, as they contribute mightily to their overall health,” Bernal said. “If left unchecked, poor dental hygiene can progress to periodontal disease, which can potentially impact your pet’s heart, kidneys and even liver. Dental issues can not only cause pain and infection, but also eating issues and weight loss that lead to more problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Appetite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have Labrador retrievers, and if they stop eating, then I know something is wrong,” Krebs said. “In dogs that are highly food motivated, not wanting to eat or take treats is usually a sign of something systemic or that they are in pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For dogs who are a little pickier with their food, one or two skipped meals on occasion is less of a cause for concern, but you should never ignore a prolonged decrease in appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Poor appetite or a reluctance to eat can also signal gingivitis, gum disease or periodontal disease,” Bernal noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, pay attention if your dog can’t seem to get enough water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Excessive drinking or urination can be a sign of diabetes, kidney disease or hormonal disorders,” said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/dogtordulake/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Michelle Dulake" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67acec93e4b02322707886ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/dogtordulake/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Dr. Michelle Dulake&lt;/a&gt;, a veterinarian and co-founder of pet supplement company Fera Pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Edwin Tan via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Edwin Tan via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;A dog that is suddenly skipping meals and/or showing signs of weakness and fatigue might be dealing with a serious underlying issue. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lethargy Or Weakness &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If your dog is suddenly less active, refuses to play or seems weak, it could be due to pain, infection or metabolic disorders,” Dulake said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dog who is more tired than usual might be exhibiting subtle signs of joint pain due to osteoarthritis. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/courtney-pierce-dvm-mba-a18075b8/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Courtney Pierce" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67acec93e4b02322707886ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/courtney-pierce-dvm-mba-a18075b8/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Dr. Courtney Pierce&lt;/a&gt;, a canine pain medical lead with animal health company Zoetis, recommended being on the lookout for early indicators like difficulty going up or down stairs, lagging on walks, hesitation to jump up or down and limping after exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Often, my clients will say to me, ‘He’s doing OK, he’s just slowing down a little,’” she said. “And while I certainly don’t want my older dog acting like a puppy when it comes to things like chewing up my shoes or forgetting his manners, ‘slowing down’ is not a change I welcome or ignore. Almost 40% of dogs suffer from pain associated with [osteoarthritis] but it often goes undiagnosed until the condition is very advanced.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although osteoarthritis is often considered a disease of old age, Pierce emphasized that this is not accurate and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10838335/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="pointed to research" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67acec93e4b02322707886ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10838335/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;pointed to research&lt;/a&gt; finding that about 39% of dogs between 9 months and 4 years of age showed radiographic signs of the condition in at least one joint&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My own dog was diagnosed with osteoarthritis when he was just 4 years old when I noticed he didn’t want to run and play with my children like he used to,” she explained. “Thankfully, because I didn’t ignore the signs, we were able to get him started on pain relief and a weight management program right away. Now we can look forward to many more happy and active years with him!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recurring GI Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An occasional upset stomach in an otherwise healthy dog is usually not a cause for concern,” Myers said. “Most cases of vomiting or diarrhea from eating something unusual resolve on their own within a day or so. However, when a dog shows intermittent appetite loss, vomiting or diarrhea over time, it raises a red flag.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if each episode seemingly resolves on its own, recurring GI issues over weeks or months can signal a bigger underlying issue, which could include pancreatitis, a food intolerance or allergy, gastrointestinal obstruction or kidney and liver disease. Bloodwork and abdominal imaging can help vets identify the cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any time blood is noted, that’s not something to be ignored,” Krebs said. “If there is blood in vomit or diarrhea, the dog or cat should probably be evaluated by a veterinarian.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood could indicate an infection, poisoning or other gastrointestinal problems. Be similarly mindful of abdominal distension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is especially relevant for large and giant breed dogs, but abdominal distension, or an outward appearance of bloating, can be a life-threatening medical condition,” Krebs said. “When I see dogs with bloated abdomens, that’s something I would take them to the vet right away to determine if more significant interventions are required. This becomes even more significant when accompanied by vomiting and abdominal pain.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a dog is limping this means that they are in pain, even if they are still eating and not crying out,” MacMillan said. “So many owners turn a blind eye to this, especially if their dog seems well otherwise and the limp is mild or intermittent. But it is important to remember that a limp is not normal behavior and there must be something causing it which needs investigating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limping can indicate an injury or an illness like Lyme disease and certain immune-mediated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My biggest concern, however, is lameness of a single leg accompanied by an increasingly larger area of swelling near the knee, shoulder or wrist,” Myers said. “Those locations are frequently affected by the most common type of primary bone cancer in dogs: osteosarcoma.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection can allow for intervention before the tumor grows large enough to cause significant issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to limping, other ways dogs might indicate they are in pain include difficulty getting up, reluctance to sit or having more accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Little dogs may show signs of pain in not wanting to be picked up,” Williams added. “If you notice these signs in your dog, it’s important to call your veterinarian and determine if you should bring your dog in to be seen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Enlarged Lymph Nodes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lymph nodes are essential to a healthy immune system, swelling as they respond to nearby infections,” Myers said. “For example, if you have a head cold, you might notice swollen glands under your jaw.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs similarly have lymph nodes that swell and feel like little round balls under the skin around their armpits, jaws, backs of the knees and groin areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While localized swelling often indicates infection, some conditions cause lymph nodes throughout the body to enlarge,” Myers said. “One of the most frequent cancers in dogs, lymphoma, is a common cause of generalized lymph node enlargement. Although typically seen in middle-aged and older dogs, lymphoma can develop in dogs as young as 1 year old. Other medical conditions can also cause generalized lymph node enlargement, but lymphoma is a primary concern.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sudden Behavior Changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Increased aggression, confusion or withdrawal may signal pain, illness or neurological disorders,” Dulake said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted that other behaviors like persistent scratching might indicate allergies, parasites or infections ― especially when accompanied by skin changes or hair loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Owners should also never turn a blind eye to aggressive behavior in their dogs ― it is a clear sign that your dog is not happy about something,” MacMillan said. “Aggression can occur when a dog has underlying pain somewhere, but&lt;br&gt;anxiety, stress or boredom can also trigger this. Definitely don’t wait until&lt;br&gt;someone gets injured before seeking advice for your dog’s behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although dogs will be dogs, owners are responsible for teaching their canines good behaviors and social skills in order to avoid accidental injuries and foster positive interactions with people and other dogs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without appropriate guidance, many dogs either forget or never learn how to have basic manners, leading to problem behaviors including nuisance barking, jumping on people, no impulse control and ‘friendly’ greetings that are actually rude,” Myers said. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collapse Or Seizure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In general, dogs don’t collapse unless there is an underlying medical condition,” Krebs said. “There are a number of things that could cause a dog to collapse, and this becomes more of a medical emergency when the animal loses consciousness or has seizure-like symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Get Our Lifestyle Coverage Ad-Free&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our reporters rely on research, expert advice and lived experiences.

The air was so laden with pollution from coal power plants and cars at the time that it turned the rain toxic. Downpours killed fish, destroyed forests, eroded statues, and damaged buildings, sparking public outcry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Acid rain is a particularly alarming demonstration of the simple adage that what goes up must come down,” former Colorado Senator Gary Hart &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/07/archives/experts-call-acid-rain-growing-problem-in-us.html?searchResultPosition=17"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in 1979. “With acid rain,” he said, “what comes down is much worse than what went up — worse in its potential damage to trees and crops, worse in its potential damage to fresh‐water lakes and fish and tourism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A few decades later, acid rain had largely disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div id=":R22rarr6:" class="duet--article--image-gallery-two-up _1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwx5"&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwx8 _1j8uwx7"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;A statue on the side of a building that’s been weathered, in part, by acid rain, seen in Leipzig, Germany in 1990.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Richard Baker/In Pictures via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwxa _1j8uwx9"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;A forest in Poland that’s been killed off by acid rain.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Christopher Pillitz/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Beginning around 1990, the US and Europe passed legislation that limited the amount of acid-forming pollutants — such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides — that power plants could emit. Laws requiring car manufacturers to put catalytic converters into new vehicles, which reduced harmful emissions, were also taking effect. That brings us to today: While precipitation in &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/acid-rain-environment-earth-day/"&gt;some regions&lt;/a&gt; is still unnaturally acidic, on the whole, acid rain is largely a problem of the past and a major environmental success story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now, however, there’s another problem with our rain — and it’s even more alarming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While precipitation has become less acidic, a growing body of evidence suggests that it’s now full of many other pollutants that pose a risk to public health, including microplastics. And unlike the compounds that cause acid rain, these pollutants are almost impossible to get rid of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-new-pollutants-in-our-rain" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new pollutants in our rain &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As government regulators focused on reigning in air pollution, companies were busy generating new sources of pollution, including plastics and PFAS, the so-called &lt;a href="/2022/8/25/23318667/pfas-forever-chemicals-safety-drinking-water"&gt;forever chemicals&lt;/a&gt;. PFAS, which stands for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a large group of compounds used, among other things, to make fabric stain-resistant and pans nonstick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over time, these modern-era substances — which famously take decades to millennia to degrade — have leached into the environment, reaching every corner of the planet, no matter how tall or deep. Microplastics, PFAS, and some other compounds, such as pesticides, are now so widespread that they’ve essentially become part of our biome, not unlike bacteria or fungi. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;They’re so common, in fact, that they’re even found in the rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0335-5"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969724075090"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, for example, have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389423011664?via%3Dihub"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; microplastics in rain falling all over the world — even in remote, unpopulated regions. For one 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz5819"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science, &lt;/em&gt;researchers documented microplastics in rainwater that fell on several national parks and wilderness areas in the Western US. Most of the plastic bits were microfibers, such as those shed from polyester sweaters or carpeting on the floor of a car. The researchers estimated that more than 1,000 metric tons of plastic from the atmosphere fall on parks in the West each year, including both as rainfall and as dry dust. That’s equivalent to roughly 120 to 300 million plastic water bottles, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The largest source of those microplastics was highways, said Janice Brahney, a biogeochemist at Utah State University who led the &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;study. Roads are often littered with plastic waste that gets broken down by cars and kicked up into the air. Those particles are typically lighter than soil, so once they become airborne, they can easily move around in the atmosphere and get grabbed by rain as it falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;A gull carrying a piece of trash along the San Gabriel River in Southern California.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Mark Rightmire/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Another important source of plastic rain is the ocean, Brahney said. Several million tons of plastic enter the ocean each year, much of which breaks down into microplastics. When waves crash on the beach or bubbles burst on the sea surface, it sends microscopic plastic particles into the air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Plastic rain is an environmental threat that’s harder to fix than the last one. “It’s much worse than the acid rain problem,” Brahney said. “With acid rain, we could stop emitting acid precursors and then acid rain would stop falling. But we can’t stop the microplastic cycle anymore. It’s there and it’s not going away.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The story of PFAS is similarly bleak: Researchers have detected these chemicals in rain across the planet from the US and Sweden to China and even Antarctica, often at levels above drinking water guidelines. For a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1309104224002678"&gt;study published in 2024&lt;/a&gt; — titled “It’s raining PFAS in South Florida” — researchers analyzed rainwater that fell around Miami and found more than 20 PFAS compounds, including PFOS and PFOA. Although these two PFAS were phased out in the US years ago due to public health concerns, the researchers still found them at concentrations beyond government health advisory levels for drinking water, underscoring the remarkable persistence of forever chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For another &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c02765?ref=PDF"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2022, scientists reviewed studies of PFAS in rainwater and similarly found concentrations of these chemicals at levels above what US and Danish regulators say is safe for drinking water. The authors concluded that, based on health advisories, no untreated rainwater would be considered safe to drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“For us to get rid of PFAS, we probably have to go back in time,” said Natalia Soares Quinete, a chemist at Florida International University who was involved in the 2024 study. Even though the government is increasingly regulating PFAS, she said, “I don’t see us completely getting rid of those chemicals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The good news is that most people — especially in wealthy countries like the US — don’t rely on untreated rainwater. What is concerning is that rain ends up in groundwater, rivers, and reservoirs that feed into municipal water systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Treatment plants help a lot, typically &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667010021002432"&gt;removing&lt;/a&gt; upwards of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054062/"&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of microplastics in water, but some still pass through. A study &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/water/article?id=10.1371/journal.pwat.0000250"&gt;published earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found a small amount of microplastics in bottled water and tap water in France. Similarly, typical filtration plants for municipal water remove some but not all PFAS. Authors of a &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/tap-water-study-detects-pfas-forever-chemicals-across-us"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; by the US Geological Survey, a federal agency, estimate that at least 45 percent of the country’s tap water has at least one type of PFAS present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Treatment facilities don’t have the technology to treat all of the microplastic compounds, let alone the technology to measure them, Brahney said. “There are tens of thousands of chemicals involved, and we only understand a fraction of them,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Whether or not you’re at risk from microplastics, PFAS, and other chemicals is all about exposure — how much of those substances you’re breathing in or consuming. There’s not much of them in a single glass of tap or a bottle of water. The problem is that there are many other pathways that these pollutants can take to enter your body, such as through food. And over time they add up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="how-to-protect-yourself-from-polluted-rain" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How to protect yourself from polluted rain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Avoid drinking untreated rainwater and eating snow, no matter how pristine it looks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you can afford to filter your water, you should. Standard filters like reverse osmosis — which runs water through a semi-permeable membrane — typically remove a large portion of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054062/"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41545-023-00286-2"&gt;PFAS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;Opt for tap over bottled water to avoid ingesting microplastics. Tap water is also way &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b00750"&gt;better for the planet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that the human brains contain as much as a typical &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/health/plastics-inside-human-brain-wellness/index.html"&gt;plastic spoon’s worth of microplastic&lt;/a&gt;, by weight. Scientists still don’t understand what impact that might have on human health, but &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00405-8"&gt;they suspect&lt;/a&gt; that microplastics could be linked to cancer, heart and kidney disease, and Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Meanwhile, nearly all Americans have a measurable amount of PFAS in their blood, &lt;a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/hcp/clinical-overview/human-exposure.html"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; US health officials, though concentrations of some of them — including PFOA and PFOS — are declining. On the whole, forever chemicals &lt;a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/hcp/clinical-overview/health-effects.html"&gt;are associated with&lt;/a&gt; a range of ailments including increased cholesterol, decreases in birth weight, and kidney cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;All of these contaminants can also be &lt;a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2024/11/microplastics-are-sickening-and-killing-wildlife-disrupting-earth-systems/"&gt;harmful&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723045643?via%3Dihub"&gt;wildlife&lt;/a&gt;, which unlike most of us, do rely on untreated water. &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/toxicology/articles/10.3389/ftox.2022.1010185/full"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt;, for example, linked exposure to PFAS to impaired immune systems in alligators. “If we have these contaminants in our rainwater they’re getting into our groundwater,” Brahney said. “They’re infiltrating our soils. Every organism is interacting with rainwater.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Ultimately, what all of this research reveals is that the planet is dirty, even if the filth can be hard to see. These chemicals are in the rain because they’re abundant in the environment — and they’re in the environment because they’re in the rain.

&lt;hr class="t-copy has-xxl-vert-marg"&gt;
    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Five years ago, Melanie Richburg used a roll of duct tape, a HEPA filter and a portable fan to draw contaminated air out of a hospital room where patients were tested for the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Now, as the state’s largest measles outbreak in three decades &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/02/18/texas-measles-outbreak-climbs/"&gt;sickens an increasing number&lt;/a&gt; of Texans in the South Plains region, the Lynn County Hospital District, where Richburg serves as the chief executive officer, is still without specialized isolation rooms to treat patients.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;So, she’s prepared to bring out the duct tape again.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“If we see the volume of patients exceeds the number of beds available at children's hospitals, we’re going to need a contingency plan,” said Richburg, whose county is 30 miles south of Lubbock and has had two measles cases. “The biggest struggle we have is the same struggle we had during COVID.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The coronavirus pandemic underscored the need for robust public health infrastructure. And it brought to light a remarkable urban-rural divide in access to basic health services. In the months after the virus ravaged the country, federal dollars flowed to local public health districts, and policies targeting health care deserts saw a renewed push.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Yet as a disease that had been declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 makes a resurgence, rural West Texas communities and state officials are scrambling to respond. Aging infrastructure, a dearth of primary care providers and long distances between testing sites and laboratories plague much of rural Texas, where the measles outbreak has concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;At least 198&lt;/a&gt; people in Texas have been infected with measles since late January, and &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/02/26/texas-measles-death/"&gt;one child has died&lt;/a&gt; from measles, the first such death in the country in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;More measles cases are expected, and the outbreak could last for months, state health services commissioner Jennifer Shuford told lawmakers last week.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Though different from COVID in many ways, measles is similarly revealing how a lack of public health resources leaves rural communities vulnerable. What’s left are local leaders forced to scrape together the few tools they have to respond to an emergency, contending with years of lackluster investment from the state and federal level to proactively prevent emerging public health threats.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We’re in a public health shortage area,” said Gordon Mattimoe, director of the Andrews County Health Department.“ You have to think outside the box.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="c62d8813-07d8-4e87-9cf4-3c68969cbbaa" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Lack of infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Some 64 Texas counties don’t have a hospital, and 25 lack primary care physicians, according to the &lt;a href="https://texasagriculture.gov/Portals/0/forms/ER/RuralHealth/SORH%20Infographic.pdf"&gt;Texas Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;. Twenty-six rural Texas hospitals closed between 2010 and 2020, according to &lt;a href="https://www.torchnet.org/advocacy--rural-hospital-closure.html"&gt;a rural hospital trade organization&lt;/a&gt;, and although closures slowed in the years since, those still standing are often in crumbling buildings with few medical providers.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Swaths of Texas have scant resources for public awareness campaigns. And they lack sufficient medical staff with expertise to provide the one-on-one education needed to encourage vaccination and regular visits to the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We have a difficult time in our area finding pediatricians for our newborns,” said Sara Safarzadeh Amiri, chief medical officer for Odessa Regional Medical Center and Scenic Mountain Medical Center. “That’s a problem. If you can’t find a pediatrician, then when a serious question comes up, who do you ask?”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Most of Texas’ measles cases are in unvaccinated school-aged children and are concentrated in the Mennonite community in Gaines County. Cases have also been confirmed in eight other counties spanning Dallam near the Oklahoma border down to Ector, south of Gaines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;To contain the illness, rural health care teams have cordoned off spaces to conduct measles testing, used social media to blast residents with information about vaccination efficacy and schlepped throat swabs across counties to ship them to a state lab in Austin — the only public state facility that was conducting measles testing until the Texas Tech University Bioterrorism Response Laboratory, part of a national network of CDC-funded labs, began measles testing last Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Testing is critical for measles, experts say, because infected individuals can be contagious for several days and must isolate themselves to avoid spreading it further.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Gaines County, runners have had to drive specimens up to 70 miles to get to a FedEx office where they could ship the specimen to the state laboratory. It could then take another 48 hours to get test results. During that time, public health officials would ask patients suspected of measles to quarantine — but they don’t know if they followed through.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Some people need the test to say ‘I’m positive’ before they actually do something or follow the directions given,” Amiri said. “Having that testing available is very important.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Andrews County, just south of Gaines, Mattimoe is using the old City Hall building as a testing site because he doesn’t have a reverse pressure room.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Those rooms prevent contagious diseases from spreading to other people, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/communication-resources/clinical-diagnosis-fact-sheet.html#:~:text=of%20serious%20complications.-,What%20to%20do%20if%20you%20have%20a%20suspected%20case,must%20use%20N%2D95%20masks."&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; suspected measles patients are treated there when possible. In the absence of such spaces, rural counties including Lynn and Yoakum have improvised a room for measles testing, hoping they don’t get overrun with more patients they can handle.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Mattimoe, who said he is anticipating more cases, opted to open up City Hall for testing since that building happens to be vacant.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;WIthout it, Mattimoe said, he’d have to “shut down the entire department for two hours between suspected cases.”&lt;/p&gt;

 Mark Rogers for The Texas Tribune
        &lt;/cite&gt;
      
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  


    
  
&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;h3 id="2b3fad39-09a3-4ce3-bea2-9ca3a70f5f7e" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Reactive instead of proactive responses&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Public health is based upon prevention, yet it’s emergencies that spur the most action, particularly in rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;It was only after a school-aged child died from measles that state and federal support intensified. Twenty seven contractors were brought into the outbreak area last week to assist local health departments, Shuford, the state health services commissioner, said during a legislative hearing. A public awareness campaign with billboards and social media messaging was also launched. And, upon a request from the state, the federal CDC sent &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/cdc-measles-outbreak.html"&gt;“disease detectives”&lt;/a&gt; to West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;County officials also doubled down their efforts. In Ector County, County Judge Dustin Fawcett made media appearances to discuss the efficacy of the MMRV vaccine whose two doses provide 97% protection against measles. And the commissioners court approved the purchase of a $7,695 freezer to store measles test specimens — samples shipped after the date of collection must be kept at -70 degrees celsius.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      

  &lt;div class="c-plugin c-plugin--giant c-plugin--default c-plugin--flush c-plugin--o-landscape"&gt;

 Mark Rogers for The Texas Tribune
        &lt;/cite&gt;
      
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  


    
  
&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Andrews County, residents stepped up their communal responsibilities. Mattimoe saw a surge of people coming into the clinic to get vaccinated. “Unfortunately, the death of a child was one of the things that spurred many people to come in,” Mattimoe said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Even as state and federal officials are sharing more information on vaccines, experts say those campaigns needed to come sooner. They have known for years that vaccination rates have been declining.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We shouldn't be doing it during an outbreak,” Amiri said. “We should be doing it beforehand to prevent the outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Getting vaccines in residents is further complicated by the fact that Texas has a mostly decentralized system of public health. Cities and counties can stand up their own public health departments or districts, but the majority of rural counties can’t afford to have their own. Instead, they rely on &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/regional-local-health-operations/public-health-regions"&gt;one of 11 public health regions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Those regions cover vast territories with limited dollars and don’t always know the ins and outs of local communities, especially on how to motivate residents to get vaccinated. The logistical challenges of traveling across counties adds another layer of difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“You have to call these tiny towns and figure out who can give you space for free to set up a testing clinic,” Wells said. “Then you’re driving from Lubbock to rural areas and that cuts how long you can keep the clinics open.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;And then, rural public health departments are having to contend with mixed messaging from the federal level as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health and human services secretary, has cast vaccination as a personal choice while downplaying the news of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I think with the changes that are occurring at the federal level, we need to realize that we do need to strengthen our local public health,” Amiri said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="612f07ed-739f-478e-9428-a683950187c7" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;The power of funding&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Years of underinvestment in public health left Texas &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/09/17/texas-coronavirus-health-funding/"&gt;ill prepared for the coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. Hospital equipment was scarce, and state and local health departments had outdated technology that limited access to crucial data.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The pandemic also exposed the rural-urban inequities in health care access. Residents of Texas counties without hospitals died from COVID-19 at 20% higher rates than residents of counties with hospitals, according to &lt;a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2020/12/31/covid-19-death-rates-higher-texas-counties-without-hospitals/4001910001/"&gt;an analysis by the Austin American Statesman.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;An influx in federal funding helped shore up local public health departments and stave off more rural hospital closures. Texas received &lt;a href="https://www.apha.org/-/media/files/pdf/advocacy/speak/sfh_texas.pdf"&gt;$35.5 million in grants&lt;/a&gt; for improvements in public health infrastructure in fiscal year 2020. An additional $221 million — the most of any state — is flowing to Texas through the CDC’s five-year Public Health Infrastructure Grant.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;That funding has helped some local health departments address the measles outbreak, public health officials said. The Lubbock public health department has nearly doubled in size thanks to a $2 million grant. Those extra workers have been on the front lines of testing for measles and vaccinating children.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It moved us from undersized to right sized,” said Katherine Wells, director of the city’s public health department. “It got us to the…health department we need for Lubbock.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Andrews County, Mattimoe has also used grant dollars to grow his health department. Four new employees, including an epidemiologist and a social worker, have helped the county complete a population health assessment that offers a snapshot of residents’ needs. And its year-round vaccine clinics have helped stave off the worst of the measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Community immunity has really saved us,” Mattimoe said. “There will be a case eventually, but there’s something to be said about herd immunity.” Andrews County does not have any confirmed measles cases as of Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The influx of dollars that rural communities received during the height of the pandemic showed the meaningful changes that officials could do with more support, but it still hasn’t been enough.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas spends less on public health per person than the vast majority of other states, according to the &lt;a href="https://statehealthcompare.shadac.org/rank/117/per-person-state-public-health-funding#2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52/a/76/154/false/location"&gt;State Health Access Data Assistance Center&lt;/a&gt;, whose analysis shows Texas spent $17 per person on public health in 2023. A decade earlier, the spend was $19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The low levels of state funding particularly hurt rural communities that have higher rates of uninsured Texans and more senior citizens with greater health needs, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.torchnet.org/uploads/1/1/9/5/119501126/ten_things_hospitals-map_w-photos_final.pdf"&gt;Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals. &lt;/a&gt;Deteriorating buildings and the shortage of medical professionals still persist in rural areas, while lower volumes of patients means higher health care operational costs.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Lynn County, Richburg, the CEO of the health district, had hoped the makeshift contraption she made during COVID for a reverse pressure room wouldn’t be needed again in her rural community of 5,500 people. She attempted to pass a bond last year to pay for infrastructure upgrades, including a mini intensive care unit with four negative pressure rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Voters &lt;a href="https://www.kcbd.com/2024/05/05/voters-reject-lynn-county-hospital-bond/"&gt;rejected the proposed tax increase&lt;/a&gt;, though, a gut punch to Richburg.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We wanted those four specific beds so that when we had situations where we needed to isolate patients, they’d be adequately cared for and not in a room with a broken window with a fan duct taped in it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In addition to isolation rooms, Lynn County’s health care system is due for a major electrical upgrade, Richburg said. The facility’s backup power generator doesn’t cover the MRI machine or the CAT scan. In the meantime, Richburg and her staff plan to do their best with what they have.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We’re still here, the lights still come on every morning, and patients still come in for services,” Richburg said. “We’re not going away.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;As a doctor specialising in neurocognitive medicine and the founder of a brain optimisation clinic in California, Heather Sandison has spent 15 years studying the brain, and she believes that it is important to address nutritional deficiencies to ensure a healthy functioning brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nearly every patient I see leaves with a list of recommended supplements," she told &lt;em&gt;CNBC Make It&lt;/em&gt;, sharing the details of three supplements that Sandison said she recommends "to just about everyone". The doctor, however, suggested getting the supplements checked by a healthcare provider first to discuss if "they are appropriate for you, dosages and possible interactions with any medications you may be taking".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="hide-moblie mid-arti-ad"&gt;&lt;div class="advSlotsWithoutGrayBox"&gt;&lt;div class="advHolder"&gt;&lt;p class="lhs"&gt;Story continues below Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="MC_ENG_PWA/MC_ENG_PWA_NEWS/MC_ENG_PWA_NEWS_AS/MC_ENG_PWA_ROS_NWS_AS_ATF_300" class="ads-div-detect id-MC_ENG_PWA/MC_ENG_PWA_NEWS/MC_ENG_PWA_NEWS_AS/MC_ENG_PWA_ROS_NWS_AS_ATF_300 MC_ENG_PWA_MC_ENG_PWA_NEWS_MC_ENG_PWA_NEWS_AS_MC_ENG_PWA_ROS_NWS_AS_ATF_300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some nutrients and herbs can interact with prescribed medications in potentially dangerous ways, such as nootropics and mood-stabilising psychiatric medications," Sandison clarified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lastPara"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.) Nootropics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a fancy word for a substance that supports cognitive function and typically includes a blend of vitamins, fats, amino acids, herbs, and sometimes caffeine. "My personal experience with nootropics is that they help with focus, mental clarity, mood and &lt;a rel="dofollow" href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/japanese-entrepreneur-40-sleeps-for-30-minutes-a-day-for-the-last-12-years-heres-why-12812582.html"&gt;better-quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;. It can give you a level up on days that you haven’t gotten enough rest or eaten well," Sandison told the publication. "I take them on days I’m giving talks or when I have a lot of work to get through and need to be on all day — they help me power through, feel productive and sleep better at night."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.) Vitamin D with K&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These fat-soluble vitamins have roles all over the body, particularly in maintaining bone health, but they are also directly related to &lt;a rel="dofollow" href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/brain-rot-is-oxford-university-s-word-of-the-year-2024-here-s-what-it-means-12881749.html"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;," the brain expert said. "Vitamin K works with D to direct calcium into the bones. Like vitamin D, having higher levels of circulating vitamin K is associated with better cognitive function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.) Omega-3 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="show-moblie mid-arti-ad"&gt;&lt;div class="advSlotsWithoutGrayBox"&gt;&lt;div class="advHolder"&gt;&lt;p class="lhs"&gt;Story continues below Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="MC_ENG_PWA/MC_ENG_PWA_NEWS/MC_ENG_PWA_NEWS_AS/MC_ENG_PWA_ROS_NWS_AS_BTF_300" class="ads-div-detect id-MC_ENG_PWA/MC_ENG_PWA_NEWS/MC_ENG_PWA_NEWS_AS/MC_ENG_PWA_ROS_NWS_AS_BTF_300 MC_ENG_PWA_MC_ENG_PWA_NEWS_MC_ENG_PWA_NEWS_AS_MC_ENG_PWA_ROS_NWS_AS_BTF_300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 essential fatty acids are anti-inflammatory and are believed to help reduce neuroinflammation and heart disease risk.

Proponents claim probiotics can boost your microbiome — the organisms that live inside your gut — and help with digestive issues, immune function and even mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UELL6DJ6OZBKTOBGXLTW6VOCBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the marketing claims about over-the-counter probiotics largely do not match the evidence.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;As a gastroenterologist, I rarely advise my patients to start a probiotic — much to their surprise. They’re even more surprised when I tell them that’s part of the evidence-based guidelines: The American Gastroenterological Association &lt;a href="https://gastro.org/news/aga-does-not-recommend-the-use-of-probiotics-for-most-digestive-conditions-2/" target="_blank"&gt;does not recommend&lt;/a&gt; probiotics for most digestive conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CXU2LDK6GRADVGCCGB3W3GOR44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Instead, here’s what I do recommend: Eat a fiber-rich diet. This time-tested recommendation remains one of the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4850918/" target="_blank"&gt;strongest-studied ways&lt;/a&gt; to promote and preserve a healthy microbiome and improve your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5Z24S2BKJBC6PIVTU3MSLEB3WE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Eating a low-fiber diet &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4850918/" target="_blank"&gt;leads to the loss&lt;/a&gt; of major categories of bacteria — and once certain groups are lost, they&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4850918/" target="_blank"&gt; can be lost for good&lt;/a&gt;, even if you try later to ramp up fiber intake later. So the time to act is now. The more &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4837298/" target="_blank"&gt;diverse your diet&lt;/a&gt;, the more diverse your microbiome, and the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23985870/" target="_blank"&gt;healthier&lt;/a&gt; you are. So choose a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/20/gut-health-microbiome-best-foods/" target="_blank"&gt;variety&lt;/a&gt; of high-fiber plants, nuts and fermented foods to feed your microbiome the nutrient buffet it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="QOOUCAO2VVDHFLZOGTLRMUBQXE" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="QOOUCAO2VVDHFLZOGTLRMUBQXE"&gt;Research on probiotics is all over the map&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2LQPBGSDABDZLB5XH5S3WBMA6Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Officially, the term “probiotic” is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrgastro.2014.66.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;defined&lt;/a&gt; as live microorganisms known to confer a health benefit. But of the more than 1,000 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32715136/" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; of probiotics, there is vast heterogeneity across experiments — different bacterial strains, different doses and different outcomes being measured. Some take characteristics of the host microbiome into account; others don’t, focusing more on symptoms or other health measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A375ZN2QXVAADPC7XAT5JWLSLU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This creates a confusing research landscape peppered with both positive and negative results. Even when &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.46872" target="_blank"&gt;aggregated into meta-analyses&lt;/a&gt;, the results are all over the map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CGGRBSRCHBDXVOT4VIKIGA26QY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration doesn’t consider over-the-counter probiotics to be drugs, so unlike medications,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;they don’t have to go through the process of rigorous testing and clinical trials.

Shortly afterward, the National Institutes of Health laid the groundwork for the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2792171/" target="_blank"&gt;Human Microbiome Project&lt;/a&gt;, a major &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06244" target="_blank"&gt;initiative&lt;/a&gt; to sequence and improve our understanding of the microbiome, from which many discoveries were made about diseases &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/09/28/parkinsons-disease-gut-brain-connection/" target="_blank"&gt;influenced by our gut bacteria.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZWDCQLW6S5HZTG6RBY35OPQO2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In theory, it would logically follow, altering the bacterial composition of the microbiome, possibly through the introduction of live microorganisms, could benefit our health.

And a 2021 study found that &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0258098" target="_blank"&gt;discussions of probiotics on X (formerly Twitter)&lt;/a&gt; were dominated by advertisements and promotions rather than by scientists or policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="F4TJPKLYXRFPJCQ25SZCATFWHA" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="F4TJPKLYXRFPJCQ25SZCATFWHA"&gt;Who should take probiotics?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7TI2HKPNVZEQXI3GUNZ4G3RB2M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are a few very specific scenarios where &lt;a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(20)34729-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;clinical guidelines&lt;/a&gt; support the use of probiotics in adults.

High cholesterol is a common issue many people grapple with. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It happens when there's an excess of cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol is a waxy fat produced by the liver and found in various &lt;a data-content-type="section" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/" rel="Follow" target="_blank"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While high cholesterol can affect many people occasionally, there are steps you can take to reduce it. One such step is altering your diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simple changes can make a significant difference to your health. Recently, a dietitian shared three straightforward ways to improve your lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ashley Reaver is committed to helping people lower their cholesterol and recently offered some invaluable tips in a TikTok video. Here's what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3&gt;Consider your meat consumption&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Ashley, dietary cholesterol "really doesn't have a big impact", but if you consume a lot of meat, that small impact can "add up". She emphasises the importance of evaluating all meat intake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Typically, those with high cholesterol levels are advised to limit their consumption of red and processed meat, choosing lean cuts instead. If you have high cholesterol or heart disease, it's suggested to restrict your red meat servings to one to two portions a week, or three ounces per week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opt for lean cuts like beef round, sirloin or tenderloin. Additionally, it's wise to trim all visible fat off the meat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Cut down on saturated fat consumption&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meat, which is known to contain saturated fat, can have a "big impact" on your cholesterol levels, according to the health expert. Saturated fats are the type that cause blood cholesterol to rise and are found in many different foods, especially animal products such as meat, butter and dairy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you're looking to lower your cholesterol, the American Heart Association suggests reducing saturated fat to less than 6% of total daily calories. To give you an idea, for someone consuming 2,000 calories a day, this equates to around 11 to 13 grams of saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Think about your carbs&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates play a crucial role in helping your body "rid" excess levels of cholesterol, says Ashley. However, it's important to note that not all carbohydrates are created equal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some types, like whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes, can help lower cholesterol. But the quality of the carbohydrates you consume matters, so it's advisable to seek medical advice before making dietary changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foods containing soluble fibre can help reduce the amount of cholesterol absorbed into the bloodstream. Examples of such foods include brown rice, quinoa and farro.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What you need to know about cholesterol&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;High cholesterol can be caused by various factors such as fatty food, lack of exercise, being overweight, smoking and drinking alcohol. It occurs when there's an excess of the fatty substance in your blood, and it can also be hereditary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given that there are typically no symptoms, a blood test is necessary for diagnosis. While healthy eating can help lower cholesterol, some people may require medication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's suggested to include more oily fish, olive oil, whole grains, nuts and seeds and fruits and vegetables in your diet. If you're aiming to lower your cholesterol levels, it's advised to reduce consumption of processed foods and meats, butter, cream, hard cheeses and cakes and biscuits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other beneficial steps include increasing physical activity, cutting down on alcohol and quitting smoking. If you have worries about your cholesterol levels, it's vital to consult your GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 09:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNYXktcWc3NXRzRmVuY1h6ZnRLOThiYUdyU0NWaVROYXBITUFKZ1NoWWFHSWRydTVLallMM01xNkJ0MnFoaV9ic0ZpUmhBNmgtdmttSi1DRXliTzBicG5wc05YaDFNS0hNZmJMWWg2a0RPWVV0QmJaOWZBU2dsRzM2MW55aE5Jb2hpeHhn</guid></item><item><title>Covid’s Long-Term Effects on the Lungs, Gut, Brain and More - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE9mV0VVUkE1dHI1UEQtRC1EMHBPUXFLb2FRc0F5Q0lMYjVnRGkxNGRSR2ZTS2xYYWRBZ1dTZXNpU0NBTEhNdE5JOTBRcVpuZ1VtOHhnTU9rZjZLZjl1V2I0bUZkaHFuVkM1bkJFc084RUx4ZEw3TVVmOHAyVGJ4eDg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Five years — and hundreds of millions of cases — after the World Health Organization declared the Covid-19 pandemic, scientists are getting a clearer picture of how the virus can affect the body long after an infection seems to pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some of Covid’s effects became apparent soon after the virus began spreading. We quickly understood how deadly an infection could be, especially for those with underlying conditions like diabetes and heart disease. But it has taken years of research to start making sense of how a bout of Covid can lead to lasting, sometimes invisible changes in different parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some of these effects, such as chronic fatigue and brain fog, are considered long Covid, defined as symptoms from an infection that persist for at least three months. By some estimates, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/health/long-covid-world.html" title=""&gt;400 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; have been diagnosed with some form of long Covid. But an infection can also lead to other issues, including lung and heart damage and microbiome changes in the gut, that may not always be recognized as long Covid but can still have a lasting effect on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;We now have a better sense of what might be behind those changes, including the role of the widespread inflammation that Covid can cause. For most people, inflammation will subside once the virus clears. But for some, if it “rages” too intensely or persists as a “slow burn” for too long, it can wreak havoc around the body, said Dr. Braden Kuo, a neurogastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here’s what scientists have learned so far about inflammation and the other factors driving these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-tosae5 eoo0vm40" id="link-300a4cd4"&gt;The Lungs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 09:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9mV0VVUkE1dHI1UEQtRC1EMHBPUXFLb2FRc0F5Q0lMYjVnRGkxNGRSR2ZTS2xYYWRBZ1dTZXNpU0NBTEhNdE5JOTBRcVpuZ1VtOHhnTU9rZjZLZjl1V2I0bUZkaHFuVkM1bkJFc084RUx4ZEw3TVVmOHAyVGJ4eDg</guid></item><item><title>For Patients Needing Transplants, Hope Arrives on Tiny Hooves - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNME0xMTM0TVViU3JnNmdhTnZDamhuOHpEeENabnFxUTAzM0NEQ2RJc1RVam9aVTlCeURmaU9ncmpMUnMxdkVNNmdtYk5zanY1aDNpRUc0TGFCQlNTQkRWYTFiUksxQmFjZkY2ZlRVdlFSVk43S3dBb2pGdnpLaVBpZVFDUkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;On a 300-acre farm in an undisclosed location in rural Wisconsin, surrounded by fields dotted with big red barns and bordered by wild blue chicory and goldenrod, live some of the most pampered pigs in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;They are delivered by C-section to protect them from viruses that sows can carry, and bottle-fed instead of nursed for the same reason.

But the initial rumblings in late 2019 about a mysterious respiratory illness circulating in China didn’t worry Osterholm too much at first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is likely to be a coronavirus, not an influenza virus,” he thought. “And if that’s the case, we already had experienced &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome" class="apm-link null" data-testid="externalLink"&gt;SARS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)" class="apm-link null" data-testid="externalLink"&gt;MERS&lt;/a&gt;.

Tim Walz on April 22, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="figure_credit"&gt;Glen Stubbe | AP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a few weeks into 2020, Osterholm’s first blush take on the COVID-19 virus changed. It was clear that this new virus was easily transmissible. His infectious disease research center put out a statement in late January 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was on its way. Get ready for it. Move. And I can remember … thinking, ‘My God, what’s coming down the pike,’” Osterholm recalls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_lingering_illness"&gt;Lingering illness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was coming down the pike were more than 7 million COVID related deaths worldwide. More than 16,000 were in Minnesota, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/stats/death.html" class="apm-link null" data-testid="externalLink"&gt;Minnesota Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there was a growing number of people who endured fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness and other neurological symptoms long after their initial COVID infection was over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually that group of people included Osterholm himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourteen months after the pandemic, Osterholm was fully vaccinated and he regularly wore a mask — except for a brief period with his friends on his birthday in 2021. Two days later he, a friend and his partner came down with COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure figure-none figure-full"&gt;&lt;picture class="" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://img.apmcdn.org/9fd702845df3b5a0704ead43c48794ebebfa1e12/uncropped/1f355f-20200521-covid-restaurant-reax-02.jpg 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/9fd702845df3b5a0704ead43c48794ebebfa1e12/uncropped/b921b0-20200521-covid-restaurant-reax-02.jpg 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/9fd702845df3b5a0704ead43c48794ebebfa1e12/uncropped/7fcf34-20200521-covid-restaurant-reax-02.jpg 1000w,https://img.apmcdn.org/9fd702845df3b5a0704ead43c48794ebebfa1e12/uncropped/b7c027-20200521-covid-restaurant-reax-02.jpg 1400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/9fd702845df3b5a0704ead43c48794ebebfa1e12/uncropped/d1b2c8-20200521-covid-restaurant-reax-02.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="notwebp"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.apmcdn.org/9fd702845df3b5a0704ead43c48794ebebfa1e12/uncropped/b921b0-20200521-covid-restaurant-reax-02.jpg" alt="Movable partitions divide tables in a restaurant.

Nguyen | MPR News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osterholm said he wasn’t severely ill but the effects lingered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t remember the names of things. We were here at home and I was asked a question about what I might like to drink,” he said. “I couldn’t remember the name of it, and I thought, ‘Oh, my God, I’m getting Alzheimer’s.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What lay ahead for Osterholm were months of extreme fatigue and brain fog. He says the mental anguish that came with those symptoms was the hardest part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had a job to do. We were in the middle of a pandemic. You don’t, as a fire chief, decide to quit putting out the fire because you might be tired that day,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Osterholm said his experience with COVID helped him better understand so many of the diseases he’s studied in his career that trigger an excessive immune system response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure figure-none figure-full"&gt;&lt;picture class="" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://img.apmcdn.org/e2878012eb25a150453286bd1f6a21249b3aee24/uncropped/10a225-20210119-covid-elementary-reopen-cn-001-400.jpg 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/e2878012eb25a150453286bd1f6a21249b3aee24/uncropped/1a1618-20210119-covid-elementary-reopen-cn-001-600.jpg 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/e2878012eb25a150453286bd1f6a21249b3aee24/uncropped/78f44c-20210119-covid-elementary-reopen-cn-001-1000.jpg 1000w,https://img.apmcdn.org/e2878012eb25a150453286bd1f6a21249b3aee24/uncropped/4c2dd4-20210119-covid-elementary-reopen-cn-001-1400.jpg 1400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/e2878012eb25a150453286bd1f6a21249b3aee24/uncropped/50b713-20210119-covid-elementary-reopen-cn-001-2000.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="notwebp"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.apmcdn.org/e2878012eb25a150453286bd1f6a21249b3aee24/uncropped/1a1618-20210119-covid-elementary-reopen-cn-001-600.jpg" alt="Kids wearing face masks sit at tables in a classroom.

Nguyen | MPR News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with so many people simultaneously experiencing long COVID, Osterholm said it’s pushed the medical field to better understand what can sometimes be written off as patients' imagined or ill-defined conditions.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully, this offers hope to [people with chronic immune diseases] too, that now there is a new effort being made to understand these immune system responses that are just out of whack,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_osterholm%E2%80%99s_new_concerns"&gt;Osterholm’s new concerns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic may be in the rearview mirror, but Osterholm said watching public health programs be dismantled under the Trump administration is even more emotionally challenging than navigating long COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He points to President Donald Trump’s attempts to eliminate USAID, which administers a global HIV program Osterholm helped create in the 2000s. &lt;a class="apm-link null" data-testid="relativeLink" href="/story/2025/02/28/rfk-jr-cancelled-flu-vaccine-meetings-what-does-that-mean-for-fall-shots"&gt;He’s also worried&lt;/a&gt; that a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meeting about the next flu vaccine was cancelled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" class="apm-link null" data-testid="externalLink"&gt;measles is spreading in nine Texas counties&lt;/a&gt; and Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who is Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services, has expressed skepticism about vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osterholm worries about how quickly the number of cases is growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a harbinger of things to come,” he said. “We have created an environment where routine immunization of children is no longer something that we can count on happening. This is not a prediction to scare people. It’s a prediction to say, ‘Look, it this is going to happen if we don’t do something different to better understand the importance of these vaccines.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_covid_missteps"&gt;COVID missteps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osterholm acknowledged that public health officials’ missteps during the COVID-19 pandemic eroded public trust in vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, the first COVID vaccines were highly effective. But Osterholm worried they would only offer short-term protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure figure-none figure-full"&gt;&lt;picture class="" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://img.apmcdn.org/09339eb0d6224a1cd60446f11f85b6608969b2bc/uncropped/fdcb72-20201215-covid-vaccine-white-earth-01.jpg 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/09339eb0d6224a1cd60446f11f85b6608969b2bc/uncropped/8bc50a-20201215-covid-vaccine-white-earth-01.jpg 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/09339eb0d6224a1cd60446f11f85b6608969b2bc/uncropped/a1564c-20201215-covid-vaccine-white-earth-01.jpg 1000w,https://img.apmcdn.org/09339eb0d6224a1cd60446f11f85b6608969b2bc/uncropped/10a2cf-20201215-covid-vaccine-white-earth-01.jpg 1400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/09339eb0d6224a1cd60446f11f85b6608969b2bc/uncropped/3239c9-20201215-covid-vaccine-white-earth-01.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="notwebp"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.apmcdn.org/09339eb0d6224a1cd60446f11f85b6608969b2bc/uncropped/8bc50a-20201215-covid-vaccine-white-earth-01.jpg" alt="A woman wearing a face mask receives a vaccine."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure_caption"&gt;&lt;p class="figure_text"&gt;Cmdr.

A booster is really important right now,’ think how different people would have perceived these vaccines,” he said. “Instead, they were made to get vaccines, they were told to get vaccines, that they would protect them and then they didn’t after months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, Osterholm said a more targeted approach to lockdowns might have been better received by the public. Instead of lengthy lockdowns geared at reining in highly contagious diseases, Osterholm advocates for short periods of isolation correlated to hospital capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure figure-none figure-full"&gt;&lt;picture class="" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://img.apmcdn.org/b16c3ef432694b6ef8b29abe6b45d14b14f81df1/uncropped/99b4c6-20200328-covid-stayathome-03.jpg 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/b16c3ef432694b6ef8b29abe6b45d14b14f81df1/uncropped/86b6d9-20200328-covid-stayathome-03.jpg 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/b16c3ef432694b6ef8b29abe6b45d14b14f81df1/uncropped/0524cb-20200328-covid-stayathome-03.jpg 1000w,https://img.apmcdn.org/b16c3ef432694b6ef8b29abe6b45d14b14f81df1/uncropped/7ff87d-20200328-covid-stayathome-03.jpg 1400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/b16c3ef432694b6ef8b29abe6b45d14b14f81df1/uncropped/ef8efe-20200328-covid-stayathome-03.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="notwebp"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.apmcdn.org/b16c3ef432694b6ef8b29abe6b45d14b14f81df1/uncropped/86b6d9-20200328-covid-stayathome-03.jpg" alt="A movie marquee reads &amp;quot;I assure you we're not open.&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure_caption"&gt;&lt;p class="figure_text"&gt;A pedestrian walks past a closed Uptown Theatre in Minneapolis on March 28, 2020.

&lt;p&gt;NCDC Director-General, Dr. Jide Idris, disclosed this in Abuja on Sunday, revealing that the patient was diagnosed in Ondo State but succumbed to the disease before test results confirmed the infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idris raised an alert on the situation, emphasising the need for heightened surveillance and precautionary measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He noted that the case underscores the persistent threat of Lassa fever in Nigeria and its potential for international transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the NCDC’s latest epidemiological report, Nigeria has recorded 2,728 suspected cases and 535 confirmed cases of Lassa fever in 2025, with 98 deaths reported across 14 states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The current case fatality rate stands at 18.3 per cent, indicating the severity of the disease,” Idris said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ondo, Bauchi, Edo, Taraba, and Ebonyi states account for 91 per cent of all confirmed cases, with the most affected local government areas including Owo, Akure South, Etsako West, Kirfi, Akoko South-West, Bali, Esan North-East, Bauchi, Toro, and Jalingo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the confirmed case involved a Nigerian physician who travelled to the UK on February 19, 2025, and returned on February 27, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He was admitted to a private health facility in Ondo State with symptoms consistent with Lassa fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Samples were collected on February 28, 2025, but the patient passed away on March 1, 2025, before test results were confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The NCDC later confirmed the diagnosis of Lassa fever on March 4, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investigations revealed that before his trip to the UK, the deceased had visited his fiancée in Edo State and interacted with family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a precautionary measure, contact tracing efforts have been launched in both Nigeria and the UK to prevent further spread of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the NCDC, in collaboration with the Ondo State Ministry of Health, has intensified contact tracing, surveillance, and infection control measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The agency is identifying and monitoring all potential contacts, including family members, healthcare workers, and fellow passengers on his flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Port Health Services are also enhancing surveillance at entry points, particularly airports, while collaboration with UK health authorities ensures cross-border tracking of potential exposures,” Idris said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idris reiterated public health guidelines to prevent further outbreaks, urging Nigerians to maintain proper hygiene, control rodent populations, and seek early medical attention for suspected cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He emphasised that Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease primarily transmitted through contact with food or household items contaminated by the urine, feces, or saliva of infected rodents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, “Human-to-human transmission can also occur, particularly in healthcare settings with inadequate infection prevention and control measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The NCDC continues to monitor disease patterns, deploy rapid response teams to affected areas, and support specialized treatment centers caring for severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Public awareness campaigns are ongoing, educating communities on rodent control, food safety, and the importance of early symptom reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite these efforts, Lassa fever remains a serious public health concern, with high mortality rates and the risk of international spread, as demonstrated by this recent case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;It is healthy to have regular, quality sex as a lack of it can be harmful to one’s health and may contribute to serious medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Jane Wairimu (not her real name), a woman in her mid 30s developed high blood pressure and back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1616524592174-0" class="ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;When she sought treatment, her doctor told her one of the reasons for these conditions at that age was a lack of regular and quality sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Additionally, a lack of regular sex has also been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer in men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Wairimu abstained from sexual activity for nearly eight years. She says her husband became impotent following the birth of their third child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“People experience periods of sexual inactivity or dry spells for various reasons, including busy schedules, being single or choosing to take a break, or adhering to religious teachings that  discourage pre-marital or &lt;a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/evewoman/between-the-sheets/article/2001237038/21-reasons-why-you-should-have-sex-and-the-advantages-to-our-health"&gt;extra marital affairs&lt;/a&gt;,” explains a gynaecologist and medical consultant based at Karen Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1616513706683-4" class="ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;While prolonged sexual abstinence is generally not associated with significant negative physical health effects, it can impact on emotional well being and intimacy within a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;”Anxiety, depression, and stress can arise from a lack of regular sex,”** says Dr. Joseph Odhiambo. Couples who do not engage in regular sex often feel less connected. Sex triggers the release of hormones like oxytocin and endorphins, which help manage stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Improved memory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Oxytocin also promotes better sleep. Research suggests that frequent sexual activity is linked to improved memory, and some studies indicate that sex may help the brain grow neurons and function more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Regular sex fosters emotional closeness between partners, improving communication. Studies show that couples who have sex more frequently tend to be happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;However, experts emphasize that daily intercourse is not necessary—once a week is often sufficient, as recommended by medical professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;After the age of 20, individuals should have sex at least twice a month to avoid complications associated with a lack of regular intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;According to Dr Odhiambo, a medic at Kenyatta University Teaching, Research, and Referral Hospital, sex can also boost the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;One study among college students found that those who had sex one to &lt;a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/features/article/2001504841/gen-z-boldly-redefine-casual-sex-and-safe-contraception-amidst-the-condom-dilemma"&gt;two times per week&lt;/a&gt; had higher levels of immunoglobulin, an antibody crucial for immune function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“If you are a woman experiencing menopause, regular intercourse is even more important,” explains Dr Odhiambo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“Without it, the vaginal tissues can become thinner, more fragile, and prone to tearing or bleeding during sex, which may lead to discomfort and avoidance—worsening the issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Menopausal changes, including vaginal dryness and irritation, can be treated with lubricants, moisturizers, or low-dose estrogen therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;It is widely believed that a lack of regular sex may contribute to prostate cancer. However, research on the topic is mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;While some experts suggest that frequent ejaculation might help reduce the risk, others argue that sexual activity could expose men to sexually transmitted infections that contribute to inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Pharmacist and molecular biologist Dr Steve Waluande states that men should ejaculate at least 21 times per month to reduce their risk of prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“Many prostate cancer patients I encounter admit to long periods without ejaculation, sometimes lasting months or even years,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Sexual dysfunction is any issue that prevents an individual or couple from experiencing satisfaction during sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Sexual dysfunction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Studies suggest that 45 per cent of women and 30 per cent of men experience some form of sexual dysfunction, which can occur at any stage of the sexual response cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Sexual dysfunction is generally classified into four categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Desire disorders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Lack of interest or reduced sexual desire. Arousal disorders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Difficulty becoming physically aroused. Orgasm disorders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Delay or inability to reach orgasm. Pain disorders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Discomfort or pain during intercourse. While sexual dysfunction can affect individuals of all ages, it is more prevalent in those over 40 due to age-related health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Common sexual health concerns for men:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Erectile dysfunction (inability to maintain an erection).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Delayed or absent ejaculation despite sufficient stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Premature ejaculation (inability to control the timing of ejaculation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;For women: Difficulty achieving orgasm. Insufficient vaginal lubrication. Vaginismus (involuntary tightening of vaginal muscles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;For both men and women: Low libido or lack of interest in sex. Difficulty with arousal. Pain during intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Dr Odhiambo explains that medical conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, hormonal imbalances, chronic illnesses (e.g., kidney or liver disease), alcoholism, and substance abuse can all impact sexual function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Additionally, certain medications, including some antidepressants, may contribute to sexual dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Social psychologist Tamara Ochieng’, formerly of Maseno University, highlights that psychological factors—such as stress, anxiety, body image concerns, past trauma, and relationship conflicts—can also play a significant role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Furthermore, some prescription and over-the-counter medications may reduce libido or interfere with sexual performance. The risk of sexual side effects is increased when an individual is taking several medications. Some over-the-counter antihistamines and decongestants can cause erectile dysfunction or problems with ejaculation, explains Dr Waluande. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                Elena (left) and Vadim live on the street in Kensington, a neighborhood of Philadelphia that has long struggled with fentanyl and other drug use.  Both told NPR they have survived their drug use, in part, due to naloxone, or Narcan, a medication that reverses opioid overdoses. NPR agreed not to use their last name because street drug use is illegal.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The deadliest phase of the street fentanyl crisis appears to have ended, as drug deaths continue to drop at an unprecedented pace. For the first time, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have now seen at least some recovery.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://opioiddatalab.ghost.io/peak-od-phenotypes/" target="_blank"&gt;A new analysis of U.S. overdose data&lt;/a&gt; conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill also found that the decline in deaths began much earlier than once understood, suggesting improvements may be sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"This is not a blip.  We are on track to return to levels of [fatal] overdose before fentanyl emerged," said Nabarun Dasgupta, lead researcher on the project, which examined overdose records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dasgupta's team found deaths linked to fentanyl and other street drugs have already plunged in many states to levels not seen since 2020.  That's when the spread of fentanyl and the COVID pandemic dealt a one-two punch, triggering a catastrophic surge of fatal overdoses. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"After all this time looking at overdose deaths, this is what we've been hoping for," Dasgupta said. "It has been a complete shock to see the numbers declining in the way they have been."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Overall drug deaths in the U.S. are down roughly a quarter, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm" target="_blank"&gt;provisional CDC data&lt;/a&gt;.  That includes fentanyl and other illicit drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Nora Volkow, head of the U.S. government's National Institute on Drug Abuse, said the decline in fatal overdoses linked to fentanyl is even greater.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"From fentanyl it's a 30.6% [drop in deaths] in one year. That's a huge reduction," Volkow said.  "It's very, very exciting to see."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Fewer deaths as drug users adapt and use Narcan &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Drug deaths in the U.S. have now dropped from a peak of 114,000 in 2023 to just under 87,000, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm" target="_blank"&gt;latest provisional data&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-52718" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                The Kensington neighborhood in Philadelphia.  City officials, nonprofit groups, churches and other organizations have attempted to reduce the amount of open street drug use, but most locals say progress has been slow.  While deaths are down, people struggling with addiction are visible on most streets.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia, where drug use has long been a widespread public health concern, many people told NPR they believe the situation has improved.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I can tell, you know, the numbers [of people dying] dropped a lot," said Elena, who regularly smokes fentanyl and xylazine, also known as tranq.  &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR agreed not to use the last names of people who were interviewed about their drug use because the activity is illegal under state and federal law.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"A lot more people started smoking instead of shooting [injecting&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fentanyl with needles] and I think that made a difference," Elena said.  While still highly risky, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38128362/" target="_blank"&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt; smoking fentanyl is considered safer than injecting. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Elena's partner, Vadim, who also smokes fentanyl laced with xylazine, said people facing severe addiction have adapted to fentanyl's incredible potency, often using smaller quantities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think people have adjusted.  When fentanyl first came out, people were used to shooting heroin. That's why they were dying. You need a lot less [fentanyl]," he said.   &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One other factor, they said, is naloxone, also known as Narcan, which is much more widely available now. The medication is used to reverse overdoses. Elena and Vadim said they had both been "narcaned" repeatedly by friends, which might have saved their lives.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Public health experts say these factors — along with more readily available addiction treatment and a decline in the potency of street fentanyl — likely contributed to the rapid decline in fatal overdoses here and around the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Statewide in Pennsylvania, drug deaths are down roughly a third from the peak.  At least 18 states have seen similar drops, with Arkansas (40% drop) and North Carolina (52.9% drop) achieving the biggest improvements.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's very, very exciting to see that it's dramatically decreasing," Volkow said.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Could the U.S. return to "normal" drug death levels not seen since fentanyl hit? &lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Volkow and Dasgupta said there's growing evidence this shift is long-term and sustainable, though they agreed it's still not clear why deaths are dropping so fast.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-23376" class="bucketwrap image medium"&gt;

                Nabarun Dasgupta, a researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is an expert on the U.S. street drug supply. He believes federal data shows a long-term drop in drug overdose deaths nationwide that signals a turning point in the fentanyl crisis.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Indeed, Dasgupta's more precise analysis of CDC records found many states actually saw overdose deaths begin dropping in 2021 and 2022, much earlier than previously reported. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a clear public health improvement no matter how you measure it.  It has been sustained in some states for years," Dasgupta said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dasgupta and Volkow also said that if the current trend holds, the U.S. could return to a level of fatal overdose not seen since&lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12260" target="_blank"&gt; 2016, when fentanyl began replacing heroin&lt;/a&gt; in the street drug supply.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It would be exciting if one could return to those values, because fentanyl just turned us upside down," Volkow said. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm" target="_blank"&gt;latest CDC provisional data&lt;/a&gt; did show five low-population Western states experiencing an uptick in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;drug deaths, including fentanyl, in 2024. The cumulative rise of roughly 260 fatal overdoses was&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;clustered mostly in Nevada.  But even those states are now below their peaks.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The result nationally is roughly 25,000 fewer deaths from fentanyl and other street drugs. &lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More survivors means &lt;/strong&gt;more need for health care and addiction treatment&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, Dasgupta — and other addiction experts interviewed by NPR — said this isn't a moment to declare victory. People surviving addiction to fentanyl and other toxic street drugs are often still profoundly unwell.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Christopher Moraff works for a nonprofit group in Pennsylvania called PA Groundhogs that tests street drug samples, monitoring for changes in the illegal supply sold by gangs and dealers. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-52721" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                A sign says "Narcan nasal spray here" in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia on Feb. 26. People living with addiction, medical doctors, harm reduction activists and others told NPR that the wide availability of Narcan, also called naloxone, has been a game changer. Annual fatal overdoses across Pennsylvania have dropped by more than 30% from the peak.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;According to Moraff, the latest samples show fentanyl potency dropping by as much as 50%, often replaced by powerful animal tranquilizers such as xylazine and medetomidine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Xylazine causes severe wounds on people but it requires a large amount of it to be fatal," he said, a sharp contrast with fentanyl, which can be deadly even in tiny doses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Ben Cocchiaro, a Philadelphia physician who treats patients experiencing addiction in the Kensington neighborhood, agreed that new drugs being sold on the street appear to kill fewer people, while still causing serious harm. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It does seem to be less lethal, but not less dangerous," Cocchiaro said.  "We're seeing plenty of problems that come from [these substances]. Xylazine has really bad skin wounds. Medetomidine has just a terrible withdrawal syndrome."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As more people avoid fatal overdoses, experts said there could actually be a rise in visible drug use in neighborhoods like Kensington, accompanied by a sharp increase in need for health care, housing, recovery treatment and other support.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"In some ways, counting bodies is easier than counting the amount of trauma and infections and other harms that people are experiencing from an unregulated drug supply," Dasgupta said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Back on the street, Elena and Vadim agreed that while fewer people are dying, the drugs they use often leave them dangerously ill.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I did end up with some tranq sores, some wounds," said Elena, referring to xylazine by its street name.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She was also infected with MRSA, a medication-resistant strain of bacteria that spreads on contaminated street drug gear. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was hospitalized for that. It was pretty bad," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-52720" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                "I have hope," Elena said. "I have to, you know?" Vadim (left) and Elena told NPR they have lived for periods of time in recovery, not using fentanyl or other street drugs, before relapsing. Addiction experts say the drop in fatal overdose deaths gives people more time and more opportunity to heal.

   &lt;p&gt;Still, experts said the fact that tens of thousands of people like Vadim and Elena are still alive nationwide represents major progress.  &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/15/1071282194/addiction-substance-recovery-treatment" target="_blank"&gt;Addiction research shows&lt;/a&gt; people who use drugs often achieve long-term recovery, if they can avoid fatal overdoses.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Recovery is possible, it's how much you want it," Vadim said. "We've both had clean time [between drug-use relapses] so you know, it's possible."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I have hope," Elena said. "I have to, you know?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balance might not be something you've thought about much, but as you get older, changes in muscle strength and coordination can affect stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that a simple daily balance exercise—one you can do while the kettle boils—can help you stay steady on your feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Balance is a big predictor of good health and longevity," says Abby McLachlan, Pilates instructor and founder of wellness studio &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eastofeden.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.eastofeden.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;East of Eden&lt;/a&gt;. "There's lots of opportunities to include balance challenges within your Pilates practice, whether you're on a reformer or at home on a mat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacLachlan suggests doing this quick Pilates-inspired exercise at home—it only takes two minutes and doesn't require any equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-two-minute-balance-challenge"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the two-minute balance challenge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won’t need any equipment for this exercise. However, it’s a good idea to stand near a stable surface—like a wall or table—just in case you need support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The balance challenge is basically a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/squats" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/squats"&gt;squat&lt;/a&gt; variation. Here's how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start with your feet slightly wider than hip-width apart, toes turned out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower into a squat, keeping your weight in your heels, getting your hips as low as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As you push back up, rise up onto the toes of your right foot. Hold for a second then lower back down into the squat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat on your left toes, then return to the squat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally, rise up onto both tiptoes before lowering back down into the squat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat for one or two minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-benefits-of-pilates-for-balance"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The benefits of Pilates for balance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sequence might look simple, but it’s a powerful way to improve balance, stability and core engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-DcN7pp5RXFuTtxUWL2D5Zf" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-DcN7pp5RXFuTtxUWL2D5Zf slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;McLachlan explains that switching on the core is key for good balance in Pilates. "You need to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core"&gt;engage your core&lt;/a&gt; to move with control and precision," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her advice? "Imagine you've got a corset around your ribs, and as you exhale, the corset tightens [bringing the ribs together]. Do that before you move into the squat, exhale on the downward move, then inhale to come up and perform the balance challenge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pilates is all about moving slowly with control. Not only does this increase muscle engagement but it trains your body to balance more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give this challenge a go and try adding it to your daily routine to see how your stability improves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="story_dl"&gt;March 10 (UPI) --&lt;/span&gt; Health officials in Maryland have confirmed the state's first measles case for the year amid expanding outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maryland Department of Health said in &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/One-Case-of-Measles-Confirmed-in-Maryland.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; Sunday that a Howard County resident with recent international travel history has tested positive for the highly contagious disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is warning anyone who visited Terminal A of Washington Dulles International Airport between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Wednesday and &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Johns_Hopkins/" target="_blank" title="Johns Hopkins" class="tpstyle"&gt;Johns Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; Howard County Medical Center Pediatric Emergency Department between 3:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. on Friday that they may have been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Out of an abundance of caution, health officials are coordinating an effort to identify people who might have been exposed, including contacting potentially exposed passengers on specific flights," the department said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identity of the patient as well as the country they had visited was not revealed to the public. The vaccination status of the patient was also withheld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials stated that the case is not connected to an outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico were the disease has killed at least two people and sicked around 230 others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 198 cases have been reported in West Texas, state health officials &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. Meanwhile, New Mexico health officials on Friday &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/vaccine/2025/3/?view=2190" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; they have confirmed 30 cases, up from 10 &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2025/03/06/new-mexico-death-measles/1641741311081/" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a day prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including Maryland, New Mexico and Texas, measles has been confirmed this year in at least 13 jurisdictions. Cases have also been confirmed in Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York City, Pennsylvania, &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Rhode_Island/" target="_blank" title="Rhode Island" class="tpstyle"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; and Washington, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles remains rare in New Mexico, where one case was reported in each of the last two years following zero cases confirmed from 2020 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease was officially eliminated from the United States in 2000. A few cases have been detected in the following years among those with contacts abroad. The new outbreaks are associated with those who are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, a total of 285 cases reported in 33 jurisdictions, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;

Late last month an unvaccinated child died in Texas in a separate measles outbreak. The deaths come as the U.S. public health programs and agencies are rocked by the appointment of &lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/tag/rfk-jr" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Robert F. Kennedy Jr.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known vaccine skeptic, as the new secretary of health and human services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It also comes at the five-year anniversary of the beginning of the COVID pandemic. Dr. Mike Osterholm, one of the country’s top health experts, spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Advocate &lt;/em&gt;recently about the anniversary and his concerns about U.S. public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;During the height of the pandemic, then-&lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/joe-biden" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:President Joe Biden;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;President Joe Biden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appointed Osterholm to his &lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/health/2020/7/03/how-80s-era-hiv-contact-tracing-can-help-kill-covid" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:COVID advisory committee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;COVID advisory committee&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because of his expertise in pandemic preparedness, disease outbreak investigations, and public health practice. Osterholm is Regents Professor, McKnight Presidential Endowed Chair in Public Health and the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota, where he's taught for almost 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Osterholm has been vocal about the potential negative impacts of Kennedy’s appointment on both national and global health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“One of the immediate actions taken under Secretary Kennedy's leadership was the suspension of critical vaccine advisory meetings,” Osterholm said. “The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is responsible for recommending vaccine protocols, and a similar committee advising the Food and Drug Administration on flu vaccines, have both had their sessions canceled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Osterholm expressed deep concern over these cancellations. "I don't see any reason why we would need to have a total pause in the sharing of information," he pointed out. “Such disruptions could jeopardize the ability of agencies like the CDC and FDA to respond to emerging public health crises.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He also pointed to the &lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/tag/cdc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC's;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC's&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; delayed response to the measles outbreak in &lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/texas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Texas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Texas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, attributing it to the necessity of clearing communications through the &lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/tag/department-of-health-and-human-services" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Department of Health and Human Services;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Effective public health relies heavily on good communication; without it, challenges become more pronounced, as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic,” he explained. “Effective communication enhances the likelihood of successfully addressing public health emergencies and bringing them to a resolution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The importance of maintaining robust communication as well as vaccination programs is being underscored by the measles outbreaks. In Texas, that outbreak has resulted in over 130 cases. The death in the state is the first U.S. measles fatality in about a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;During a recent Cabinet meeting, Kennedy downplayed the severity of the outbreak, suggesting that measles occurrences are routine and misstating hospitalization protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“What he said was not true,” Osterholm said. “He had a number of misstatements...He also said that the children that were hospitalized were being quarantined. Quarantine is something we use to basically take people who might be infectious and capable of transmitting and in a sense isolating them from doing that. That is not true. These children are all hospitalized because they're severely ill.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the last week, Kennedy, who first seemed to tout fish oil instead of vaccines, has taken to Fox News to recommend the measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On top of all this, Osterholm characterized the administration's approach to governing as being led by a "wildly swinging machete" rather than a "finely precisioned surgical tool," suggesting that necessary changes should be implemented thoughtfully and strategically. “While it's essential to assess workforce productivity and make necessary adjustments, such actions should be executed with precision, akin to using a surgical instrument, rather than through broad and hasty measures, because some of our finest doctors and researchers as well as grants might be part of that machete cut.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He further criticized the abrupt withdrawal of support for numerous global health programs aimed at combating diseases and promoting healthy lives for children. “I compare it to suddenly denying a patient a lifesaving drug without warning because these moves by the administration will have immediate and severe consequences,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He predicted that these decisions could lead to a crisis, especially with anticipated major cuts to federal health agencies like the CDC, &lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/tag/food-and-drug-administration-fda" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:FDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;FDA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/tag/nih" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Addressing the potential cuts in funding for programs targeting diseases like &lt;a href="https://www.advocate.com/hiv" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:AIDS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;AIDS &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;and malaria, Osterholm asserted that these diseases "don't know borders, but they love chaos." He explained that reduced attention and resources can enhance the transmission of these diseases, leading to a "double whammy" where the elimination of international borders for transmission is compounded by increased spread due to diverted focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The damage inflicted by such neglect may be immediate but will have long-term implications, making recovery challenging,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Regarding the bird flu problem, Osterholm emphasized that it requires a long-term solution, particularly the development of reliable, durable, and safe vaccines. He criticized the current minimal investment in vaccine research and development for both flu and coronaviruses. “It’s a major mistake that will incur a significant price in the future,” he said. “Having more effective vaccines readily available and ensuring public willingness to receive them are crucial steps in mitigating the impact of future pandemics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The convergence of leadership that undermines vaccine efficacy, coupled with policies that disrupt both domestic and global health initiatives, presents a precarious future for public health, setting up a perfect storm, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Everything that I could define as a disrupter is what's happening in terms of public health in this country,” he cautioned. “The proof is in the pudding of what's happening right now. When people used to ask me how concerned I was about public health, I always said I sleep with one eye open, and lately I feel like I've been sleeping with three eyes open."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 06:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5QWmxoTExXbG1qM2s1ekk0T1B0dTA4MG9xR2ZBcUMxRXp4STBlYkNkTFM4eHBISGx0U0tadzBoOXZRSGZBb3dlb1NsWEkyWTd2bVBrVlZNbmkxYS1XNTNNeExqYm5iOVhaN0FydDR2bDNaR19CQXBzSmxPSQ</guid></item><item><title>Outrage over 'chickenpox party' plan at Gainsborough play centre - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBnWWtFQWtfRkdrZEFGYW9YSnhYYnprZXEyVzREcHFFdEc5ZW9vcDZldnVKdDE5ZHk3NVlCeUd2TkJMcWtuVHo3TmV1UkZ2em1GUFVjODV4MGVrZ9IBX0FVX3lxTFB0S1JER2YwUnlnWW9ZYTF3d1F4dlIwQmhzX1BENTFuU3RwZFNnbGVUZDZNSlZaaUxrSm55cEQ4MkJkWmtDTTlZekpyU3dnWnBZZzlUaVZzUm9tSzNJdXk0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Outrage over play centre 'chickenpox party' plan&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-b42e7a8f-0 haItSe"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-b42e7a8f-12 fcCDwR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-b42e7a8f-5 evAEAB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-b42e7a8f-7 kItaYD"&gt;Sarah-May Buccieri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-8 cRnJZw"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-b42e7a8f-11 cUqPzF"&gt;Reporting from&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 32 32" category="personalisation" icon="location" class="sc-735e4804-0 cCvcou"&gt;&lt;path d="M12.3 11c0 2.1 1.7 3.7 3.7 3.7s3.7-1.7 3.7-3.7-1.6-3.7-3.7-3.7S12.3 9 12.3 11zm2.9 20c-3-4.4-5.6-8.5-7.3-12.1-1.5-3-2.1-5.6-2.1-7.9C5.7 5.5 10.1 1 16 1s10.3 4.6 10.3 10c0 2.3-.7 4.9-2.1 7.9-1.7 3.6-4.3 7.7-7.3 12.1h-1.7z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Gainsborough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d5ad/live/46b53a00-fa7e-11ef-af57-25ff1b13d909.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d5ad/live/46b53a00-fa7e-11ef-af57-25ff1b13d909.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d5ad/live/46b53a00-fa7e-11ef-af57-25ff1b13d909.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d5ad/live/46b53a00-fa7e-11ef-af57-25ff1b13d909.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d5ad/live/46b53a00-fa7e-11ef-af57-25ff1b13d909.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d5ad/live/46b53a00-fa7e-11ef-af57-25ff1b13d909.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d5ad/live/46b53a00-fa7e-11ef-af57-25ff1b13d909.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d5ad/live/46b53a00-fa7e-11ef-af57-25ff1b13d909.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Jane Coulson is wearing a red jacket with a blue shirt underneath.

			&lt;p&gt;The 'silent' X chromosome within female brains may not be so silent after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study has found evidence in both mice and humans that as we age, 'sleeping' X chromosomes can be 'awakened' in brain cells critical to learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overlooked influence of this genetic library could be a key reason why &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/it-s-not-just-humans-females-outlive-males-in-other-mammals-too"&gt;females live longer than males&lt;/a&gt; and exhibit slower cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In typical aging, women have a brain that looks younger, with fewer cognitive deficits compared to men," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/03/429571/silent-x-chromosome-gives-aging-female-brain-boost"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Dena Dubal from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results show that the silent X in females actually reawakens late in life, probably helping to slow cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154260" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154260" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-642x406.jpg" alt="Brain Cells Hippocampus" class="size-medium wp-image-154260" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-642x406.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-657x415.jpg 657w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-768x485.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-600x379.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154260" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Oligodendrocytes (green), in the hippocampus of the mouse brain. These cells often deteriorate during aging. (Gadek et al., &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The X chromosome harbors about 5 percent of the human genome, and it is largely understudied in the aging brain, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads8169"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; Dubal and her co-authors from UCSF, led by neurologist Margaret Gadek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Female mammals possess two X chromosomes - one from each parent – but in each cell of the body, a random one of those chromosomes is silenced and the other is activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some select genes from the X chromosome, however, can escape inactivation, and evidence suggests that as we grow older, more X chromosomes are not held down by genetic 'gag orders'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that the expression of both X chromosomes could potentially drive the different ways that male and female brains age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test that idea, researchers investigated brain cells in the female hippocampus, which is a brain region strongly involved in learning, memory, and emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the team studied mice with X chromosomes from two different rodent 'strains', &lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;M. castaneus. &lt;/i&gt;In their models, the X chromosome in &lt;i&gt;M. musculus&lt;/i&gt; is missing an important gene, called Xist, which means it cannot be silenced like usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means in some of their offspring the &lt;i&gt;M. castaneus&lt;/i&gt; X chromosome is always the one getting deactivated, so if its genetic effects show up in brain cells, then it is considered an "escapee".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154262" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-642x587.png" alt="Mouse X Chromosomes" class="size-medium wp-image-154262" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-642x587.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-454x415.png 454w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-768x702.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-600x548.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX.png 952w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154262" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;M. musculus&lt;/em&gt; XX mice with an Xist deletion were crossed with XY &lt;em&gt;M. castaneus&lt;/em&gt; mice. XX progeny without an Xist deletion (left) underwent random X chromosome inactivation. XX progeny with an Xist deletion (right) harbor an active X chromosome strictly from the &lt;em&gt;M. musculus&lt;/em&gt; strain and an inactive X chromosome from the &lt;em&gt;M. castaneus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using RNA sequencing, researchers looked at the nuclei of 40,000 hippocampal cells in four young and four old female mice to figure out which X chromosome is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readings that rose from the X were 91.7 percent &lt;em&gt;M. musculus&lt;/em&gt; and 8.3 percent&lt;em&gt; M. castaneus&lt;/em&gt;. Because the &lt;em&gt;M. castaneus&lt;/em&gt; X chromosome was supposed to be silenced, this suggests between 3 and 7 percent of its genes somehow escaped inactivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was true of most cell types in the mouse hippocampus, and more so in older brains. The cells most likely to express genes of the inactive X include &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentate_gyrus"&gt;dentate gyrus&lt;/a&gt; neurons, which play a critical role in memory, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-alzheimers-finding-brains-support-cells-may-be-fueling-disease"&gt;oligodendrocytes&lt;/a&gt;, which support the formation of neural connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see if these findings extend to human brains, researchers at UCSF looked through previously published data on inactive X genes that change with age in at least one or more types of brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around half of the aging-induced targets identified on the inactivated X chromosome caused human intellectual disability if mutated. This suggests that the inactivated X chromosome carries genes enriched for cognition-related factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these genes, called &lt;em&gt;PLP1&lt;/em&gt;, particularly increases its expression with age in the neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes of the dentate gyrus. The &lt;em&gt;PLP1 &lt;/em&gt;gene expresses &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_proteolipid_protein"&gt;a protein involved in the formation of myelin sheaths&lt;/a&gt; that surround neurons and allow them to send messages more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In parallel to mice, older women showed increased &lt;em&gt;PLP1&lt;/em&gt; expression in the parahippocampus, compared to older men," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ads8169"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154428" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154428" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square-642x642.jpg" alt="Female Sex Chromosomes May Explain Why Some Brains Age Slower" class="size-medium wp-image-154428" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square-642x642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154428" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Oligodendrocytes in the mouse brain are shown in yellow. When expressed in oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus, &lt;em&gt;PLP1&lt;/em&gt; improved cognition in aging mice. (Gadek et al., &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing the expression of the &lt;em&gt;PLP1&lt;/em&gt; gene in male and female mice improved cognition in the aging brain, enhancing learning and memory in the animal models. This could be a possible target for future treatments of brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The study of female-specific biology is historically underrepresented in science and medicine but is essential and expanding fervently," the team &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ads8169"&gt;concludes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JPD-191683"&gt;twice as high&lt;/a&gt; in men as in women, and new research points to a potential reason why: a normally benign protein in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) protein is not normally a threat, and is important in regulating cellular energy use in the brain. However, the new research shows that in some  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="153473" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; cases, the immune system mistakes PINK1 for an enemy, attacking brain cells that express the protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study, led by a team from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California, the PINK1-related damage done by the immune system's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"&gt;T cells&lt;/a&gt; is much more widespread and aggressive in the brains of men than women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153476" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153476" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/ParkinsonsGraphic.jpg" alt="Parkinsons graphic" class="wp-image-153476 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/ParkinsonsGraphic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/ParkinsonsGraphic-600x287.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153476" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers studied multiple proteins related to Parkinson's disease. (Williams et al., &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sex-based differences in T cell responses were very, very striking," &lt;a href="https://www.lji.org/news-events/news/post/immune-cells-may-lead-to-more-parkinsons-cases-in-men/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; immunologist Alessandro Sette, from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. "This immune response may be a component of why we see a sex difference in Parkinson's disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using blood samples from Parkinson's patients, the researchers tested the response of the T cells in the blood against a variety of proteins &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10113022"&gt;previously linked&lt;/a&gt; to Parkinson's – finding that PINK1 stood out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the male Parkinson's patients, the research team noticed a six-fold increase in T cells targeting PINK1-tagged brain cells, compared with healthy brains. In the female Parkinson's patients, there was only a 0.7-fold increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the same researchers had &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15626-w"&gt;previously found&lt;/a&gt; something similar happening with T cells and the alpha-synuclein protein. However, these reactions weren't common to all Parkinson's brains, which prompted the hunt for more antigens – substances that trigger immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is always the case with research of this type, once experts know more about how a disease gets started and how it progresses, that opens up new opportunities for finding ways to put a halt to the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We could potentially develop therapies to block these T cells, now that we know why the cells are targeting in the brain," &lt;a href="https://www.lji.org/news-events/news/post/immune-cells-may-lead-to-more-parkinsons-cases-in-men/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; immunologist Cecilia Lindestam Arlehamn, from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further down the line, being able to spot these PINK1-sensitive T cells in blood samples could lead to Parkinson's disease &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-discovery-means-parkinsons-could-be-diagnosed-with-a-swab-in-just-3-minutes"&gt;being diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; at an earlier stage – which again helps with treatment and patient support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we're still waiting to discover a cure for Parkinson's disease, constant progress is being made in understanding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-link-to-gut-bacteria-suggests-an-unexpected-simple-treatment"&gt;the risk factors involved&lt;/a&gt; in its development, and new approaches &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-could-already-have-an-fda-approved-treatment"&gt;to tackling it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We need to expand to perform more global analysis of the disease progression and sex differences – considering all the different antigens, disease severities, and time since disease onset," &lt;a href="https://www.lji.org/news-events/news/post/immune-cells-may-lead-to-more-parkinsons-cases-in-men/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI180478"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Maryland resident with recent international travel has confirmed to be infected with a case of measles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Maryland Department of Health and Howard County health officials &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/One-Case-of-Measles-Confirmed-in-Maryland.aspx"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Sunday that a person who recently traveled internationally was confirmed to be infected.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The case was not associated with the current measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Out of an abundance of caution, health officials are coordinating an effort to identify people who might have been exposed, including contracting potentially exposed passengers on specific flights,” the officials said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The department said anyone who was at Washington Dulles International Airport in Terminal A, on transportation to the main terminal and in the baggage claim area, on March 5 from 4 to 9 p.m. could have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People could have been exposed if they also were at Johns Hopkins Howard County Medical Center Pediatric Emergency Department from March 7 at 3:30 to 7:30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms include a fever higher than 101 degrees, a runny nose, cough and red, watery eyes. A person will experience a red rash one to four days after early symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A large outbreak in West Texas has &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5181254-second-measles-death-reported-as-outbreak-grows-in-southwest/"&gt;killed two people&lt;/a&gt;, making them the first U.S. measles deaths in a decade. State health officials in Texas say the &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5171861-measles-outbreak-continues-spike/"&gt;hundreds of thousands&lt;/a&gt; of people in the San Antonio area could have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly transmissible virus, as one infected person can infect 9 out of 10 people they come in contact with.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;An outbreak of tuberculosis, or TB – a lung disease that is often accompanied by a hacking cough – began in January 2024 in Kansas City, Kansas, and two nearby counties and &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2242/Tuberculosis-Outbreaks"&gt;continues as of early March 2025&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, 147 people have been reportedly diagnosed with TB in the outbreak, with 67 becoming ill. The remaining 80 people diagnosed with TB in Kansas contracted the illness but showed no symptoms, which is called a latent infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TB is the leading infectious cause of death around the world, outpaced only by &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;COVID-19 during the first three years of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q0nZ6HV5VA8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Conversation asked microbiologists &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zEgCkh0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Karen Dobos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ZdujPQAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Marcela Henao-Tamayo&lt;/a&gt;, both from Colorado State University, to explain why this ancient disease seems to be making a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's the history of TB?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; is the organism that causes the disease &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/index.html"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; in humans. The disease has been infecting humans for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found evidence of the disease &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003426"&gt;9,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt; in the excavated remains of people who lived in the Eastern Mediterranean region during that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of TB date back to around 410-400 B.C.E., when the physician Hippocrates termed the disease phthisis, an archaic word that means a progressive "wasting away," due to the way &lt;a href="https://jmvh.org/article/history-of-tuberculosis-part-1-phthisis-consumption-and-the-white-plague/"&gt;people with the disease become emaciated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TB was also known as consumption for the same reason. Similarly, it was called the white plague or white death – due to anemia from the disease, with people appearing pallid or chalky – leading to near-certain death. Untreated active TB, meaning cases that are symptomatic, is highly lethal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wA_fObLY6GE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of all people with untreated active TB &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2022/tb-disease-burden/2-2-tb-mortality"&gt;die from the disease&lt;/a&gt;, whereas treatment &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/tb-diagnosis-and-treatment/2-3-tb-treatment--coverage-and-outcomes#"&gt;reduces the death rate to 12%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more colorful phrases describing TB is "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.318.7199.1705"&gt;the king's evil&lt;/a&gt;." This is a form of TB that also causes neck swelling and lesions, a condition called scrofula. During the Middle Ages, people believed that the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/3/AC-2803_article"&gt;touch of a king&lt;/a&gt; could cure a person from this form of TB through miraculous intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, TB was most ominously called the "robber of youth" due to its historical propensity to &lt;a href="https://doi-ds.org/doilink/11.2021-59178487/JMVH%20Vol%2022%20No%202"&gt;afflict people 15 to 30 years old&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1865, Jean Antoine Villemin, an army physician in Paris, demonstrated that TB could be transmitted from infected animals to healthy ones through inoculation. Before these studies, the cause of TB was &lt;a href="https://jmvh.org/article/history-of-tuberculosis-part-1-phthisis-consumption-and-the-white-plague/"&gt;presumed to be primarily constitutional&lt;/a&gt;, by either an inherent predisposition or from unhealthy or immoral lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microorganism causing TB was ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000222.htm#"&gt;discovered in 1882&lt;/a&gt; by the German physician Robert Koch. Koch announced his findings on March 24, 1882, a day globally recognized as &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-tb-day"&gt;World TB Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does TB spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis is spread by small infectious droplets in the air. A TB patient may emit these droplets by coughing, singing and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202110-2378OC"&gt;potentially from regular breathing that occurs during sleep or resting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One form of TB can be spread through &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.02.091"&gt;unpasteurized dairy products&lt;/a&gt;. While rare, there have been reports of TB &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/pdfs/mm725253-H.pdf"&gt;transmission through bone graphs&lt;/a&gt;, in which healthy, donated bone material is used to replace damaged bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of the TB outbreak in Kansas remains unknown as of early March 2025. The outbreak has disproportionately affected those in low-income communities, and two people have died from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, a patient with untreated TB &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;can infect 10 to 15 others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Could the COVID-19 pandemic be a factor?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="154446" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="154446" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; has played a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2022/covid-19-and-tb?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;pivotal role in the resurgence of TB&lt;/a&gt;. Cases &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/global-tb-report-2024_factsheet.pdf?"&gt;increased globally by 4.6% from 2020 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;, reversing decades of steady declines in the disease. In the U.S. alone, TB cases rose by &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-surveillance-report-2023/summary/index.html"&gt;more than 15% from 2022 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During mandatory shutdowns, people were &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp2118145"&gt;less able to access health care centers&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2022.891711"&gt;early diagnosis of TB&lt;/a&gt; or to fill prescriptions for treatment, perhaps due to the fear of contracting COVID-19 while visiting a medical care facility. COVID-19-related disruptions in care &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024"&gt;resulted in nearly 700,000 excess deaths from TB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to health care may not be the only factor behind this uptick. Medical supply shortages and delays in shipment may have also played a role. For example, the U.S. experienced &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/php/dear-colleague-letters/2023-tb-drug-shortages.html"&gt;shortages of one of the primary TB drugs&lt;/a&gt; between 2021 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the main treatments?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multidrug treatment is currently the only way to cure TB and stop its spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the late 1930s, when the first antibiotic for TB treatment was developed, TB treatments included bloodletting and consumption of cod liver oil. The most popular treatment involved isolated sanatoriums in high-altitude areas such as the Adirondacks and the Rocky Mountains, where the cold, dry air was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/4574446"&gt;believed to be a cure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars at the time suggested that the potential for cure was due to these environments being more &lt;a href="https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;amp;httpsredir=1&amp;amp;article=1017&amp;amp;context=unm_bulletin"&gt;invigorating for the body and providing more restful sleep&lt;/a&gt;. There is no evidence to support these beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streptomycin was the first antibiotic treatment to become available for TB, in the 1940s. However, the microorganism quickly became drug resistant. A second antibiotic, called isoniazid, was developed as a first-line treatment &lt;a href="https://doi-ds.org/doilink/11.2021-98726273/JMVH"&gt;against TB in the 1950s&lt;/a&gt;. Again, the microorganism became drug resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two- and four-drug combinations are now used to treat both latent infections and active disease. Treatment of active TB requires at least six months of uninterrupted therapy. Disruptions in treatment result in further spread of TB and the emergence of multidrug resistant TB, which requires additional drugs and more than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/tb-diagnosis-and-treatment"&gt;nine months of treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All TB drugs are toxic; the quality of life for TB patients &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5588/ijtld.22.0514"&gt;deteriorates during treatment&lt;/a&gt; and remains so throughout their lives. Finding cases and treating TB illness early, before symptoms begin, is important because it not only reduces the spread of disease but also greatly reduces drug toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What should people be aware of?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People should be aware that TB is still a public health problem across the globe. Education on the transmission, treatment and need for active work to eradicate TB is the best defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why education and awareness about TB are so important is that a person with latent TB may be unknowingly harboring the microorganism for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of symptoms, these people are unlikely to seek care and will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00028-6"&gt;not be diagnosed and treated&lt;/a&gt; unless identified as part of an outbreak, as was the case for more than half of the patients in Kansas.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/249450/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

These stem cells, known as type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s), play a key role in repairing &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-study-reveals-why-most-life-long-smokers-never-develop-lung-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lung tissue&lt;/a&gt;. Without sufficient zinc, their ability to regenerate is impaired, leading to worsening fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tracing the molecular pathway responsible for this dysfunction, the team identified a potential method to restore lung healing. Their findings suggest that targeting this pathway could lead to treatments capable of reversing lung damage rather than just slowing disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further explore this, the researchers developed a laboratory model of IPF using mice. This model allows them to test potential therapies in a controlled environment, providing a crucial step toward developing new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also studied &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/cutting-edge-ai-platform-significantly-improves-lung-cancer-diagnosis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lung organoids&lt;/a&gt;—miniature, simplified versions of organs grown from patient tissues. They found that cells missing the ZIP8 protein, which helps transport zinc into the cell, failed to regenerate and form colonies as healthy cells should. This highlighted ZIP8’s essential role in lung repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The organoids with AEC2 cells that had the ZIP8 transporter were able to draw zinc into the cells, and then were able to regenerate and form more colonies,” said Carol Liang, MD, MBA, associate professor of Medicine and first author of the study. “The cells without ZIP8 didn’t have a way to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/zinc-can-improve-crop-yields-and-climate-resilience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;draw zinc in&lt;/a&gt;, so they formed fewer colonies. This is how we determined that it is ZIP8 that allows the cells to use zinc.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators also used medication and deletion of the ZIP8 gene in mouse AEC2s to mimic IPF in laboratory mice. When they fed these mice a diet that included zinc supplements, their fibrosis improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been few detailed studies of how &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-reveal-significant-link-between-zinc-levels-and-type-2-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;zinc works in the lungs&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dianhua Jiang, MD, PhD, professor of Medicine at Cedars-Sinai and co-senior author of the study. “Ours is the first to identify the detailed function of zinc in lung biology, specifically in IPF. It was particularly exciting to discover that zinc regulates the production of two other key molecules that promote tissue regeneration, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and Sirtuin1. These molecules have been implicated in tissue regeneration and aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Role of zinc dysregulation in lung disease.

Despite the best efforts of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/could-wearable-devices-adversely-affect-your-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthcare providers&lt;/a&gt;, IPF remains a major public health concern, affecting more people each year as the population ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings offer hope for patients and their families who have been impacted by this devastating condition. While there is still much research to be done to understand the mechanisms behind the loss of ZIP8 and how zinc supplements can help &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/e-cigarette-use-increases-risk-for-asthma-by-252-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reverse lung damage&lt;/a&gt;, the discovery of this molecular pathway is a significant step forward in the fight against IPF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study has the potential to provide much-needed relief for patients suffering from IPF,” said Liang. “We hope to continue our research and ultimately develop a safe and effective treatment for this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;UMAP plots of flow-enriched EpCAM+CD31–CD45– cells from healthy (11,381 cells, n = 6) and IPF lungs (14,687 cells, n = 6).

Each type of cancer has its own guidelines for staging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 heading css-1i7gs84" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="lung_cancer_staging"&gt;Lung cancer staging&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each stage has several combinations of size and spread that can fall into that category. For instance, the primary tumor in a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/common-vegetable-eaten-just-3-times-a-week-lowers-risk-of-heart-attacks-and-some-cancers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stage III cancer&lt;/a&gt; could be smaller than in a Stage II cancer, but other factors put it at a more advanced stage.

Societies around the world are "&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1487139/full" target="_blank"&gt;dismally unprepared&lt;/a&gt;" for an aging population, Foo wrote in the science journal Frontiers last month, and with his co-authors described AI and other technologies as "pivotal forces with the potential to drive a paradigm shift in healthcare."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Foo, artificial intelligence is set to play a "huge" role in elderly care in Singapore, both in terms of helping clinicians manage non-acute conditions and in overseeing administrative tasks such as monitoring the availability of hospital beds, he said in an email to CNBC. "As the elderly in Singapore get more IT savvy, we see them turning to teleconsultations and digital tools that utilize AI technology," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is also being used to detect diseases earlier, an area of personal interest for Dr Han Ei Chew, a research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. He said his late mother's diabetic eye disease could have been diagnosed — and treated — earlier had AI testing methods been available when she was alive, as they are are now. "That would have been so useful when the family was going through that journey," Chew told CNBC by phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big focus for Singapore is "aging in place," according to Chew. "We can deploy the AI, but it isn't about fully replacing human care ... it is really about assisting the caregivers and helping seniors to stay independent and age in place," he told CNBC via video call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chew said Singapore's Housing and Development Board is even offering built-in home technology to &lt;a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/smart-hdb-town-page/assistive-living-technologies" target="_blank"&gt;detect when someone falls&lt;/a&gt; down, with an alert sent to a resident's next of kin or connected to a call center for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These types of monitoring technology need to be used carefully, Chew said, in whatever jurisdiction they are deployed. "The AI should empower the seniors and not strip them of control. They still need to have the choice to opt in, set boundaries, and, more importantly, to turn it off when they want," he told CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A care 'co-pilot'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not only Singapore that is looking at using AI for elderly care. In the United States, Sensi.AI is a fast-growing "care co-pilot" that monitors elderly people using audio devices that are usually plugged into three areas of their homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company co-founder and CEO Romi Gubes said the technology can provide caregivers with more than 100 different insights, alerting them to early signs of urinary tract or respiratory infections, or to falls or cognitive decline. "We're combining multiple indicators that are coming from audio," Gubes told CNBC by video call. "Think about, for example, respiratory infection. This will [take into account] the cadence of the coughing, the frequency, the type of coughing, together with ... complaints around fever, dizziness," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sensi.AI is installed in a home, it creates a "baseline" over two weeks, noting a range of "acoustic indicators," Gubes said, including non-verbal sounds like objects being moved, footsteps or snores, which it combines with its team's clinical knowledge. Once the AI knows the baseline sounds in a home, it can alert caregivers to any audio anomalies that might suggest a health issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gubes said Sensi is being used by "tens of thousands" of seniors in the U.S. and a spokesperson said the company is in discussions about a potential expansion in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ageism in AI&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts CNBC spoke to warned that AI must be used carefully when it comes to senior health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foo warned that the over-use of AI in consultations might lead to "poorer health outcomes" as not all elderly people can use technology, and he warned that it must be correctly designed to avoid "perpetuating digital ageism." Indeed, the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/09-02-2022-ensuring-artificial-intelligence-(ai)-technologies-for-health-benefit-older-people" target="_blank"&gt;cautioned&lt;/a&gt;, "The implicit and explicit biases of society, including around age, are often replicated in AI technologies," and its 2022 &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/351503/9789240040793-eng.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;policy brief&lt;/a&gt; urged developers to have older people participate in the design of new technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Singapore, the government's "&lt;a href="https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/3/b1fd5713-8ff9-46d5-9911-0f233f2a8b31/refreshed-action-plan-for-successful-ageing-2023.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Action Plan for Successful Ageing&lt;/a&gt;" details its aims, such as to reach 550,000 seniors with a health and wellness program and reduce hospital deaths from 61% to 51% between 2023 and 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Foo said seniors' opinions needed to be taken into account when determining how AI can address their health needs. "Like all new initiatives, failure will be inevitable if the target audience, i.e. the elderly, are not on board. We [need] to hear their voices and tailor the national health-AI strategy to suit their needs while not removing the human element of healthcare. That is the challenge," he told CNBC by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Chew, the approach to elderly care will need to blend human and machine, describing it as "high tech, but high touch." "The AI is probably best used as an extra set of eyes, ears and the robots [are an] extra set of hands, but not as a replacement for the high touch human care giving," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 23:06:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPLU96TlJCQjJQdXgzYW4yZGVPSnhpWlRLaGxDQTgyQ0NHV0p3OWZFU2VaRDE2aHZQa01rcTVKWndmZVdnaXFYX1NxZFBRZ05oazVjbmFUNVBoOHY1QWRWSVdJNHY5a1VQZ2trX3kzVlZQNTJYcTNXdWlTTHZ2X3pnNHRzajhDRWFWVjdjdG5qQXRrMVNObmFPakJ1Q2JkdHd2Rkg5bTNLT1XSAa4BQVVfeXFMTlU0QXFIamE1RkFGUWlPd2xLbDh6czFwNVJnNVJydXNTVXZ4MXpsdUotOUoycllDZ01rZlNRZnpVb29MN1hMU3JvMktpTXhvTU1qY0RYU2E4dWNrRGFJaUduYmFRSG1FUnJJaGpMWDJlakJpdGQ1bUhMbjNTb1FtMW9BbHRwcUdLT0YtSS1VV3NNWExOUDV4blNnZmhucUdQbUVQN290M25uQXd1T3BB</guid></item><item><title>This Common Blood Pressure Drug Extends Lifespan And Slows Aging in Animals - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxQb3BxOG16SlRqSUp3SHNrNlFDakZReHg0NjluYnR2MTJfZXRORmhVLU9mTXhFOTJZMGduZlhCaHFoOUlOa0RWQWlKVnF6Zkpuem81M1lhYlZyVUdmUEFLY0hVd0VxbjJmaUtxaXQ5TXJRb0NBR21vNGpUaWUxU3JrSGNnbEVUc1dPNGJQcy1tY2ZZYUdRWF9vTTk4V1ZkaEdhYXQ5V2ZCaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The hypertension drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilmenidine"&gt;rilmenidine&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to slow down aging in worms, an effect that in humans could hypothetically help us live longer and keep us healthier in our latter years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown rilmenidine mimics the effects of caloric restriction on a cellular level. Reducing available energy while maintaining nutrition within the body has been shown to extend lifespans &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24146-z"&gt;in several animal models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this translates to human biology, or is a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/skipping-meals-could-be-much-worse-for-you-than-we-realized"&gt;potential risk to our health&lt;/a&gt;, is a topic of &lt;a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2020/can-calorie-restriction-extend-your-lifespan/"&gt;ongoing debate&lt;/a&gt;. Finding ways to achieve the same benefits without the costs of extreme calorie cutting could lead to new ways to improve health in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study published in 2023, young and old &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worms treated with the drug – which is normally used to treat high blood pressure – lived longer and presented higher measures in a variety of health markers in the same way as restricting calories, as the scientists had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we have been able to show in animals that rilmenidine can increase lifespan," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/01/23/hypertension-drug-could-be-repurposed-to-delay-ageing-study-finds/"&gt;said molecular biogerontologist João Pedro Magalhães&lt;/a&gt;, from the University of Birmingham in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are now keen to explore if rilmenidine may have other clinical applications."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; worm is a favorite for studies, because many of its genes have similarities to counterparts in our genome. Yet in spite of these similarities, it is still a rather distant relation to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144581" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg" alt="Various cell types illustrated in shades of pink" class="size-full wp-image-144581" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642-600x334.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some human cell types and their nuclei on the left, compared to cells from &lt;em&gt;C. elegans &lt;/em&gt;on the right. (&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:C_elegans_cell_and_nucleus_sizes.svg"&gt;J.J.Froehlich/CC BY-SA 4.0/Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests showed that gene activity associated with caloric restriction could be seen in the kidney and liver tissues of mice treated with rilmenidine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, some of the changes that caloric restriction gives in animals and thought to confer certain health benefits also appear with a hypertension drug that many people already take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another discovery was that a biological signaling receptor called nish-1 was crucial in the effectiveness of rilmenidine. This particular chemical structure could be targeted in future attempts to improve lifespan and slow down aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that the lifespan-extending effects of rilmenidine were abolished when nish-1 was deleted," the researchers explained in their &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Critically, rescuing the nish-1 receptor reinstated the increase in lifespan upon treatment with rilmenidine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-calorie diets are hard to follow and come with a variety of side effects, such as hair thinning, dizziness, and brittle bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's early days still, but the thinking is that this hypertension drug could confer the same benefits as a low-calorie diet while being easier on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg" alt="A man sitting on a couch taking his blood pressure" class="size-full wp-image-141684" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Rilmenidine is normally used to treat high blood pressure. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEwj7ICt3Y/"&gt;Prostock-studio/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes rilmenidine a promising candidate as an anti-aging drug is that it can be taken orally, it's already widely prescribed, and its side effects are rare and relatively mild (they include palpitations, insomnia, and drowsiness in a few cases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a long way to go yet in figuring out if rilmenidine would work as an anti-aging drug for actual humans, but the early signs in these worm and mice tests are promising. We now know much more about what rilmenidine can do, and how it operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With a global aging population, the benefits of delaying aging, even if slightly, are immense," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/01/23/hypertension-drug-could-be-repurposed-to-delay-ageing-study-finds/"&gt;said Magalhães&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i data-stringify-type="italic"&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in January 2023.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
