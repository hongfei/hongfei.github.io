While doctors have repeatedly recommended factors like eating well and trying to do new activities to support brain health, research over the last few years has found two habits worth prioritizing in your daily life: &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63021061/how-many-miles-should-you-walk-a-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; and spending time with loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every walk you take is a step toward a sharper mind in more ways than one. A growing body of research shows that regular walking can boost memory, sharpen focus, and even slow cognitive decline—including reducing risk of developing dementia. Separate research has shown that walking can boost creativity, too. People who were physically active—including with walking—at some point within the last 3.5 hours showed processing speeds equivalent to someone four years younger while playing brain games, a recent &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62895429/walking-brain-health-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/abm/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/abm/kaae059/7828202?redirectedFrom=fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Annals of Behavioral Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Annals of Behavioral Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second game changer for your thinker: socialization. Your brain thrives on connection, and research backs this up. A separate body of research shows that regular social connection can shore up memory, problem-solving, and also reduce &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63902567/b12-dementia-risk-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dementia risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;. One study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(22)00199-4/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Lancet Healthy Longevity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Healthy Longevity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, found that people who interacted with family and friends on a weekly or monthly basis had a slower rate of memory decline than those who socialized less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/doctors/howard-jonathan-edward/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jonathan Howard, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jonathan Howard, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is a neurologist at NYC Health and Hospitals/Bellevue. &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/geriatric-medicine/ca/santa-monica/scott-kaiser-1205042470" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scott Kaiser, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scott Kaiser, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is the director of geriatric cognitive health for the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center. &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev, MD,&lt;/a&gt; is medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, it's worth exploring whether doing both at once would be a double whammy for brain health. While this powerhouse combo hasn’t technically been studied formally just yet, doctors say there might be something to this health hack. Let's investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Walking With A Loved One Is A Smart Combo For Brain Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few mechanisms at play. One is the fact that walking is simply a great form of exercise. “Anything that improves overall cardiovascular health will help reduce dementia risk,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/doctors/howard-jonathan-edward/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jonathan Howard, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jonathan Howard, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at NYC Health and Hospitals/Bellevue. Your brain needs healthy blood vessels to function properly, get nutrients, and remove toxins, and there's an established &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-factors-heart-disease-linked-dementia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:link;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; between heart disease and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting your steps in can help support overall health—and that will do your brain a solid too, says &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev, MD,&lt;/a&gt; medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. “Overall health is important for brain health,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking directly boosts brain health, too. It &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.122.039919" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:triggers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;triggers&lt;/a&gt; the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that supports nerve cell growth and survival in the brain and spinal cord. BDNF is involved in crucial tasks like memory and learning, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/geriatric-medicine/ca/santa-monica/scott-kaiser-1205042470" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scott Kaiser, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scott Kaiser, MD&lt;/a&gt;, director of geriatric cognitive health for the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center. “That helps to create a well-functioning brain network,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking also can help reduce your overall stress levels. Stress can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763421000531" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:negatively impact;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;negatively impact&lt;/a&gt; your brain on a cellular level when it goes unchecked, and ramping up your step count can help counteract this, says Dr. Kaiser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time with loved ones is an &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.19111158" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-stressor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-stressor&lt;/a&gt;, too, and can support &lt;a href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/102/13/1009" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:good heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;good heart health&lt;/a&gt; which, again, ultimately boosts brain health, Dr. Kaiser says. There may even be an indirect link here: “If you’re feeling well connected, you may be more likely to make better choices for your health—and brain health—around drinking, eating, and substance abuse,” Dr. Kaiser says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Women's Sneakers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether walking around the house or around the neighborhood, these “perfectly comfortable and lightweight shoes are a great value at an affordable price,” says Jacqueline Andriakos, &lt;em&gt;WH&lt;/em&gt; executive health and fitness director.

If you want to set a lofty goal, Dr. Howard suggests trying to walk for 30 minutes at a time on most days of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it can be tricky to consistently block out that time with family and friends, Dr. Kaiser just recommends doing what you can. “Most evidence suggests that inactivity is bad and any amount of activity is a good amount,” he says. “But, in general, more is better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If going for longer walks with loved ones is hard to pull off, Dr. Kaiser recommends trying to squeeze in “&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64479203/can-walking-keep-you-in-shape/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:exercise snacks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;exercise snacks&lt;/a&gt;,” like walking out of the office at the end of the night with your work buddy or taking a lap around the neighborhood with your mom during a visit instead of catching up on the couch. You can also try taking up your own &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64516114/benefits-of-walking-for-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walking habit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walking habit&lt;/a&gt; and socializing by chatting on the phone with loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, you can take up this new habit any time. “I can’t think of any age group that won’t benefit from this,” Dr. Kaiser says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot that goes into &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62854242/how-to-improve-brain-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:supporting good brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;supporting good brain health&lt;/a&gt;, but walking with a loved one checks off a lot of boxes and gets in some quality social time, too. “It makes sense to kill two birds with one stone,” Dr. Howard says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 17:19:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1GWWFFSUNIcjg0Qk5aS3NFalN1Sl9WRi1BRlQyYk1sak5JOEJQU3praDl2M2dBWGVZLVBZTE9IWmlrdkVXamxiLVlXaGVKYzNSRVJTcVI0bWZuVlgtLWFUX0d2X3dybkg3Y1h4Q0hyNTUzeFVGeGd5RA</guid></item><item><title>我参观了被世界上最具传染性的疾病袭击的美国小镇……零地带的可怕现实--《每日邮报》 | I visited American town being hit by world's most infectious disease... the terrifying reality in ground zero - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPRVVqSGNRX0hfRy03ZzlvRDBkQTBlZS1MWDEzcDlybHBTQlJiQmhrdVFORElsc0pGN1JJRXIzU0JTZWU0Q0JTQWNORXE3dWo2YUptRzNhVUJfQWdPRklMWGxZcHRuUmRwTG5nOVJTeC1wckt1Q3l2V3pvWTlEXzNadEJZeU5IU3BGX0didWVCc2pDQWNmX3dQdUg3Rnhad1ZCX2ZhONIBqgFBVV95cUxPRmZWS0ZZNVYzcTItODVwc05DMEw5MUtMTFFHTGtIc0lWNWt1bVdGM0tmd1hTNDl1TXRhempYYno3MlpmcjZoZHBuQmRxWXRKXzVkZ1NmRk5JX1JyVzE4T25EM1QtSGZnNEV2R0VEZ01TaGJFd3YwbWhBdDNzM0ZYR2Q4LS02M1A5aldJNjhCenpNaElyQ29fcHVpTDZ4blJuMlMtM2FqWThHZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I'm in a busy supplements store in West &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-46506d40-1c76-11f0-805a-97be76b02f96"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; when a woman walks in coughing as she weaves through the shelves of vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A store clerk approached, and the two spoke in hushed, urgent tones about a 'very sick' child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was then quietly directed to a display of cod liver oil bottles labeled 'for kids' at the front of the store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her cough — &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14618263/Michigan-state-measles-Ingham-County-baby-girl.html"&gt;a potential telltale sign of measles&lt;/a&gt; — no one batted an eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Customers kept browsing, seemingly unaware they may have just been exposed to the most infectious disease on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I'm in the rural town of Seminole — the epicenter of America's deadliest measles outbreak in a decade, one that has already claimed the lives of two young girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This town of 7,000 people, located in Gaines County near the New Mexico border, is a breeding ground for anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, reflected in the fact it has one of the lowest measles vaccination rates in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only around 82 percent of residents are immunized, well below the 95 percent needed to stop measles from spreading. Many here choose to rely instead on 'natural remedies' like those sold in this busy store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cod liver oil contains vitamin A, which some evidence suggests may help support the immune system as it fights a measles infection. The &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14559743/children-texas-poisoned-rfk-jr-measles-cases.html"&gt;supplements have been promoted&lt;/a&gt; by vaccine skeptic and HHS Secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;EPICENTER: A sign at the measles testing center in Seminole. The center is quietly getting busier as the reality of the outbreak sets in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;BEHIND THE HEADLINES: I'm in the epicenter of America's deadliest measles outbreak in a decade, one that has already claimed the lives of two young girls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Official figures suggest 62 patients have been hospitalized with measles in West Texas and nearly 600 people have been sickened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But having been here, on the ground, that number feels like a massive understatement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's nearly impossible to go anywhere in Seminole without meeting someone who personally knows someone affected by measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over coffee in a local cafe, I met a woman who described how her neighbors — an entire family — had all come down with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Later, in a nearby parking lot, another woman told me how three different families she knew had all been sickened.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials continue to stress that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles, but the message appears to be falling on deaf ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seminole is home to a tight-knit community of Mennonites — a reserved and generally well-off Christian sect that often favors natural remedies over modern medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is nothing in Mennonite scripture that explicitly forbids vaccines, many in the community choose to avoid them, swayed by local rumors of dangerous side effects and the belief that vaccines simply don't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, public health officials have urged those who are unvaccinated and exposed — or showing symptoms — to isolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in practice, there's little evidence that this guidance is being widely followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;ANTIVAX LOCALS: Judy (left) said her family hasn't got the MMR vaccine because they don't like the things in it. Joselyn doesn't want to get her children vaccinated despite the outbreak because she claims to know people who've had adverse reactions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One Mennonite woman in a blue-and-white dress, holding a bag of groceries, told me she believed measles was actually 'good for the immune system,' and that children could benefit from catching it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Outside a gym, another woman said she preferred not to vaccinate her children because of 'all the potential side effects.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her fears about side effects are, of course, overblown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93 percent effective against measles; two doses offer 97 percent protection — and drastically reduce the risk of serious complications or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yes, there are side effects from the MMR vaccine — the most common being a sore arm, mild fever, or a light rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases, more serious reactions have been reported, including seizures in children under 23 months. But these occur in fewer than one in 10,000 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles itself is far more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to CDC data, about one in five unvaccinated children infected with measles requires hospitalization. One in 20 develops pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around one in 1,000 suffers encephalitis — swelling of the brain that can lead to permanent damage and, sadly, often death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Seminole, that grim statistic has become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;TRAGIC: Eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand is the second child to die in the escalating measles outbreak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14597353/measles-outbreak-west-texas-daisy-hildebrand-pictured.html"&gt;Eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand &lt;/a&gt;and six-year-old Kayley Fehr both lost their lives to measles complications &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They mark not only a local tragedy, but also the first confirmed measles-related deaths in the US since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I met with Daisy's father outside a gas station, his eyes rimmed red and voice cracking with grief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was adamant she wasn't killed by measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She did not die of the measles,' he said. 'If there's one thing you should know, it's that. She was failed.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was also opposed to the vaccine. 'The [MMR] vaccine ain't worth a damn,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My brother's family got it and they all still got sick — worse than my unvaccinated kids. This isn't about the vaccine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daisy and Kayley are buried both buried the Reinlander cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their graves are modest, marked only with simple plaques — quiet reminders of the tragedy that has rocked this small town. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But even in mourning, misinformation is taking root. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Religion clearly plays a role in the opposition to vaccination in Seminole, but something dangerous is also happening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group co-founded by RFK Jr, has been in contact with the families of the deceased and is now actively pushing the narrative that measles wasn't to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That message is reverberating through the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Local rumor mills are spinning a different story — one where measles isn't nearly as dangerous as health officials claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I got measles when I was young,' said Jake, a farmhand standing outside the Southern Rose cafe in the town's center, chewing on a toothpick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Business as usual: Guests in Perikas, the main restaurant in Seminole. It was packed when I visited, and there wasn't a single sign warning about measles in sight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It wasn't that bad, I remember I had to be at home for a bit, but I got lots of ice cream'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To combat the outbreak, local health officials have opened a measles testing and vaccination center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What began as a small operation in a parking lot has since expanded into a large, drive-thru facility — a sign perhaps that people are beginning to take the crisis seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Workers at the drive-thru clinic told me that, in the early days of the outbreak, Seminole felt like a ghost town. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People were afraid — not of the virus, but of being seen at the testing site and judged by neighbors for engaging with public health services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like a lot of towns across the US, there has been an erosion of trust in public institutions which stem from lockdowns and vaccine mandates during Covid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now that the clinic has been moved to a shed, attendance has crept up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;STATE VISIT: Peter Hildebrand with his wife Eva and two of his children. They met with anti-vaccine crusader RFK Jr, health secretary, after the death of their daughter Daisy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite cooperation from the public slowly starting to creep up, not everyone is on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Those two deaths, now they were tragic,' a farmer told me, before adding, 'but most of the time, measles really is a mild illness'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only about 82 percent of children entering kindergarten in Gaines County, where Seminole is located, are vaccinated against measles — well below the 95 percent threshold experts say is needed for herd immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also below the national average of 91.6 percent coverage by 24 months of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Local officials have attempted to stem the spread by putting up posters warning of the outbreak and directing people to the testing center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the flyers are mostly confined to government buildings like the courthouse and county office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I didn't see them in places that actually draw people in: restaurants, local stores, or even Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;GROUND ZERO: The above map shows Gaines County (in dark orange) and the surrounding counties where measles cases have been diagnosed. It appears that this outbreak is very much just at the beginning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the supplement store — a known hotspot for anti-vaccine sentiment and where symptomatic people continue to gather — staff told me they've had no visit from any public health department representatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While anti-vaccine rhetoric echoes loudly across Seminole, it's not the only voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Outside the Walmart, I met a Mennonite woman who told me she'd chosen to vaccinate all of her children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's the right thing to do,' she said. 'To protect their health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, the mesles crisis is growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of mid-April, there have been almost 800 confirmed measles cases across 24 states — the highest number since 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if the current pace continues, 2025 could surpass that year’s total of 1,274 cases — making it the worst outbreak in the US since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two deaths in Seminole are the only confirmed measles fatalities so far this year, but many fear there could be more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Widespread federal health cuts — including about $12 billion slashed from health services under the Trump administration — have local health officials in Texas concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the vaccination site here remains open, for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 16:32:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPRVVqSGNRX0hfRy03ZzlvRDBkQTBlZS1MWDEzcDlybHBTQlJiQmhrdVFORElsc0pGN1JJRXIzU0JTZWU0Q0JTQWNORXE3dWo2YUptRzNhVUJfQWdPRklMWGxZcHRuUmRwTG5nOVJTeC1wckt1Q3l2V3pvWTlEXzNadEJZeU5IU3BGX0didWVCc2pDQWNmX3dQdUg3Rnhad1ZCX2ZhONIBqgFBVV95cUxPRmZWS0ZZNVYzcTItODVwc05DMEw5MUtMTFFHTGtIc0lWNWt1bVdGM0tmd1hTNDl1TXRhempYYno3MlpmcjZoZHBuQmRxWXRKXzVkZ1NmRk5JX1JyVzE4T25EM1QtSGZnNEV2R0VEZ01TaGJFd3YwbWhBdDNzM0ZYR2Q4LS02M1A5aldJNjhCenpNaElyQ29fcHVpTDZ4blJuMlMtM2FqWThHZw</guid></item><item><title>弗吉尼亚州卫生官员确认该州首例2025年麻疹病例–新闻中心-弗吉尼亚州卫生部(.gov) | Virginia Health Officials Confirm First 2025 Measles Case in the State – Newsroom - Virginia Department of Health (.gov)</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxQUkQ1XzlLR2J3OUFvZjVqczlqd0tVWWs0RVBfclVTQm40RUotd3NfUWtZUnlsaEw2Z1hEc0g4SzRnOHV3SktNSk53d1ZOTkV3YWRqaHViSERfU1I4VndIOGtkZFNGX3g1ZVF3VGZjWFpRYjdVcHRHVkppXzVYamFjZDdGa2VBekZIYzRaR0RwZlF0OFBmREhldTktZVlpaV91WDBtLURxYUxGLVNwb0xVYnlWSVNIbURZVFlDcGRnbzFJUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – &lt;/strong&gt;April 19, 2025&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Media Contact:&lt;/strong&gt; Brookie Crawford, &lt;a href="mailto:brookie.crawford@vdh.virginia.gov"&gt;brookie.crawford@vdh.virginia.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virginia Health Officials Confirm First 2025 Measles Case in the State&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Virginia Department of Health is Working to Identify People Who Are at Risk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RICHMOND, Va. – The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) is reporting the state’s first measles case of the year. The patient is a child (0-4 years) in the Northwest Region who recently traveled internationally. To protect the family’s privacy, VDH will not provide any additional information about the patient. Health officials are coordinating efforts to identify anyone who might have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This first case of measles in Virginia this year is a reminder of how easily this highly contagious disease can spread, particularly with international travel,” said &lt;strong&gt;VDH State Epidemiologist Laurie Forlano, D.O., M.P.H.&lt;/strong&gt; “Vaccination remains our best defense against measles and is safe and highly effective at protecting people and preventing outbreaks. We urge Virginians, especially those planning to travel, to check their vaccination status, talk to their health care provider, and get the MMR vaccine if needed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listed below are the dates, times, and locations of potential exposure sites in Virginia:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiser Permanente Caton Hill Medical Center, Advanced Urgent Care, located at 13285 Minnieville Road in Woodbridge on Tuesday, April 15 from 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiser Permanente Fredericksburg Medical Center, Pediatrics Department, located at 1201 Hospital Drive in Fredericksburg on Wednesday, April 16 from noon to 5 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should you do if you were at the above locations on the day and time specified?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have never received a measles containing vaccine (either the measles, mumps and rubella [MMR] vaccine or a measles-only vaccine which is available in other countries), you may be at risk of developing measles.&lt;strong&gt; Anyone who might have been exposed and is considered to be at risk of developing measles should contact their healthcare provider immediately. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch for symptoms for 21 days after the date of your potential exposure.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you notice symptoms of measles, immediately isolate yourself by staying home.&lt;/strong&gt; Contact your healthcare provider right away.&lt;strong&gt; If you need to seek healthcare, call ahead before going to your healthcare provider’s office or the emergency room &lt;/strong&gt;to notify them that you may have been exposed to measles and ask them to call the local health department. This call will help protect other patients and staff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone with an immunocompromising condition should consult with their healthcare provider if they have questions or develop symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have received two doses of a measles-containing vaccine, or were born before 1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have received only one dose of a measles-containing vaccine, you are very likely to be protected and your risk of being infected with measles from any of these exposures is very low. However, to achieve the highest level of protection, contact your healthcare provider about getting a second vaccine dose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/"&gt;Measles&lt;/a&gt; is a highly contagious illness that can spread easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. Measles symptoms usually appear in two stages. In the first stage, most people have a fever of greater than 101 degrees, runny nose, watery red eyes, and a cough. These symptoms usually start seven to fourteen days after being exposed. The second stage starts three to five days after symptoms start, when a rash begins to appear on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. People with measles are contagious from four days before the rash appears through four days after the rash appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is preventable through a safe and effective MMR vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are given to provide lifetime protection. Virginia has high measles vaccination rates, with approximately 95% of kindergarteners fully vaccinated against measles. However, infants who are too young to be vaccinated, and others who are not vaccinated, are very susceptible to infection if they are exposed to measles. Infants six months through 11 months of age who will be traveling internationally, or to an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/"&gt;outbreak setting&lt;/a&gt;, should receive one dose of MMR vaccine prior to travel. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have questions about the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check your immunization status, call your healthcare provider or request your vaccination records using the &lt;a href="https://redcap.vdh.virginia.gov/redcap/surveys/?s=NCMHWL3HK8"&gt;VDH Immunization Record Request Form&lt;/a&gt;. Virginia residents with additional questions about their potential exposure can email &lt;a href="mailto:epi_response@vdh.virginia.gov"&gt;epi_response@vdh.virginia.gov&lt;/a&gt; or contact your &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/local-health-districts/"&gt;local health department&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There's now lots of evidence which &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-a-daily-glass-of-milk-really-could-reduce-bowel-cancer-risk-an-oncologist-explains-247301"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-eating-yoghurt-regularly-could-lower-your-risk-of-bowel-cancer-251942"&gt;our&lt;/a&gt; own &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-cut-your-risk-of-cancer-by-an-oncology-consultant-245858"&gt;diets&lt;/a&gt; and the foods we eat can influence the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/king-charles-is-changing-his-diet-to-keep-his-cancer-at-bay-heres-what-the-evidence-says-245582"&gt;outcome&lt;/a&gt; if we are unlucky enough to suffer from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="158410" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are especially interested in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24861-8"&gt;how this happens&lt;/a&gt;, in particular the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind these associations. This would better inform &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24861-8"&gt;nutritional recommendations&lt;/a&gt; and help us understand how cancer forms so we can prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm9805"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; has identified a molecular link between linoleic acid, a common fat contained in cooking oils, and aggressive breast cancer, renewing the discussion about dietary choices and cancer risk. The findings, while significant, require careful interpretation to avoid unnecessary alarm and give useful guidance to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Common fatty acid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleic_acid"&gt;Linoleic acid&lt;/a&gt; is an omega-6 fatty acid which is found in abundant quantities in soybean, sunflower and corn oils. Researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York showed it can directly activate a growth pathway in triple-negative breast cancer cells – a type of breast cancer especially known for its &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32125284/"&gt;aggressiveness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31927455/"&gt;limited treatment options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triple negative breast cancer makes up about 15% of all breast cancer cases, but because breast cancer is so common, this affects a lot of people. The researchers found that linoleic acid binds to a protein called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FABP5"&gt;FABP5&lt;/a&gt; (fatty acid-binding protein 5), which is at high levels in these cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This binding triggers the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-019-0199-y"&gt;mTORC1 pathway&lt;/a&gt; – a critical regulator of cell growth and metabolism – fuelling tumour progression in preclinical research, including animal studies. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37596643/"&gt;My current research&lt;/a&gt; focuses on this pathway in a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202310.1387/v2"&gt;normal and cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm9805"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, mice fed a high linoleic-acid diet developed larger tumours, suggesting dietary intake may exacerbate this cancer's growth. There was a link to people too: elevated FABP5 and linoleic acid levels were detected in blood samples from triple-negative breast cancer patients, strengthening the biological plausibility of this link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr John Blenis, the senior author of the paper, said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery helps clarify the relationship between dietary fats and cancer, and sheds light on how to define which patients might benefit the most from specific nutritional recommendations in a personalised manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also possible that the implications extend beyond triple negative breast cancer to other tumours such as prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linoleic acid is an &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37513547/"&gt;essential fatty acid&lt;/a&gt; so it must be obtained from food. It plays a role in skin health, cell membrane structure and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31785494/"&gt;inflammation regulation&lt;/a&gt;. However, modern diets, which are rich in processed foods, ultraprocessed foods and seed oils, often provide excessive omega-6 fats, including linoleic acid, while lacking omega-3s, which are found in fish, flaxseeds and walnuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wIhbYA5QLEw?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This imbalance could promote &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00658-5"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, which is a well known &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6831096/"&gt;contributor to cancer&lt;/a&gt; and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study therefore suggests that linoleic acid may directly drive cancer growth in specific contexts. This challenges earlier observational studies that found no clear association between dietary linoleic acid and overall breast cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a 2023  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="158410" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 14 studies in over 350,000 women concluded that linoleic acid intake had &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10271020/"&gt;no significant effect&lt;/a&gt; on breast cancer risk in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discrepancy highlights the importance of researchers looking specifically at cancer subtypes and also individual factors, such as FABP5 levels in cancers themselves. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10558966/"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; showed that linoleic acid was protective against breast cancer, which demonstrates why it's important to consider everything in context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't panic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media headlines can often oversimplify complex research. While this new study highlights a plausible mechanism linking linoleic acid to cancer growth, it does not prove that cooking oils cause breast cancer – far from it. Other factors, such as genetics, overall diet and environmental exposures, play significant roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings do not warrant blanket avoidance of seed oils but suggest moderation and selectivity, especially for high-risk individuals. Many oils such as olive oil contain less linoleic acid and higher monounsaturated or saturated fats, which are more stable at high heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do also consider &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00879-6"&gt;eating more fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; as part of a healthy, balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GMZ1NVSPh6I?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03570-5"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; that comprehensively analysed eating habits over 30 years showed that diets that are rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and low-fat dairy products were linked to healthy ageing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that study, the Harvard team followed more than 100,000 people between 1986 and 2016. Fewer than 10% of respondents achieved healthy ageing, defined by a lack of 11 major chronic diseases and no impairment in cognitive, physical or mental function by the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisations like the World Cancer Research Fund emphasise that moderate use of vegetable oils is safe and that &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/action-on-obesity"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, not specific fats, is the primary dietary driver of cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study, then, underscores the importance of contextualising dietary fats in cancer research. While linoleic acid's role in triple-negative breast cancer is a critical discovery, it's one piece of a vast puzzle. A balanced, wholefood diet remains an important cornerstone of cancer prevention, and a strategy everyone can adopt.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254255/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

	A new &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5199076" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; models the impact of the implosion of U.S.-funded &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/disease/" id="auto-tag_disease" data-tag="disease"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; treatment and prevention in the developing world — and suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/elon-musk/" id="auto-tag_elon-musk" data-tag="elon-musk"&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/marco-rubio/" id="auto-tag_marco-rubio" data-tag="marco-rubio"&gt;Marco Rubio&lt;/a&gt; will go down as among history’s greatest monsters if funding and effective administration are not restored.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In short: Tens of millions will die, millions of them children. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The second Trump administration began by &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/u-s-foreign-aid-freeze-dissolution-of-usaid-timeline-of-events/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;driving a stake&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-musk-interview-usaid-humanitarian-collapse-1235259251/"&gt;the heart&lt;/a&gt; of America’s foreign aid programs. Led by Musk, and enabled by Secretary of State Rubio, the U.S. Agency for International Development (&lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/usaid/" id="auto-tag_usaid" data-tag="usaid"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt;) has been shuttered, and its life-saving programs in global health either defunded or thrown into disarray.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The new paper is not yet finalized or peer-reviewed; it was published as part of a project called &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5199076" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preprints with The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;But it offers a first glimpse of the potential impact of the Trump administration’s cut-and-run approach to foreign aid — fueled by lies and red-pill conspiracy theories promoted by Musk about USAID being a “&lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1896930796310806835" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;radical left&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1886102414194835755?lang=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;criminal&lt;/a&gt;” organization that deserved to be sent through the “&lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1886307316804263979?lang=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;wood chipper&lt;/a&gt;.”

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The study models the collapse of nearly $13 billion in U.S. funding for health programs in developing countries, including for the treatment and prevention of &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/hiv/" id="auto-tag_hiv" data-tag="hiv"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and tuberculosis; family planning; and maternal and child health. It forecasts the increase in global death and suffering through 2040 if this funding — which accounts for nearly a quarter of global donor investment — is zeroed out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The findings shock the conscience. Cessation of U.S. aid will lead to people in poor countries dying, in genocidal proportions, of preventable and treatable diseases. That includes more than 15 million additional deaths from HIV/&lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/aids/" id="auto-tag_aids" data-tag="aids"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt;, more than 2 million additional casualties from tuberculosis, and nearly 8 million additional children dead of other maladies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The impact on family planning is similarly stark — with tens of millions of new unplanned pregnancies (ranging between 40-55 million). Counter to the administration’s stated “pro-life” agenda, the collapse of American aid is projected to lead to as many as 16 million “unsafe abortions.”



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	According to the study, this mass suffering would be avoided by continuing U.S. funding on a “status quo” level from 2024 commitments. (Current funding for these programs represents about 0.2 percent of America’s &lt;a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;$6.75 trillion&lt;/a&gt; in annual federal spending.)

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The deadliest projected impact comes from the hobbling of PEPFAR, or the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — an enormous humanitarian accomplishment of the George W. Bush presidency that has made anti-retroviral medication widely available in the developing world, particularly in African countries hardest hit by HIV. The program has been credited with &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar-latest-global-results-factsheet-dec-2024/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;saving tens of millions of lives&lt;/a&gt; and preventing HIV transmission to nearly 8 million children since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The GOP-led Congress shares blame here, too. PEPFAR’s authorization &lt;a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/pepfar-misses-reauthorization-deadline-whats-next-global-hiv-fight" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;expired&lt;/a&gt; in March, and the current Congress has &lt;a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/pepfar-misses-reauthorization-deadline-whats-next-global-hiv-fight" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;provided funding&lt;/a&gt; only through September — throwing the entire program’s future into doubt. Regardless of appropriated funds, however, the chaotic governance of Trump, Musk, and Rubio has monkey-wrenched the program on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	PEPFAR was supposed to be exempt from a 90-day funding “pause” the administration imposed on most foreign aid, but USAID administered a majority of PEPFAR aid and the agency now no longer exists, with its chipped remains being swept into the &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/state-department/" id="auto-tag_state-department" data-tag="state-department"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt;. International partners on the ground in places like South Africa have likened the Trump-Musk era to being &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77887npl2mo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;“pushed off a cliff.”&lt;/a&gt; The George W. Bush Presidential Center has blasted the new administration for having “&lt;a href="https://www.bushcenter.org/publications/two-minute-take-pepfar-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;gravely undermined PEPFAR&lt;/a&gt;.”



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The future of U.S. funding to prevent and treat tuberculosis, as well child and maternal health programs, is similarly uncertain. (By one estimate, a Trump freeze on TB funding has already killed &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/30/health/tuberculosis-impact-usaid-funding-intl-scli/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;11,000 people&lt;/a&gt;.) This gutting of medical aid comes atop the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/04/usaid-doge-children-starvation/682484/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;deadly havoc&lt;/a&gt; caused by the suspension of food aid to relieve famine in the world’s poorest countries. &lt;/p&gt;

	The authors of the preprint paper are stark in their warning about the impact of continued cuts, insisting that a U.S. withdrawal from its 2024 commitments “would reverse decades of progress in global health” and send levels of deaths and disease soaring to levels not seen since the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

These four reasons &lt;span class="plus" data-ga-track="caption expand"&gt;... More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="expanded-caption"&gt; explain why.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;getty&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to ending a marriage, women are often the ones who make the first move. This pattern is backed by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-71544-5_11" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-71544-5_11" aria-label="decades of research"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-71544-5_11"&gt;decades of research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Men report more desire for marriage than women and it’s been known to boost their health, career prospects and even life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For women, however, the trade-offs are murkier. Unmarried women often thrive more emotionally and physically than their married peers, while unmarried men face higher risks of loneliness, poor health and early death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/19485506241287960" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://doi.org/10.1177/19485506241287960" aria-label="research"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://doi.org/10.1177/19485506241287960"&gt;research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that women fare far better at being single than men do, with higher levels of satisfaction with their relationship status, life satisfaction, sexual satisfaction and a lower level of desire to have a partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, men’s reliance on marriage often runs so deep that they are less likely to initiate divorce, even when they’re unhappy with their partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are four reasons why men may find it difficult to leave a marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. They Feel Tied To Their Children&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many men, the choice to stay is not necessarily about their love for their partner, but rather a strong sense of responsibility towards their children. They may feel that leaving would mean failing their family, especially their children, even if the relationship itself no longer feels fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09649069.2021.1953857" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09649069.2021.1953857" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09649069.2021.1953857"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Social Welfare and Family Law&lt;/em&gt; exploring separated fathers’ understanding of “home,” many men described it not just as a physical space, but as a combination of emotions, relationships, routines and surroundings. Despite their efforts to engage in meaningful activities and create emotionally supportive environments, these fathers often experienced a sense of loss or insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their children didn’t always view their homes as their “main” home and often identified with their mother’s home as their “real home.” This perception made some fathers feel that their parenting efforts might not be fully recognized or valued. When their children weren’t present, the house often felt empty, which made them feel like home only truly existed when the children were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This emotional reality of feeling invisible or &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/02/07/3-reasons-behind-maternal-gatekeeping-according-to-a-psychologist/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/02/07/3-reasons-behind-maternal-gatekeeping-according-to-a-psychologist/" target="_self" aria-label="secondary"&gt;secondary&lt;/a&gt; is one many married men quietly contend with. So, even in the face of an unhappy relationship, they may choose to stay, driven more by duty, guilt or cultural expectations than by emotional connection or personal satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;2. They Fear The Loss Of Stability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many men, divorce brings not just emotional upheaval but also profound uncertainty about the future. Financial instability, loneliness and the disruption of familiar routines fuel a fear of the unknown. The prospect of starting over can feel overwhelming, compounded by the &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/02/14/3-reasons-the-sunk-cost-fallacy-keep-us-stuck-in-bad-relationships/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/02/14/3-reasons-the-sunk-cost-fallacy-keep-us-stuck-in-bad-relationships/" target="_self" aria-label="sunk-cost fallacy"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/02/14/3-reasons-the-sunk-cost-fallacy-keep-us-stuck-in-bad-relationships/"&gt;sunk-cost fallacy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of abandoning a long-term investment in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research highlights this tension. A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13607863.2024.2377264#abstract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13607863.2024.2377264#abstract" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13607863.2024.2377264#abstract"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Aging &amp;amp; Mental Health&lt;/em&gt; found that older divorcees often experience freedom and loneliness simultaneously. While some described liberation from unhappy marriages and the chance to pursue suppressed desires, others grappled with isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, men’s post-divorce trajectories differ from that of women’s. A 2018 &lt;em&gt;Sociological Inquiry &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soin.12253" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soin.12253" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soin.12253"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; revealed that men are more likely to seek remarriage, reflecting a persistent reliance on marriage for care and companionship. Women, by contrast, are more reluctant to marry, fearing more caregiving burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings underscore a paradox: men may stay in unfulfilling marriages due to fear of instability, yet they also depend on the institution emotionally. Even when divorce offers relief, the desire to rebuild marital bonds persists. This suggests that marriage remains a primary anchor for emotional security for many men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They’re Conditioned To Suppress Emotions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many men are not taught how to express vulnerability or even recognize emotional dissatisfaction, leading them to normalize their discontent. Over time, emotional suppression can cause men to accept unhappiness as “just a part of life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2015 &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407515574466" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407515574466" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407515574466"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Social and Personal Relationships &lt;/em&gt;suggests that when husbands suppress emotions, it harms relationship satisfaction, particularly early in marriage. As dissatisfaction grows, it alters how spouses manage emotions — often leaving both husbands and wives emotionally disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, this dynamic can create a sense of entrapment. Some men, despite feeling deeply unhappy, struggle to leave, either because they refuse to voice their needs or because they fear the consequences. For those from traditional backgrounds, divorce may be seen as failure or weakness, further locking them into unfulfilling marriages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They Lack Support Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While men tend to report having more same-sex friendships than women, these relationships &lt;a href="https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1978.tb02543.x?saml_referrer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1978.tb02543.x?saml_referrer" aria-label="are often not very close"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1978.tb02543.x?saml_referrer"&gt;are often not very close&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, intimate or emotionally open. Researchers suggest that several factors prevent emotional closeness between men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be due to societal expectations tied to traditional male roles — such as the pressure to compete, a fear of being perceived as weak, discomfort with vulnerability and homophobia — as well as a lack of positive role models for male emotional connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, they often do not find the tools or safe spaces to open up. This may make them feel like being in a dysfunctional relationship is better than separating from their partner and facing isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men’s reluctance to leave unhappy marriages is rarely about one factor. It’s an entanglement of emotional suppression, fear of loneliness, cultural expectations and the absence of strong support systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many stay out of habit or the hope that things will return to how they once were. But holding on to memories or enduring emotional strain in silence only deepens the wound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What men need is understanding and encouragement to redefine masculinity so that they feel safe enough to open up to others. They need to believe that taking care of others doesn’t mean neglecting themselves and that choosing emotional honesty is not a sign of weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Stimulating either of a pair of crucial nerves that carry messages from the brain to several major organs could be an effective way to treat people with severe  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="158509" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers conducted a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="158509" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; on 493 adults whose major depression hadn't previously &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/treatment-for-depression-changes-the-very-structure-of-the-brain-scientists-find"&gt;responded to treatment&lt;/a&gt;. Participants were fitted with a device capable of stimulating one of their vagus nerves, which was then activated in half the group to transmit signals to areas of their brain that regulate moods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessments were carried out for roughly ten months, after which participants who received the stimulation treatment showed improvements in their &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007"&gt;depressive symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, in their quality of life, and in their ability to carry out the daily tasks of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_147563" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147563" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/VagusNerve.jpg" alt="Vagus nerves" class="wp-image-147563 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/VagusNerve.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/VagusNerve-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-147563" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;There are left and right vagus nerves in our bodies. (Benote/iStock/Getty Images Plus)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On average, each patient had already tried 13 treatments that failed to help them before they enrolled in the trial, and they had spent more than half of their lives sick with depression," &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/vagus-nerve-stimulation-relieves-severe-depression/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Charles Conway, a professor of psychiatry at Washington University in St Louis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But despite that super-high level of sustained illness, we still see  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="158509" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt;, measurable improvements in depressive symptoms, quality of life and functional outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While VNS &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/vagus-nerve-stimulation-relieves-severe-depression/"&gt;has shown&lt;/a&gt; promise for treating depression before, evidence of its success &lt;a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(05)00620-7/abstract"&gt;hasn't always&lt;/a&gt; been clear cut, leaving treatment difficult to afford for many in the US on insurance cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some reasons to be cautious. Based on the study's primary measure of depressive symptoms, the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), there were no differences between the treatment and non-treatment groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very few participants from either group reported a full remission in their depression, and it's also worth noting the study was partly funded and supported by LivaNova USA, which manufactures a VNS therapy system for patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with those caveats in mind though, the study's results are promising, particularly when it comes to helping people escape the mental paralysis that can come along with major depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158511" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158511" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DepressedManLyingDown.jpg" alt="Vagus Nerve Stimulation Shows Lasting Effects in People With Severe Depression" class="size-full wp-image-158511" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DepressedManLyingDown.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DepressedManLyingDown-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DepressedManLyingDown-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158511" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mental paralysis can occur with major depression. (Marjan_Apostolovic/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's really important here is that patients themselves were reporting that their lives were improving," &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/vagus-nerve-stimulation-relieves-severe-depression/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Conway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They're saying they are seeing meaningful improvements in their ability to function and live their lives."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.21120"&gt;Up to 30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of those with severe depression fail to benefit from standard antidepressants, with their mental health problems compounded by an increased risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032717324096"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/impact-treatment-resistant-depression-health-care/"&gt;hospitalization&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.21120"&gt;disability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145981" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145981" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/TakingAPillWithWater642.jpg" alt="A women takes a pill" class="wp-image-145981 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/TakingAPillWithWater642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/TakingAPillWithWater642-530x415.jpg 530w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/TakingAPillWithWater642-600x470.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145981" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Up to 30 percent of those with severe depression fail to benefit from standard antidepressants.

In addition, the researchers want to continue the trial for another four years, and see if the benefits are particularly noticeable in certain groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The nice thing about vagus nerve stimulation, we know from other studies, is that when the patient responds, the effects usually stick," &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/vagus-nerve-stimulation-relieves-severe-depression/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Conway.&lt;/p&gt;

												&lt;p&gt;Ryo Tatsuki, a Japanese manga artist known as “Japan’s Baba Vanga,” gained attention for predicting the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in her 1999 comic The Future As I See It.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wrote about an unknown virus emerging around 2020, reaching its peak in April. This prediction closely matched the real outbreak that began in late 2019 and peaked with deadly waves in the following years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same comic, Tatsuki warned that the virus would disappear but return about ten years later, suggesting a possible comeback around 2030. As this year approaches, her forecast is being discussed again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though not confirmed by science, the comic has stirred curiosity, especially as experts remain alert to new health threats around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Tatsuki receives her visions through dreams, health experts are focused on real risks like “Disease X,” H5N1 bird flu, and other global viruses. Preparations for future pandemics are already underway.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When speech pathologist Vanessa Abraham began to feel ill in 2019, she thought she had a bad case of the flu. She was exhausted and her body ached. Her voice was raspy. She was prescribed antibiotics, but they didn't help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week later, Abraham woke up in the middle of the night and tried to stand. She collapsed to the floor, struggling to breathe. Her husband took her to an area hospital, where Abraham was taken to the ICU and intubated. The ventilator helped her breathe but left her unable to speak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors didn't know what was causing her symptoms. Two days after being admitted, she was transferred to UC San Diego Health, a larger hospital. That's where she met Dr. Jared Rosen, then a medical student on an ICU rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Abraham was in the ICU, doctors suggested multiple diagnoses, but none fit. Even scarier than the lack of answers was her continued intubation. She was unable to speak or eat. She was fighting paralysis that left her unable to move much of her body. Her neck was so weak that she couldn't raise her head without it flopping like a newborn baby's, Rosen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I was very aware of what was going on," Abraham told CBS News. "It was beyond the worst experience I could have ever imagined myself being in."&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham said the only thing that helped relieve her anxiety during this time was the long hours Rosen would spend at her bedside, doing his best to keep her spirits up. As a medical student, he had fewer responsibilities than other members of her care team and was able to spend more time with Abraham. They also worked to develop communication methods Abraham could use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After several weeks, Abraham's symptoms began to improve. She was taken off the ventilator. After a month, she was released from the ICU. But doctors were still no closer to understanding what had caused her paralysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no official label or term for what I was having. The fear of not knowing was terrifying," Abraham said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diagnosing a rare form of an unusual condition &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being discharged from the ICU, Abraham still had weakness that left her unable to lift her right arm and made eating difficult, so she spent time in inpatient physical therapy. Even after that, she needed outpatient follow-up, as well as more specialized care like swallowing and voice therapy. She battled severe anxiety and depression. At times, she felt so overwhelmed that she considered taking her own life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;
    
                                    
      &lt;span class="img embed__content"&gt;&lt;img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/04/18/8df396ab-07d5-4bb3-a59f-bd82e7288719/thumbnail/1240x930/b7de61408d0c723b1095ddba34d777b4/vanessa-rehab-2.png?v=04a4ba26f526ed8207f014fe1018c4aa#" alt="vanessa-rehab-2.png " loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                Vanessa Abraham

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night, she searched for Rosen online and found his email address. Abraham wrote and asked if he remembered her. When he responded and said that he did, it "brought tears" to her eyes and "sparked some level of joy" that helped her have hope. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That hope carried her through the next several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, four months after her symptoms began, Abraham was diagnosed with a form of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare neurological disorder where the fibers around the nerves deteriorate and cause paralysis. In most cases, the paralysis starts in the legs and works its way upwards, according to Dr. Kiril Kiprovski, a neurologist and director of the Division of Neuromuscular Medicine at NYU Langone. Abraham had contracted the condition's even rarer pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant, which attacks the muscles in the diaphragm and throat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The variant is "very difficult to diagnose," Kiprovski said. There's no one test to determine if a person has Guillain-Barré syndrome or any of its variants, so doctors rely on clinical presentations. But they may not be familiar with the condition, Kiprovski said, because of its rarity. One person per 78,000 is diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome annually, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15838-guillain-barre-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Only about 3% of those patients are diagnosed with the pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant, researchers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6472218/#ref2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome or a variant of it tend to improve on their own, as Abraham did, Kiprovski said. Once Abraham was diagnosed, she was able to start receiving intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, where donor antibodies are given to a patient to strengthen their immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"It takes time"  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abraham continued her slow recovery. Having a name for what was happening to her helped her accept the laborious process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had to accept in my own head that this is going to be something that's just going to take time," Abraham said. "And that's how neuro diseases work. It takes time for your body to regenerate and heal." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;
    
                                    
      &lt;span class="img embed__content"&gt;&lt;img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/04/18/357cf7aa-2c79-4253-8c15-64698ad1d03a/thumbnail/1240x1860/298334ca89e568c39b7e2b3925b7f242/vanessa.jpg?v=04a4ba26f526ed8207f014fe1018c4aa#" alt="vanessa.jpg " loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years later, Abraham still has neuromuscular weakness, but can go about much more of her daily routine. She is back at work, where her voiceless experience in the ICU informs her interactions with patients whose speech has been compromised. She spends as much time as possible in the gym, working to strengthen her body. She also stayed in touch with Rosen, who is now finishing a fellowship in critical care medicine at the University of California's Davis Medical Center. He told CBS News that Abraham's case inspired him to study that area of medicine. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham's recovery hasn't just been physical. She started attending a support group for people who have trauma after time in the ICU. The experience has helped her recover from the fear of those weeks on a ventilator. She has worked to raise awareness for the benefits of such groups. She also wrote a memoir detailing her experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's so much more to recovery than just getting strong again," Abraham said. &lt;/p&gt;

She did. “It just came out of nowhere,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3QYDKWNEQZGYVL6QAUUSXKHDKA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Rhoton, now 43, a software marketer in Boston, went to an ear, nose and throat specialist who told him he had a deviated septum, a common condition when the cartilage and the septum — the bone partition separating the nostrils — is “off center.” He recommended corrective surgery, and Rhoton agreed. The doctor also suggested a second procedure at the same time, a near-total removal of a turbinate in each nostril. Turbinates are small structures — three on each side — that cleanse, warm and humidify the air when it is drawn into the nose. But they can become inflamed and enlarged — the case with Rhoton — and doctors sometimes reduce or remove them to improve breathing when sprays and other measures are ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NAV4NPTVJZE23KLQP35J4AUV2U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The doctor told Rhoton that the surgery was routine and low-risk. He had no idea that instead of breathing better, the opposite would occur, prompting life-altering symptoms — constant nasal congestion, sleep disturbances, crushing fatigue and brain fog, anxiety, and weight gain. It took nearly six years and visits to 17 doctors, some of whom told him he was imagining things, before one of them finally identified the problem and offered a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5C4PJF3JP5GKHLC2ARV73SD4LE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“My symptoms made daily life a struggle simply to function,” he says. “It’s hard to believe that it took so many doctors and so much time to figure this out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-heMhiJ-isCenteredLayout-true" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="DF5Z5VPWEZCZ5BKWHNKEHDLBOY" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="DF5Z5VPWEZCZ5BKWHNKEHDLBOY"&gt;Congestion, burning and no sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WQBSSZVQDFAL3PMTIRR4TLPTAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Rhoton’s initial surgery took place in April 2018. The doctor corrected the septum and removed most of the “inferior” turbinate — the largest of the three — from each nostril. &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-treatments/n/nasal-surgery/types/turbinate-reduction.html#:~:text=Turbinates%20are%20small%20structures%20inside%20the%20nose,passes%20through%20the%20nostrils%20into%20the%20lungs."&gt;Turbinate reduction&lt;/a&gt; is a common  procedure used to improve airflow, with a success rate of 82 percent, according to the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3XSBUENOKVDSJHRMYBIQ2NA6YY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Over the course of three months, Rhoton developed a worsening cascade of symptoms. He felt like he could no longer breathe through his nose. His nasal passages became congested and crusted, with a nagging burning sensation. “I felt like I was suffocating,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M6Y4AEQDLNAI7PNBUKHYF7KW3E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He had to breathe through his mouth, almost like he had a persistent cold that wouldn’t go away. He couldn’t sleep and became extremely sleepy during the day. The constant fatigue left him with no energy or motivation. He became anxious and started eating junk food. He gained weight. And, to his frustration, the whistling resumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body grid-body grid-center" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-testid="quote" class="wpds-c-hqmxme wpds-c-hqmxme-fDUVQq-showBorder-true wpds-c-hqmxme-iPJLV-css article-quote relative border-box font-light black font--headline mr-lg-mod-ns"&gt;&lt;p data-contentid="TGXPV5MW2NBIFOCIIWH3VRPM5Y" data-apitype="text" data-qa="article-quote" class="wpds-c-PJLV"&gt;“I felt like I was suffocating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="wpds-c-jFMeKj"&gt;— Bradley Rhoton&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="62Y3FZ4H55BLVKMURBTY22WWX4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most distressingly, he felt too tired to play with his sons, now 5 and 2. “It was like I was on a two-hour battery,” he says. “I wanted to do fun things with my kids, but I was so diminished that I couldn’t care for them. I’d fall asleep in the lawn chair while I was supposed to be watching them play outside.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WM5OYPVNYVAPVMFEVGCUYFGV44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He’d never had sleeping problems, but now he’d nod off during work because he couldn’t sleep at night. “I’d be on a call and fall asleep,” he says. “The person on the other end of the phone would ask: ‘Bradley, are you there?’ and I played it like it was a poor connection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HQXOWRJAOFGV5P6JVLPMLCMOW4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He tried nasal sprays and other decongestants, saline irrigation, allergy medications, and antihistamines. None worked. He returned to the ENT doctor in October, who found a small hole in his septum, which he repaired, but Rhoton’s symptoms did not improve. In May, he had a small benign growth removed from one of his nostrils. That didn’t help, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Q45PVMGNQRCTBJGCO6NKK623OM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Frustrated, over the next 18 months he sought help from other doctors, including his primary care physician and two new ENT specialists. “They told me my nose looked fine,” he says. “They said: ‘Your nose is wide open. Straight. Healed. There’s nothing wrong with you.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-heMhiJ-isCenteredLayout-true" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="FVN2G7PTNNCMPBVP5YSEEK3IRI" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="FVN2G7PTNNCMPBVP5YSEEK3IRI"&gt;All in his head, sleep apnea?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TSR3KPXMRBCH5GASXUQF2RQIJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He began to wonder if some of the specialists he’d seen were right that “it was all in my head,” even though he’d expected the original surgery to go well and was surprised by the ensuing symptoms. He found it vexing that no one took his symptoms seriously. “It was an upsetting journey that raised questions about how the health-care system responds and the often overlooked psychological toll of being medically misunderstood,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3A7YAE6MIJG4DOVRK6ER6QCUQY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Rhoton considered the possibility that his breathing problems — which at times were so bad that he couldn’t go out with friends, exercise or engage in his favorite hobbies, such as photography or playing hockey — actually might be unrelated to his nose and the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WGDPQGC7DFD3BGTXQLHR2TZ6IE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He saw a sleep specialist, thinking perhaps a sleep disorder was causing his disrupted sleep. The doctor diagnosed him with mild &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; and recommended  a &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/cpap#What-is-CPAP?"&gt;CPAP machine&lt;/a&gt;, which helps keep a person’s airways open, at night. He tried  but couldn’t stick with it because wearing a mask over his nose and mouth exacerbated his symptoms, and he felt like he was gasping for air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body grid-body grid-center" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-testid="quote" class="wpds-c-hqmxme wpds-c-hqmxme-fDUVQq-showBorder-true wpds-c-hqmxme-iPJLV-css article-quote relative border-box font-light black font--headline mr-lg-mod-ns"&gt;&lt;p data-contentid="F2ULMDD7ZBG63HOHZ3GMNUMOHY" data-apitype="text" data-qa="article-quote" class="wpds-c-PJLV"&gt;“It can be incredibly impactful to their well-being, their quality of life, including to their mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="wpds-c-jFMeKj"&gt;— Pryor Brenner, Washington, D.C., otolaryngologist &lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="23NCTBQCPBHLLOXGMGIPEHFGNI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He then went to a cardiologist, who gave him a stress test and drew blood for lab work.

Das said he could not diagnose  Rhoton from afar, but the two discussed several possibilities, including a rare and debilitating disorder that sometimes occurs after turbinate surgery: “&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23170-empty-nose-syndrome"&gt;empty nose syndrome&lt;/a&gt;,” in which patients develop relentless and severe nasal congestion and significantly restricted breathing through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H34RV7CSVFBLPNBUAG6HFLLB2Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;ENS is not a well-understood disorder and is a somewhat controversial diagnosis because of its counterintuitive nature, since turbinate surgery is meant to improve breathing, not make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AHM2EVSUTNF57MNCLPXZEAWCWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s unclear why some patients experience breathing problems following turbinate surgery, while most do not. Some experts think that anatomical differences among patients may play a role. Regardless, “it’s real,” says Pryor Brenner, a D.C. otolaryngologist who has seen only two ENS cases in 24 years among the more than 2,000 nasal surgeries he’s performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3HJSVVEC55EDPPI4WVZZ2ZZ7ZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I discuss the possibility of ENS with all my patients because it’s a major medical problem when it does occur,” he adds. “It can be incredibly impactful to their well-being, their quality of life, including to their mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SCRPLMLXTZE5RMOPMGUDGPIMQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some experts believe that ENS results from the loss during surgery of important turbinate tissue receptors that signal normal airflow. With key receptors gone, some “patients feel like they can’t breathe,” says Eugene Kern, clinical professor in the department of otolaryngology, head and neck surgery at the State University of New York at Buffalo. “They have to breathe through the mouth. You no longer get the feeling of normal breathing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BXJ34UFKKJCXBEU36YRTZOR2JM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kern identified the syndrome with a colleague in 1994 while working at the Mayo Clinic  and coined the name. He believes ENS occurs more frequently than known, although there are no reliable estimates available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3HH4Z6IOA5FRFN54GXD3KIPSSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While at Mayo, Kern treated nearly 250 ENS patients, all of whom had undergone turbinate surgery elsewhere. “I was seeing four or five patients a week,” Kern says, adding that it goes undiagnosed because many doctors “don’t understand the mechanism. It’s easy to diagnose when you know what you are looking for. You can’t miss it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-heMhiJ-isCenteredLayout-true" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="HADLCSL3YNHLHOJQU4NB6327XQ" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="HADLCSL3YNHLHOJQU4NB6327XQ"&gt;A reason for hope&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5HKNDBFHHVD6TLWZAIVMIHPNYQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After talking with Das, Rhoton felt certain he was suffering from ENS. “Suddenly it all made sense,” he recalls. Das suggested Rhoton contact Jayakar Nayak, an ENT surgeon at Stanford University, who was using several effective novel treatment approaches and was also in Rhoton’s health insurance network. Nayak had published research articles on the condition and had a podcast about ENS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BQ7WPQDGJFBSRCNJOGPG55RVFU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This provided me with something I hadn’t felt in years,” Rhoton says. “Hope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y4FHQZRF65F4LFVQJDW7CJMWHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nayak, an expert in nasal and sinus disorders, says he has performed thousands of inferior turbinate reduction surgeries for nasal congestion over the years with no ill aftereffects, but acknowledges that problems can occur sporadically, making a diagnosis perplexing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4LAM6QVT4FFWBIXUZFQSFUFBDY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Inferior turbinate reduction for abnormally enlarged and obstructing turbinate tissue is a remarkably safe and effective procedure to help patients to breathe and sleep better,” he says, and unfortunately “we don’t know why ENS happens in a small group of people and not in others. I’ve seen similar levels of tissue loss in other patients who don’t have any ENS symptoms and are so happy with their breathing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SBMBWS3TKJHMVB7A4MXBI4L4CU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He also has received hundreds of referrals over the years to evaluate symptomatic patients for ENS, but only a fraction turn out to have the disorder, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="66UMDVMDMBCZDLG52A2JBFRKVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In Rhoton’s case, because his symptoms occurred right after the surgery, ENS was a likely diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R5NKNXWTXJFORGLJMSW6UKDGDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To confirm this, Nayak ran a series of tests when Rhoton came to see him last June. “We have a scoring system that lists the common symptoms of ENS with a maximum score of 30, with 30 being the worst,” Nayak recalls. “Bradley’s score was 26.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BF3OAWVVIJADVHGN2HF2HYVWYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The doctor performed a second diagnostic test by inserting cotton into various areas of Rhoton’s nose. When the cotton was placed in nostril areas where tissue was missing, “he was breathing like a normal person. He went from 26 to 2 on the scoring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YOIO77FWC5FLPL4IOJJP4FM6BY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nayak recalls that Rhoton “was so pleased, he was almost crying.

I finally can breathe through my nose again.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A752FGIYLRBBNFQJL3A7KVRU6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The next step was a series of injections — four or five in each nostril — with a gel made of carboxymethyl cellulose, a filler used in many pharmaceutical products. Although the temporary filler does not restore lost nerves and receptors or last forever, it improves airflow. A permanent solution for those who appear to be good candidates is surgery to implant rib cartilage (sanitized and irradiated material taken from cadaver sources) into nasal passages to replace missing turbinate tissue. While not a complete cure, it significantly reduces symptoms, Nayak’s research found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QC66HHKPKZE3TMISHD2X6NYMYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Last September, Rhoton got the injections and improved substantially in the month that followed. “I could breathe through my nose. I could sleep. My mood improved. I felt motivated,” he says. “The difference was amazing.” He has had a follow-up series of injections when his breathing worsened again and is now leaning toward having the surgery, probably in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="73JESQUQGRBF7PYALGQGV7UHNU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And, he says, “I’m hopeful for the first time in nearly six years.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;If you feel like your seasonal allergies are getting worse every year, it's not just you. Warming from climate change is making the pollen season longer, and more people are going to the doctor each year looking for relief, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/lary.32124" target="_blank"&gt;research review&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;The Laryngoscope. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One study the reviewers looked at found the pollen season had already gotten 20 days longer in North America between 1990 and 2018, and several studies found an increase in average daily pollen concentrations. &lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are ways to keep the pollen from taking over your life. NPR asked doctors for tips to help you manage your spring allergies before they manage you.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story comes from NPR's &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/health" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Want more stories on the science of healthy living? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/health" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Keep the outside outside &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pollen can be carried in on just about any surface, warns Dr. Zachary Rubin a pediatric allergist and clinical immunologist who &lt;a href="https://drrubin.substack.com/" target="_blank"&gt;blogs about allergies&lt;/a&gt; and shares &lt;a href="https://linktr.ee/rubin_allergy?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAadZB16VfI48t4rNxPpq8LGfLlXSPCFs_gMO_ZloFK_Ods47Z08uMw6zELxkSw_aem_BhmrDvthdrUr_RrI6aDFBA" target="_blank"&gt;allergy-related tips on social media&lt;/a&gt;. Taking your shoes off and storing them in a closet or foyer is a good start, but there's more.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When you come home, "before you sit down on furniture or in your bed, you ideally should take off any clothes that would have been touching the outside world," Rubin says. Socks, pants, shirts all go directly in your laundry. Rubin also recommends taking a shower or a bath before bed to rinse pollen from your skin and hair.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When indoors, Rubin recommends keeping your windows and doors closed as much as possible. That may be a bummer if you love a spring breeze, but you're inviting pollen and mold into your house whenever you open the windows, says Rubin.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;If you're allergic to pollen, the stuff is more likely to float through windows on a dry and windy day. Rubin says rainy days are good for flushing pollen out of the air. But if you're allergic to mold, it's better to keep windows shut on rainy days too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you've just got to open those windows, Rubin says an indoor air purifier can provide some relief.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;2. Wipe down or bathe your pets&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you have a dog, cat or any pet who spends time outside, wipe the animal off whenever they come inside, says Rubin. You can pick up allergy-friendly wipes at pet stores. It's also worth giving pets more frequent baths to remove pollen, says Dr. Neelima Tummala, an ENT physician and clinical assistant professor in otolaryngology at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Keep your nose clean&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;First, look at when pollen counts are really high and try to avoid being outdoors during those times of day, advises Tummala. Right now we're in tree pollen season … and tree pollen tends to be highest in the mornings, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; Want to enjoy nature with fewer sneezes? It turns out the masks we got used to wearing to prevent COVID transmission "can be very helpful actually," says Rubin, when it comes to keeping out pollen and mold. He points to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7467086/" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; where health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic reported reduced allergy symptoms when they were wearing masks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's also a good idea to rinse out your nose when you get home, says Rubin. You can do that with a neti pot or a saline spray. If you go the neti pot route, be sure to use distilled water, or tap water that's been boiled and cooled down, Rubin cautions. (Water straight from the tap comes with a small risk of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/03/1160980794/neti-pot-safety-brain-eating-amoeba" target="_blank"&gt;sending an amoeba to eat your brain&lt;/a&gt; – eek!)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Know your meds and when to use what&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Different allergy medications treat different symptoms. Here are a few common ones, and what to know about how to use them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral and nasal antihistamines&lt;/strong&gt;. If you're experiencing itchy eyes, a runny nose, or sneezing, an oral antihistamine like Zyrtec, Claritin, or Allegra should help, Rubin says. Astepro is a nasal spray with antihistamine, which Rubin usually recommends pairing with a steroid spray. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steroid nasal sprays. &lt;/strong&gt;If you've got congestion or postnasal drip, that's where nasal sprays come in. Examples of common steroid sprays are Flonase, Nasacort and Nasonex.  However, "We don't always tell people to take [steroid sprays] year-round," says Rubin. So check with your physician about how long you should be using it. Nasal steroid sprays take a few weeks to kick in, notes Tummala. With pollen season starting earlier, "you may need to start your intranasal steroid spray earlier than you used to," so they'll be optimally effective, she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nasal decongestants&lt;/strong&gt;. If you're really stuffed up and need instant relief,  you may want to try  a nasal decongestant spray like Afrin or Vicks Sinex, Rubin says.  These sprays shrink the blood vessels in your nasal passages. But Rubin cautions against using them for more than 3 to 5 days at a time, because after you stop, you can develop a rebound nasal congestion that gets progressively worse. "You almost become dependent upon it and it's hard to get rid of," he warns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Nasal spray the right way &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;You're probably doing it wrong. I know I was. "A lot of people just naturally go&lt;em&gt;, snort, spray, snort&lt;/em&gt;. What that does is it just shoots the medicine to the back of your throat where you taste it. And if you taste it, you waste it," Rubin says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rubin_allergy/video/7219482513071148331" target="_blank"&gt;demonstrated how to use nasal spray properly&lt;/a&gt; in a TikTok that went viral. Here's his secret to getting it right:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;I tell people 'nose to toes.' So you look down and then you place the nozzle up, but then you tilt it slightly towards the ear on the same side as your nostril. And after you spray on each side, you look forward and breathe through your mouth. Breathe normally, maybe a slight inhalation through your nose, but you never snort it," Rubin advises.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Why aim towards the ear? The ear is connected to the back of the throat and nasal cavity through the eustachian tube, so decreasing inflammation in that area will lower the risk of getting fluid behind your ear. Pointing the spray bottle towards the ear also targets openings between your nasal passages and your sinuses, lowering your risk of developing a sinus infection, says Rubin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Be aware of factors that can worsen your allergic reaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rubin uses a concept called &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHjNoY8RLE0/" target="_blank"&gt;the allergy symptom threshold&lt;/a&gt; to explain how exposure to multiple allergens, along with other factors, can trigger symptoms.  "You could be exposed to one pollen grain and not sneeze, but if you're exposed to a thousand, you're going to sneeze because there's enough there that will activate the immune system," he explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That goes for different kinds of allergens too. For instance, last week I was in Washington D.C., contending with pollen from the lovely cherry blossoms outside, and my sister's cat Felicia indoors. My sinuses were not pleased.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It's like you have a cup and you're filling it with different allergens and exposures, says Rubin." (He &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHjNoY8RLE0/" target="_blank"&gt;illustrates the concept&lt;/a&gt; in another video.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other factors can also increase your likelihood of having an allergic reaction. For some people Rubin says, drinking alcohol lowers the threshold, and some are more vulnerable when they exercise, particularly outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you happen to be sick, "your immune system is aggravated and hyperactive," Rubin says, and more likely to respond to allergens. (It can also work the other way around – if mucus builds up in your sinuses because of allergies and you're less able to fend off a respiratory infection that comes your way, he says.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It goes back to reducing exposure, says Rubin: The more you can cut back your exposures to all kinds of allergens and irritants, the more successful you'll be at preventing an allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR's Maria Godoy contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Young adults who scored higher on right-wing authoritarianism had less gray matter volume in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, a region involved in social reasoning. Meanwhile, those who endorsed more extreme forms of left-wing authoritarianism showed reduced cortical thickness in the right anterior insula, a brain area tied to empathy and emotion regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research aimed to better understand the brain-based traits that might underlie authoritarian thinking. Previous studies have documented the psychological characteristics associated with authoritarianism—such as impulsivity, dogmatism, and heightened sensitivity to threat—but few have examined whether these traits are reflected in brain structure. The authors were particularly interested in both left- and right-wing authoritarianism, as research has increasingly recognized that rigid, anti-democratic attitudes can be found at both ends of the political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research on ideological authoritarianism and other forms of radical political attitudes has been attracting growing attention,” said study author Jesús Adrián-Ventura, a professor at University of Zaragoza and member of &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pseudo-lab/home?authuser=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Pseudo-Lab Research Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, despite increasing reports on its psychological correlates, its integration with neurobiological data remains very limited, in particular regarding left-wing authoritarianism, which remains poorly represented in the current psychological literature. This led us to undertake a study on authoritarianism from a neuroscientific perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate these questions, the researchers recruited 100 young adults in Spain, mostly university students between the ages of 18 and 30. Each participant completed a series of psychological questionnaires that measured political orientation, authoritarian beliefs, impulsivity, anxiety, and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers used updated scales that assess both &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_authoritarianism"&gt;traditional right-wing authoritarianism&lt;/a&gt; and a recently developed &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/large-study-indicates-left-wing-authoritarianism-exists-and-is-a-key-predictor-of-psychological-and-behavioral-outcomes/"&gt;measure of left-wing authoritarianism&lt;/a&gt;, which includes dimensions like anti-hierarchical aggression and top-down censorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using a high-resolution 3T scanner. The researchers focused on two structural features of the brain: gray matter volume, which reflects the density of neurons and connections in different brain regions, and cortical thickness, a measure of the depth of the brain’s outer layer. They used whole-brain statistical analyses to identify whether either of these features was associated with authoritarian beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, the results supported previous findings that people with authoritarian attitudes, regardless of political orientation, tend to act impulsively in emotionally charged situations. Both left-wing and right-wing authoritarians scored higher on “negative urgency,” a trait linked to impulsive actions under distress. However, left-wing authoritarianism—especially the tendency toward aggressive anti-establishment views—was also linked to higher levels of trait anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both left-wing and right-wing authoritarians act impulsively in emotionally negative situations, while the former tend to be more anxious,” Adrián-Ventura told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the neural level, the researchers found two key structural associations. First, higher scores on right-wing authoritarianism were related to smaller gray matter volume in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. This region is known to be involved in understanding others’ perspectives, making moral judgments, and navigating complex social situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Right-wing authoritarianism is associated with a lower dorsomedial prefrontal cortex gray matter volume, a region involved in understanding others’ thoughts and perspectives,” Adrián-Ventura said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have linked activity in this region to political decision-making and reactions to conflicting information. The authors suggest that reduced volume in this area might reflect more rigid thinking styles or difficulties with cognitive flexibility among right-wing authoritarians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, individuals who scored high on the anti-hierarchical aggression component of left-wing authoritarianism showed lower cortical thickness in the right anterior insula. Interestingly, the same region has been implicated in studies examining reactions to political disagreement and emotional responses to moral violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reduced cortical thickness in the right anterior insula—a region associated with emotional empathy and behavioral inhibition—is linked to increased anti-hierarchical aggressive attitudes (i.e., the preference for violent actions and punishment against perceived authority structures) in the context of left-wing authoritarianism,” Adrián-Ventura explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These neurobiological results were very surprising. Due to the lack of prior studies, our approach was mainly exploratory and data-driven. Still, it is quite difficult to obtain significant results in MR studies when strict statistical thresholds are applied. The obtained medium-to-large effect sizes are therefore striking and demand further scrutiny.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further validate their findings, the researchers examined whether these brain differences were also associated with related political ideologies. The gray matter reductions in the prefrontal cortex correlated with higher scores on social dominance orientation, a belief system often linked to right-wing authoritarianism. Likewise, the thinning in the anterior insula was related to endorsement of radical feminist views, which share ideological ground with the anti-authority stance of left-wing authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study breaks new ground by identifying distinct neural correlates for both left-wing and right-wing authoritarianism, it is not without limitations. The sample was relatively homogenous, consisting mainly of young, educated individuals from a single European country. The findings may not generalize to older populations or to people in different cultural and political environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, new research would be needed to confirm and expand our results in different populations,” Adrián-Ventura noted. “This is particularly relevant in the domain of authoritarianism as this construct tends to manifest within a range of context-dependent determinants (i.e., salient forms of authoritarian attitudes in post-communist or Hispanic American countries, among others, often exhibit specific traits).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, because the study was cross-sectional, it cannot determine whether the brain differences cause authoritarian attitudes or result from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that authoritarian beliefs are not solely determined by brain anatomy. Instead, the structural differences may reflect long-standing cognitive and emotional patterns that interact with social and cultural influences. For example, people with a tendency to experience anxiety or act rashly under stress may be more drawn to authoritarian ideologies when they perceive the world as threatening or unstable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build on these findings by examining how these brain structures function during political decision-making or when people are confronted with opposing views. Longitudinal studies may also help clarify whether changes in political ideology are associated with structural or functional shifts in the brain over time. Experimental studies could test whether interventions targeting emotion regulation or perspective-taking influence authoritarian attitudes and their neural underpinnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are dedicated to the scientific study of radical beliefs (e.g., authoritarianism, pseudoscientific doctrines, conspiracy theories, and interventions such as empathetic refutation),” Adrián-Ventura told PsyPost. “In the context of authoritarianism, our goal is to delineate a precise network of psychological associations and its neurocognitive profile. To this end, we will integrate novel behavioral and neuroimaging data—by means of structural and functional MRI—together with new experimental designs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2025.04.027"&gt;Authoritarianism and the brain: Structural MR correlates associated with polarized left- and right-wing ideology traits&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jesús Adrián-Ventura, Diego Avendaño, Anna Miró-Padilla, Anastasia Cherednichenko, César Ávila, Angelo Fasce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 10:00:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQYlVJUXpaMk1qM0V6ZEtNbU43ZTdEa1NrS2hvUG5YTEp1X0xscF9lOXNndEpRQTlOZGUzYjJWbDZZM24zR1dKWmJCOTlTTUJwcUI1UlZxOElYN0FzOFEzalJoNkg1NFR4ZGV0ajc2ZXJCREFsV0FWQjRmWWJ3d2xVYmlIaENjV2RGNHhXRER4WkthNWJnbFhUU1hBaWZkcXlNUHZoVFBB</guid></item><item><title>尊敬的Annie ：有控制欲和可疑倾向的丈夫应该接受痴呆症检测- MLive.com | Dear Annie: Husband who turned controlling and suspicious should be tested for dementia - MLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IWBUK2HZCRB4BPBP2NX4Z6XCOI"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear Annie: &lt;/b&gt;It might be worthwhile for “Help Me,” whose husband has become increasingly controlling and preoccupied with her whereabouts, to have him assessed for dementia or another medical disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZCDTWX7JFJBWFPFNVUSRUZAYRI"&gt; Dementia can sometimes present in such a fashion, with increasing hostility, suspicion and misplaced blame often toward a spouse.

                                        Estimated read time: 3-4
                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SARATOGA SPRINGS — Intermountain Health on Friday broke ground on the site of its new multi-specialty clinic, which will include a dedicated cancer center, for residents of northern Utah County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Intermountain Saratoga Springs Multi-Specialty Clinic and Cancer Center plans to offer a wide range of specialized services, including OB/GYN care, gastroenterology care, audiology, urology, cardiology and pediatrics services, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancer center within the clinic will provide comprehensive cancer care, such as chemotherapy treatments and support services. This will include survivorship services like oncology social work and &lt;a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/cancer-care/aya" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;oncology nurse navigators&lt;/a&gt;, who guide patients through the health care system and help manage expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new cancer center will join only two others in the county — located in American Fork and Provo — in hopes of easing the burden on patients who would otherwise need to regularly travel around 20 to 50 miles round trip to receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Intermountain has a very strong belief that cancer care should be delivered close to home," said Desiree Dougherty, assistant regional service line director for Intermountain Health. "Carrying the burden of cancer ... is time consuming, creates stress, anxiety, time away from work, and they all have to spend hours in centers on days that they feel awful. The care is hard, and the treatments are difficult. So bringing cancer care close to home for these patients is incredibly important so they can have the care that they need with their families close to home."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laurie and Scott Stone felt the full weight of this burden when Laurie was diagnosed with uterine cancer in 2022. She went through extensive testing and was advised to have a hysterectomy. Following her procedure, doctors determined she would also need radiation therapy, which she received at the Intermountain cancer centers in American Fork and Provo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This required frequent 25- or 50-mile trips, typically during heavy morning traffic. Two years after Laurie Stone's diagnosis, Scott received abnormal blood test results at his yearly physical and was also diagnosed with cancer. Laurie Stone has now completed treatment and anxiously awaits the five-year mark, where she will be declared cancer free, and Scott Stone is still undergoing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair were present at Friday's groundbreaking ceremony and expressed their deep gratitude and love for the medical staff in Intermountain's oncology network who have supported them over the years. While they will still need to travel for the remainder of Scott Stone's treatment, the couple is excited that these services will be available just 5 miles from their home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm so grateful for this center being here closer to home and that our community can take advantage of (it). Thank you very much," said Scott Stone, addressing Intermountain staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multidisciplinary clinic aims to provide more services to northern Utah County because it is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51012325/these-were-utahs-fastest-growing-cities-in-2023--and-the-cities-that-lost-population" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;fastest-growing areas&lt;/a&gt; in the state. Saratoga Springs is home to over 59,000 residents as of 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.saratogasprings-ut.gov/DocumentCenter/View/14460/24-25-Citizens-Budget" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;almost doubling&lt;/a&gt; its population since 2018. Eagle Mountain has around 64,000 residents and &lt;a href="https://eaglemountain.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EagleMountainCityUT_Demos_2024.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;is projected to grow&lt;/a&gt; to nearly 80,000 by 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our vision for this clinic is simple, which is that we want to bring the full strength of Intermountain cancer services into a space that feels local, personal and healing," said Brandon Barney, medical director of radiation oncology services. "Patients here will have access to the same cutting edge technology that they would get in Salt Lake or at Utah Valley Hospital. That includes treatments with radiotherapy, with chemotherapy ... in-office procedures, radiation treatment planning. There's not really going to be a disease site or a type of cancer that we won't be able to treat here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinic will be located at 392 W.

&lt;p&gt;We rarely think about food in relation to our mental health. We worry about it leading to health issues, such as &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/worst-foods-for-heart-health_l_63e51cdfe4b0255caae9f325" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681"&gt;cardiovascular&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/worst-foods-for-digestion-health_l_6411d77ce4b0a3902d2e1014" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681"&gt;gastrointestinal&lt;/a&gt; problems, but did you know that different foods and beverages can exacerbate anxiety spikes and even bouts of depression? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are foods and drinks that therapists and psychiatrists, who have spent their careers advising people on mental wellness, typically avoid ― or consume in moderation ― for the sake of their mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take this knowledge with a grain of salt. These foods and drinks can be consumed once in a while and not be correlated with negative mental health consequences. Just remember that, as with everything, moderation is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Cups Of Coffee Or Espresso&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, too much caffeine can have a negative impact on anxiety. “If a person is prone to feeling anxious or has multiple stressors, know that over-caffeination causes an increased cortisol response and can lead to adrenal fatigue, a recipe for persistent stress and burnout, not to mention sleep issues,” said licensed clinical psychologist &lt;a href="https://linkedin-learning.pxf.io/c/2706071/449670/8005?subId1=64667c76e4b035573934d585&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fdrbrittneyjones%2F" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Brittney Jones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4668773/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that consuming more than 250 milligrams of caffeine per day (that’s roughly 2 1/2 cups) could have a negative impact on anxiety, so Jones does her best to keep her coffee consumption under that amount. And for people who get jitters or anxiety spikes from coffee, consuming caffeine in the form of matcha can be a great alternative since it gives many people a feeling of calm alertness &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28056735/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;thanks to a compound called L-theanine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet Soda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking out for your mental health this summer, you might want to keep your diet soda consumption to a minimum. “Everyone loves a cold diet soda on a warm summer day, but the health concerns outweigh the benefits,” said &lt;a href="https://www.sohomd.com/psychiatrist-dr-jospitre" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Jacques Jospitre, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified psychiatrist and co-founder of SohoMD. “While we know high-sugar sodas aren’t great for our health, diet sodas might actually be even worse. Many of these contain phenylalanine, which is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28198207/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;an added chemical well-known to mess up brain neurochemistry&lt;/a&gt; by stopping the proper production of serotonin and dopamine, two molecules we need for good mood.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these drinks have artificial sweeteners like aspartame, “which is a known neurotoxin and &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1028415X.2017.1288340#:~:text=Aspartame%20acts%20as%20a%20chemical,adverse%20effects%20on%20neurobehavioral%20health." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;may raise stress hormones like cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, as well as increase the amount of free radicals in the brain,” Jospitre said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a drink or two once in a while isn’t the worst thing, &lt;a href="https://www.livebettertherapysolutions.com/about" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Danielle Tucci&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed professional counselor and the founder of Live Better Therapy Solutions, said she does her best to avoid alcohol when considering her mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Outer Banks SPCA/Dare County Animal Shelter is alerting residents that it has received a number of calls in the past few weeks about sick raccoons with possible cases of Canine Distemper Virus (CDV), particularly from the Colington and Manteo areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-4f3d55a153daef79b4f5c1ef028b703a outer-mobile-content-one" id="outer-4f3d55a153daef79b4f5c1ef028b703a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SPCA is reminding people to keep their dogs on a leash and call the Dare County Animal Shelter at &lt;a href="tel:2524755620"&gt;252-475-5620&lt;/a&gt; if they have an encounter with a raccoon.&lt;span id="more-334564"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In North Carolina, CDV infects raccoons, red foxes, gray foxes, coyotes, weasels, otters, skunks, and mink. Symptoms in wildlife often include discharge from the eyes and nose, difficulty breathing, coughing, vomiting and thickening of the nose and footpads. Canine distemper can also have a neurologic phase that produces signs similar to rabies, which makes it difficult to distinguish between the two diseases without testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-9f8e21256ff63b525ea642e7026dee63 outer-mobile-content-top" id="outer-9f8e21256ff63b525ea642e7026dee63"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-9532a9d2bbc2e26a7fb2000fcdf7d6af outer-content-top" id="outer-9532a9d2bbc2e26a7fb2000fcdf7d6af"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDV can be transmitted to pets from wildlife if contact occurs, we’d recommend people keep pets on a leash and do not allow them to approach any wildlife species, especially if it is acting unusual. Keeping pets up to date with their vaccines is the best way to prevent disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Around 90% of unvaccinated close contacts contract the virus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montana health officials told Cowboy State Daily on Friday that all the people infected live in Gallatin County and are currently isolated at home. The five people are unvaccinated, or their vaccine status is unknown. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here’s how these infections came to light. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“On April 11, we received an initial notification regarding individuals who had been potentially exposed to measles, and then following the development of symptoms in those individuals testing was conducted at the Montana Public Health Laboratory and then those cases were officially confirmed yesterday on April 17,” said Gallatin City-County Health Officer Lori Christenson.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Christenson detailed how five people, children and adults from two households in Gallatin County, recently attended the same event out of state. Christenson said she could not identify the type of event or its exact location, but these five people were there together. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then around April 11, the five people were alerted by others who attended the event that they may have been exposed to measles. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“They did a great thing,” said Dr. Peter Bulger, infectious disease medical director at Bozeman Health and Gallatin City-County Health Department. They reported it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;First, the five infected people were seen by physicians via a telehealth visit to prevent further infections. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, in a scene reminiscent of the COVID-19 pandemic, they drove to Bozeman Health Deaconess Regional Medical Center, where medical professionals in protective gear took samples from them while they remained in their vehicle. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think flashback to the pandemic is like the phrase of the day today,” said Bulger. “I think everybody's feeling a little sort of some PTSD about this.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles Hot Zones? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the public health team in Gallatin County traced the movements of the five infected people, they pinpointed two businesses on U.S. Highway 191: North Coast Electric in Four Corners and Interwest Tire in Belgrade. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week, tire stores across Gallatin County are full of customers coming in to switch out their studded snow tires for summer tires. Anyone present at Interwest Tire between noon-4 p.m. on April 14 could have been exposed, according to public health officials. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Three days earlier on April 11, between 7:30-10:30 a.m. at North Coast Electric, exposures to the measles virus were possible.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anyone concerned about their proximity to these locations during these times should contact the Gallatin County Health Department if they experience a cough, runny nose, fevers, red watery eyes, and then the appearance of little white spots in their mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A rash often develops, sometimes starting on the forehead and then spreading down the rest of the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Friday, public health officials said no new suspected infections had been reported. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We have no evidence whatsoever that there is a connection to any other community in Montana outside of Gallatin County or to Wyoming at this time,” said Bulger. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poster In The Hall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Family nurse practitioner Liesel Pessl worked at Community Health Partners, a federally funded health center in Gallatin County, for 24 years. In that time, she never treated a patient suspected of a measles infection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We had a poster in our hallway showing common or what historically have been common infections that had rashes that we might have to identify at some point,” Pessl said. “But over the course of my time there, I never once saw a measles rash. It has a pretty definitive rash inside the mouth that is unique.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pessl did encounter parents who were hesitant to vaccinate their children with the Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine, also known as the MMR. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When you talk to patients about vaccines and they are hesitant, what I would always try to do is help understand what their concerns were,” said Pessl. “If it were an autism concern, we could try to have that discussion about how, yes there was a study, but it was retracted and found to not be accurate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The medical staff contacted by Cowboy State Daily also warned about misinformation about vitamin A. It apparently helps reduce symptoms in children, but must be administered in precise doses because too much can cause an overdose and result in liver damage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As of April 17, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a total of 800 confirmed measles cases were being monitored in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington and Texas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And now Montana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Madison can be reached at &lt;a href="mailto:david@cowboystatedaily.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;david@cowboystatedaily.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Cowboy State Daily</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 00:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxPdGpiQzdURXVFZlMzeUxleGt3Y3U1NldHNW81bVJKdUswU3Z4WFFYR0lGRU5yTmVuSWJVeWNjelcxc05hZkRuajQyd1ZpSnpLaG1VLVBqQ0NoU0lYMTNta1p3NkJDTTRQRlAyTjVNbTB6UUpDU1NqdUhqYjFrcTdHaHl3R3MtY2pJeWpJWG1ZXy0wRmpkd1BySU5Pa2l0THg5NnRWUWRqUlpza0NVWWxnSzhSMA</guid></item><item><title>俄勒冈州罕见的疯牛病导致2人死亡- SFGATE | Rare mad cow-like brain disease kills 2 in Oregon - SFGATE</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNelJHVE5ScXQxQk52RUEtUzExZnc5NVk1cmg0U3EtazB4Qnd6ZFRabUZORWl3a0h6ODFxZkR6cDJtOUQ5eFVnNEMwZmJKcDZlcXhSSDBFZVhNRHd4X1BxUnQxWjRZcHVsWng3NHVIaEhYZ1loRkdreEZUME52cXhYeEdpeHU3NzlHM1JGdnNiR2FqQVZ4SFBj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three cases of a rare and fatal brain disorder have been identified in Hood River County, Oregon, local health officials have confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an April 14 &lt;a href="https://www.hoodrivercounty.gov/index.asp?SEC=AF40862A-8B0E-4107-B2B4-956029C71941&amp;amp;DE=11E4744C-DDC6-4DBD-8F95-B86EFBB310E6" data-link="native" class=""&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the Hood River County Health Department confirmed one case and identified two probable cases of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/about/index.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&lt;/a&gt;, or CJD — a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative condition &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/about/index.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;with a 100% fatality rate&lt;/a&gt;.

Most people die within a year once symptoms occur, according to the CDC. One of the CJD cases was confirmed through an autopsy, while the other two are considered presumptive diagnoses, &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/04/2-in-oregon-die-of-rare-brain-disease.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;the Oregonian &lt;/a&gt;reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trish Elliott, the director of the Hood River County Health Department, told the outlet that presumptive cases can only be confirmed after death through the testing of brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid.
