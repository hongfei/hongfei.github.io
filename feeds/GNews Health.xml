							&lt;p&gt;You know those people who make you do a double-take when you find out their real age? The ones who look 40 when they're pushing 60, or seem frozen at 50 while celebrating their 70th birthday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've all met them. And while we might assume they hit the genetic lottery, the truth is more encouraging than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While genetics do play a role in how we age, our daily habits have an enormous impact on whether we look and feel younger than our chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't expensive treatments, invasive procedures, or extreme lifestyle overhauls we're talking about. Instead, they're consistent, often simple choices that compound over time. Small decisions made day after day that either accelerate or decelerate the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part? It's never too late to start incorporating these habits. Whether you're 25 or 65, your body responds to positive changes faster than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what exactly are these age-defying habits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They prioritize quality sleep every single night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever notice how a bad night's sleep makes you look like you've aged five years overnight?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's actual science behind this. As Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at &lt;em&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9059444-sleep-is-the-single-most-effective-thing-we-can-do"&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;: "Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who look decades younger treat sleep like a non-negotiable appointment with themselves. They're not scrolling their phones until midnight or binge-watching shows until 2 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, they've figured out their optimal sleep schedule and stick to it religiously. Seven to nine hours isn't just a suggestion for them—it's a non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They avoid smoking like their youth depends on it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's something that might sound obvious, but it's worth spelling out: smoking is basically a time machine that fast-forwards your appearance by decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted by the folks at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/ss/slideshow-ways-smoking-affects-looks"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; "Smoking changes the skin, teeth, and hair in ways that can add years to your looks". And we're not just talking about a subtle difference here—we're talking about dramatic, visible aging that's often irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen before-and-after photos of identical twins where one smoked and the other didn't. The difference after just a few years is striking—deeper wrinkles, duller skin, yellowed teeth, and an overall aged appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news? Your body starts repairing itself almost immediately after you quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They move their bodies with purpose and intensity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to know a secret that sounds too good to be true? Exercise might literally slow the clock on your cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://universe.byu.edu/2017/06/28/byu-research-suggests-exercise-reverses-cellular-aging-process1/"&gt;Research by professor Larry Tucker&lt;/a&gt; suggests that individuals who consistently engage in vigorous exercise can have cells that are as much as nine years younger than those of people who lead sedentary lives. Nine years! Let that sink in for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes sense to me. The people I know who look decades younger have made physical activity a non-negotiable part of their routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean they're all marathon runners or gym rats. But they do something that gets their heart pumping and their body working hard on a regular basis. Maybe it's cycling, swimming, dancing, or hitting the weights—the key is consistency and intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They protect their skin from sun damage religiously&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a question: what's the single biggest factor that makes someone look older than their years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you guessed sun damage, you're spot on. As &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6047276/"&gt;noted by experts&lt;/a&gt;, "exposure to UV radiation is the primary factor of extrinsic skin aging; it accounts for about 80% of facial aging."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this lesson the hard way after years of California beach days without proper protection. The difference between the covered and uncovered parts of my body tells the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who look remarkably young treat sunscreen like brushing their teeth—it's just part of their daily routine. They understand that a few extra minutes of protection now saves them decades of visible aging later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's probably the simplest anti-aging strategy that exists, yet so many people skip it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They manage stress before it manages them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, people who look decades younger have mastered the art of not letting life's inevitable stresses show up on their face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they meditate, maybe they journal, maybe they have weekly therapy sessions, or maybe they've just learned to let things go faster than most of us. The method matters less than the consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not talking about people who never experience stress—that's impossible. I'm talking about people who've learned to move through stress rather than marinate in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They understand that holding onto tension, worry, and frustration doesn't just feel bad—it looks bad too. So they've prioritized finding ways to release it regularly rather than carrying it around like invisible baggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing about looking decades younger than your actual age: it's not about finding the fountain of youth or having perfect genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's about making choices today that your future self will thank you for tomorrow. Every night of quality sleep, every workout, every day you protect your skin—these small decisions compound into something remarkable over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who look 40 at 60 didn't stumble into it accidentally. They built these habits deliberately, often starting years before they could see the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what gives me hope: your body is constantly regenerating itself. The choices you make today start showing up faster than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So which of these habits resonates most with you? Which one feels like the easiest place to start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you don't have to overhaul your entire life overnight. Pick one habit, make it stick, then add another. Your future self is counting on the decisions you make right now.&lt;/p&gt;

The other group was given the same unit with the filter removed, leaving it unable to properly purify the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a month, the groups swapped purifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Using an air purifier at home may reduce the risk of heart attacks, researchers suggest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood pressure measurements and questionnaires were carried out at the start and end of each period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants who started the study with elevated blood pressure saw it reduce during the time using the HEPA filter, while those given the sham unit saw their blood pressure increase in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This research adds to growing evidence that simple interventions, like in-home air filtration, may help improve heart health for people at risk,’ said Dr Douglas Brugge, chair of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of Connecticut and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the British Heart Foundation, 96 per cent of people in England are exposed to air pollution levels that exceed the limits set out by the World Health Organisation, while those living in deprived areas are at a significantly greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

She became addicted to the devices when she used them to quit smoking cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-five knew the vapes weren't the best for her lungs, but she kept puffing, believing they were a better option than her previous vice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In July, however, she woke up in the middle of the night with 'sharp pains' in her chest, gasping for air as she struggled to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was terrified at the pain and I felt like I was going to die as I was scared I was going to not be able to breathe at all,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eyes rushed to the emergency department, where scans quickly revealed she had&lt;span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14615005/Rapid-rise-vaping-Britain-appears-stalled-users-anticipate-Government-crackdown.html"&gt; bronchiolitis obliterans, better known as 'popcorn lung'.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is a rare type of lung disease, triggered by inflammation in bronchioles, the smallest airways in the lungs, which become scarred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors also found an oily substance building up in Eyes' lungs, which they said was the fluid she had breathed in from puffing on her vape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cloey Eyes (pictured), 25, from Florida, said she used vapes constantly in the lead-up to her hospitalization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I woke up at 2:30am in the morning and my chest felt like it was having a heart attack,' Eyes said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had really bad pains in my chest and had to lean over.

He initially thought stress, years of smoking, and heavy drinking might have played a role. However, as facts emerged, it became clear the cancer was linked to a different culprit altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did Michael Douglas think caused his cancer (and what it really was)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When diagnosed in August 2010, Douglas publicly suggested that long-term alcohol and tobacco use, along with stress, might have contributed to his cancer. He admitted that stress, especially relating to his son’s incarceration at the time, also weighed on his mind. Later, in a candid 2013 interview, the American actor and producer mentioned human papillomavirus (HPV) tied to oral sex as a possible cause. In a quite uncanny manner, parallels were drawn between him starring in films like ‘Basic Instinct’, ‘Fatal Attraction’, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;His initial symptoms, like persistent throat or ear pain, were misdiagnosed as infection, until a physician in Montreal peered deep into his throat and a tumor was spotted at the base of his tongue. A biopsy confirmed stage IV squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, an advanced form of oral cancer, prompting immediate treatment with chemotherapy and radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The real culprit: HPV, not habits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Douglas made headlines when he suggested his cancer was caused by HPV, a sexually transmitted virus, possibly contracted through oral sex. He remarked: “this particular cancer is caused by HPV … which actually comes about from cunnilingus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, his representatives clarified he was speaking broadly about HPV-linked cancers, not necessarily his own case. They added that he did not definitively state that oral sex caused his personal cancer, and emphasized that HPV is a known risk factor for oropharyngeal cancers, but not necessarily the direct cause in every case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is HPV and why does it matter in oral cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPV, or Human Papillomavirus, is a common viral infection that can cause various health problems. It is primarily transmitted through sexual contact and affects the skin and mucous membranes, with over 200 identified types. While many HPV infections are harmless and resolve on their own, some types can lead to serious complications like genital warts and certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPV is categorized into low-risk and high-risk types. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Low-risk HPV:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; These types can cause genital warts but are not typically associated with cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;High-risk HPV:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; These types can lead to various cancers, including cervical, vaginal, penile, anal, and throat cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPV is now recognized as a major risk factor for this type of cancer, particularly in the back of the throat, tonsils, and base of the tongue. While HPV infection is common, it usually clears up on its own. However, in some cases, it can persist and lead to the development of cancer years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPV-related throat cancers are becoming increasingly common. In fact, HPV now accounts for a majority of oropharyngeal cancer cases, especially among men. These cancers often strike adults who are non-smokers and non-heavy drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is squamous cell carcinoma?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a type of cancer that develops from squamous cells, which are flat, scale-like cells found in the skin and other tissues. It's the second most common type of skin cancer, after basal cell carcinoma, and can also occur in other areas like the lungs, head and neck, and cervix. SCC is often caused by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squamous cells are a type of epithelial cell, meaning they form the lining of surfaces throughout the body, including the skin, respiratory tract, and digestive tract. They are flat and scale-like, resembling fish scales under a microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While SCC is commonly found on sun-exposed areas of the skin like the face, scalp, and hands, it can also develop in other locations, including: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Skin:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the most common site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Lungs:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lung cancer can sometimes be of the squamous cell type. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Head and neck:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; This includes cancers of the mouth, throat, and voice box. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Cervix:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cervical cancer can also be squamous cell carcinoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Other locations:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; SCC can also occur in the nasal cavity, sinuses, and tear ducts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can HPV cause SCC?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some types of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) can cause squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Specifically, high-risk HPV types, like HPV-16 and HPV-18, are strongly linked to the development of certain squamous cell carcinomas, particularly in the oropharynx (the middle part of the throat). HPV infection is a significant risk factor for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risk factors&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCC risk factors include excessive sun exposure, fair skin, a history of sunburns, older age, male gender, immunosuppression, and certain genetic syndromes apart from those stemming from HPV. Lifestyle factors like smoking and heavy alcohol consumption also increase the risk. Additionally, chronic wounds, exposure to radiation or arsenic, and a history of other skin cancers can be contributing factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a detailed look:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun exposure is the most significant risk factor, particularly for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Cumulative sun damage over time, especially during youth, increases the risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fair skin:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Individuals with fair skin (Fitzpatrick skin types I-III) are more susceptible due to lower melanin levels, which offer less protection against UV radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="96"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Age:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The incidence of SCC rises with age, with most cases occurring in individuals over 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="99"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Gender:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Males are generally at a higher risk of developing SCC compared to females. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="103"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Immunosuppression:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weakened immune systems, often due to medications or organ transplants, make individuals more vulnerable to SCC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="106"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Genetic predisposition:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certain inherited conditions and genetic mutations (like TP53, CDKN2A, Ras, and NOTCH1) can increase susceptibility to SCC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="109"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Smoking and alcohol consumption:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heavy smoking and excessive alcohol intake are strongly linked to SCC, particularly in the oral cavity and esophagus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="113"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Chronic wounds and scarring:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Persistent wounds, burns, or scars can create an environment where SCC can develop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="116"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Arsenic exposure:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long-term exposure to arsenic, through drinking water or occupational settings, can increase the risk of SCC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="119"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Actinic keratosis:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; These are precancerous skin lesions caused by sun damage and are a significant risk factor for cSCC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="122"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Oral hygiene:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Poor oral hygiene and dental problems can contribute to oral SCC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="126"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Family history:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; A family history of skin cancer can increase an individual's risk of developing SCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="129"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="130"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention and treatment&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="131"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin, it's crucial to minimize sun exposure and avoid tanning beds. Regularly using sunscreen with at least SPF 30, seeking shade during peak sun hours, and wearing protective clothing like hats and long sleeves are essential steps.

			&lt;p&gt;Tiny shards of plastic called microplastics &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-could-accumulate-in-our-brains-more-than-in-kidneys-and-livers"&gt;have been detected&lt;/a&gt; accumulating in human brains, but there is not yet enough evidence to say whether this is doing us harm, experts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mostly invisible pieces of plastic have been found everywhere from the top of mountains to the bottom of oceans, in the air we breathe and the food we eat. They have also been discovered riddled throughout human bodies, inside lungs, hearts, placentas and even crossing the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increasing ubiquity of microplastics has become a key issue in efforts to hammer out the world's first plastic pollution treaty, with the latest round of UN talks being held in Geneva next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-detected-infiltrating-human-brains-for-the-first-time"&gt;Microplastics Detected Infiltrating Human Brains For The First Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects that microplastics and even smaller nanoplastics have on human health is not yet fully understood, but researchers have been working to find out more in this relatively new field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most prominent study looking at microplastics in brains was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-03453-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; in February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists tested brain tissue from 28 people who died in 2016 and 24 who died last year in the US state of New Mexico, finding that the amount of microplastics in the samples increased over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study made headlines around the world when the lead researcher, US toxicologist Matthew Campen, told the media that they detected the equivalent of a plastic spoon's worth of microplastics in the brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170290" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170290" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/spoon_microplastic_642.jpg" alt="microplastic in a metal spoon" class="wp-image-170290 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/spoon_microplastic_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/spoon_microplastic_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/spoon_microplastic_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170290" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Plastic fragments in the environment break up into microscopic particles.

"When in doubt, throw it out," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potent neurotoxin can cause botulism, a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/rare-diseases" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rare but serious illness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;rare but serious illness&lt;/a&gt; that attacks the nerves, leading to muscle paralysis, breathing difficulty, and even death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home-canned, low-acid foods including green beans, asparagus, corn, meats, garlic and fermented fish are the most risky, Picone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent botulism, the CDC recommends refrigerating or freezing leftovers promptly after cooking, throwing away damaged or bulging cans, and following the USDA's guide to home-canning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Large reef fish like barracudas can contain ciguatoxins that cause ciguatera fish poisoning in humans.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I like eating fish, but I try to avoid eating large tropical reef fish like barracuda, grouper and Amberjack because of a neurotoxin called ciguatoxin," Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ciguatoxin is a neurotoxin produced by certain algae in coral reefs as a defense mechanism. It can travel up the food chain from herbivorous fish to carnivorous fish and eventually humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/death-confirmed-rare-deadly-brain-eating-amoeba-southern-lake" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Death Confirmed From Rare And Deadly 'Brain-eating Amoeba' In Southern Lake;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Death Confirmed From Rare And Deadly 'Brain-eating Amoeba' In Southern Lake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurological symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neurological symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of ciguatoxin poisoning can include feelings of tingling and numbness, reverse temperature sensations where hot objects feel cold and cold objects feel hot, and vivid nightmares, Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 50,000 cases of ciguatera poisoning are reported worldwide annually, according to the CDC, but the numbers may be higher because it is often misdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;One neurologist avoids eating large tropical fish because they can cause ciguatera poisoning.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The toxin is heat-stable, he added, so cooking the fish won't destroy it. "This doesn't mean you can't eat fish," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just avoid or limit consumption of large predatory fish, avoid eating certain parts, like the liver or roe, and be aware of endemic areas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ciguatera is common in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and the Caribbean Sea, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen said he does not eat &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:under-cooked pork,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;under-cooked pork,&lt;/a&gt; especially from unregulated sources, because of the risk of neurocysticercosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurocysticercosis occurs after a person swallows pork tapeworm eggs, according to the CDC. The larvae migrate to tissues like the brain and form cysts, which are diagnosed when found in the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A little-known fact is that it's actually one of the leading causes of acquired epilepsy worldwide," Chen said of the infection.

"This type of information ... I feel should be jumped on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauren Vlachos, executive director of the Alzheimer's Disease Resource Center in East Islip, called the finding "an exciting moment in Alzheimer's research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The recent Harvard study showing lithium orotate reversing Alzheimer’s-like changes in mice is a major breakthrough, offering renewed hope for treatment and even prevention," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vlachos said it was crucial to continue funding research, but also to move such findings into clinical trials. "Discovery is only part of the equation," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One expert on Long Island cautioned the study was a preliminary finding and people should not go out and start taking lithium pills.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marc Gordon, chief of neurology for Northwell’s Zucker Hillside, North Shore University Hospital and Long Island Jewish Medical Center, said the study was "interesting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I’m concerned that people are going to completely misinterpret it and think that they've got to start popping lithium carbonate and get toxic," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Dr. Bruce A. Yankner, a professor of genetics and neurology at Harvard Medical School, found that researchers could reverse Alzheimer's in mice and restore brain functions using small amounts of the compound lithium orotate. The amount given was enough to mimic the metal’s natural level in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study were reported in the scientific journal Nature on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The obvious impact is that because lithium orotate is dirt cheap, hopefully we will get rigorous, randomized trials testing this very, very quickly," Matt Kaeberlein, former director of the Healthy Aging and Longevity Research Institute at the University of Washington, who did not participate in the study, told The Washington Post. "And I would say that it will be an embarrassment to the Alzheimer’s clinical community if that doesn’t happen right away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yankner, who is also the co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for Biology of Aging Research at Harvard, told The Post: "I do not recommend that people take lithium at this point, because it has not been validated as a treatment in humans. We always have to be cautious because things can change as you go from mice to humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yankner said other labs still needed to validate the findings of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen said the fact the study was done with mice "doesn't mean that it can't be ... taken seriously" and possibly applied to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is a form of dementia that affects memory, thinking and behavior. More than 7 million people in the United States over the age of 65 have Alzheimer's, according to the Alzheimer's Association, a Chicago-based nonprofit which predicts that number will rise to almost 13 million by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there have been some recent breakthroughs in treating Alzheimer's, researchers have not discovered a medication to stop or reverse it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with bipolar disorder are often prescribed lithium, and some previous research has suggested it could help with Alzheimer’s and also serve as an antiaging medication. One 2017 study in Denmark suggested that lithium found in drinking water could be associated with a lower incident of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Over the course of a year, patients taking vortioxetine showed larger improvements in measures of memory, attention, and reasoning, as well as a greater reduction in depressive symptoms, than those taking escitalopram, paroxetine, or bupropion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia in older adults, gradually impairing a person’s ability to carry out daily activities. Alongside cognitive decline, many people with Alzheimer’s also experience neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and apathy. Depression in Alzheimer’s is common and can intensify the difficulties posed by memory loss and disorientation, while also worsening quality of life for both patients and caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high prevalence of depression in Alzheimer’s has led to increased prescribing of antidepressants in this population. Yet research on how these drugs affect cognitive function has been limited and sometimes conflicting. Certain antidepressants may worsen cognition due to side effects on neurotransmitter systems, while others could potentially support brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vortioxetine is of particular interest because, beyond its action on serotonin receptors, it also influences other neurotransmitter systems involved in learning and memory. Previous studies in people with depression and in those with mild cognitive impairment have hinted at cognitive benefits, but few have directly compared vortioxetine to multiple other antidepressants in patients with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, researchers Eduardo Cumbo and Daniela Migliore conducted a 12-month randomized, open-label study at the Neurodegenerative Disorders Unit in Caltanissetta, Italy. The analysis focused on 108 outpatients with mild Alzheimer’s disease and depressive symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either vortioxetine (n=36) or one of three other antidepressants—escitalopram, paroxetine, or bupropion (n=72 in total)—while continuing standard Alzheimer’s treatments such as cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine. Patients were assessed at the start of the study, after six months, and after twelve months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive function was measured using several established tests. The Mini-Mental State Examination evaluated overall cognitive ability, including memory, orientation, and language. The Attentive Matrices test measured selective attention, while the Coloured Progressive Matrices assessed nonverbal reasoning and problem-solving. The Digit Span task tested verbal working memory. Depression severity was measured with the Hamilton Depression Scale and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the study, patients in all groups showed some improvement on cognitive tests, but gains were generally largest and most consistent in the vortioxetine group. On the Mini-Mental State Examination, vortioxetine-treated patients improved by nearly three points, a statistically significant change. They also showed significant gains in selective attention and nonverbal reasoning, while patients on other antidepressants tended to improve less, and in some cases, not significantly. Working memory scores improved slightly in the vortioxetine group but did not reach statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When comparing groups directly, vortioxetine outperformed the other antidepressants on most cognitive measures. The difference was particularly notable when compared to paroxetine, which has anticholinergic properties that can impair cognition in older adults. Escitalopram and bupropion showed moderate improvements on some attention measures, but not to the same extent as vortioxetine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that depressive symptoms decreased in all groups over the 12-month period, but the reduction was more pronounced in patients taking vortioxetine. On both depression scales, the vortioxetine group’s scores dropped by about seven points from baseline—an improvement considered clinically meaningful. Between-group comparisons showed that vortioxetine’s effect on depressive symptoms was statistically superior to that of the other antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects were relatively uncommon and generally mild. Nausea and headache were the most frequently reported with vortioxetine, occurring in about 8% of patients. Two participants—one on paroxetine and one on bupropion—discontinued treatment due to side effects. No serious adverse events or deaths occurred during the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note some limitations. The trial was conducted at a single site with a modest sample size, which may limit how well the findings apply to the wider Alzheimer’s population. It was also open-label, meaning patients and doctors knew which treatment was being given, which could introduce bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, only patients with mild Alzheimer’s were included, so the results may not extend to those with more advanced disease. The study also could not determine whether the observed cognitive improvements were due directly to vortioxetine’s pharmacological effects or indirectly through relief of depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that vortioxetine may have cognitive benefits beyond its antidepressant effects. The authors suggest that larger, longer-term, and double-blind studies are needed to confirm these results and to clarify how vortioxetine’s effects on neurotransmitter systems might influence both mood and cognition in people with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future research confirms these findings, vortioxetine could be considered a particularly useful option for Alzheimer’s patients who experience depression—addressing not only mood symptoms but also potentially helping to preserve certain cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13872877251340084" target="_blank"&gt;Differential effects of antidepressants on cognition in Alzheimer’s disease with depression: A sub-group analysis of an open-label, observational study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Eduardo Cumbo and Daniela Migliore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 20:03:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOejg4ZXZYWUtrRVNJaEJCbjY4WGpaMUQta2ZWb0RqQmhpenpsNC1LX2pTbUF1YjMzN1JBSGgxVE1zdFRYYl9UY0xmbWsyLXJCTVp0M3poMGZlaFZ2ZFBpWUFvUk1YaDFiWUhMbnY4cXJHNWtVVXFIWG5ZOXVTR2duZ3laNjhOWWt5bVExeEJpdjh0aEdPT0tQUkxNd2dRcEIzZ3FlY3I0dWhva29IOVFUMnFqQ0pWVkQxbFdhTEdONHVWRjQ</guid></item><item><title>天然化合物组合恢复老化的脑细胞-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE0yN1NBMDFkckF3VzhEXzQ2a3VWbjRtelBZN1NVRmcxejctRjlFTGVaRlA5YkNrTTdrQWNESF9JZXB4dFhuQVQxRXpHcklRZ0ZjMmhzd2lDYi1sYVVGZnl0MTU1bHNjR2Y1SjFLZDI1UjdNdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Scientists have identified a natural compound combination that reverses aging-related brain cell decline and removes harmful Alzheimer’s-linked proteins. The treatment, combining nicotinamide (vitamin B3) and the green tea antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate, restores guanosine triphosphate (GTP) levels—critical for neuronal energy and protein cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In aged neurons, the restored energy boosted protein clearance, reduced oxidative stress, and reactivated key cell trafficking pathways. The findings suggest a potential non-drug strategy for combating Alzheimer’s, though more work is needed to optimize delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Restoration:&lt;/strong&gt; Nicotinamide and green tea antioxidant revived GTP levels in aged neurons to youthful levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein Clearance Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; Treatment improved the brain’s ability to remove toxic amyloid beta aggregates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Pharmaceutical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings point to a supplement-based approach for Alzheimer’s prevention or therapy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Irvine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at the University of California, Irvine have identified a promising nonpharmaceutical treatment that rejuvenates aging brain cells and clears away the buildup of harmful proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper published recently in the journal &lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;, the UC Irvine team reports that a combination of naturally occurring compounds – nicotinamide (a form of vitamin B3) and epigallocatechin gallate (a green tea antioxidant) – can reinstate levels of guanosine triphosphate, an essential energy molecule in brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112113"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;“We found that restoring energy levels helps neurons regain this critical cleanup function.” Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tests on neurons in a dish, the treatment reversed age-related cellular deficits and improved the brain cells’ ability to clear damaging amyloid protein aggregates, an Alzheimer’s hallmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As people age, their brains show a decline in neuronal energy levels, which limits the ability to remove unwanted proteins and damaged components,” said lead author Gregory Brewer, adjunct professor of biomedical engineering at UC Irvine. “We found that restoring energy levels helps neurons regain this critical cleanup function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor called GEVAL to track live guanosine triphosphate levels in neurons from aged Alzheimer’s model mice. They discovered that free GTP levels declined with age – particularly in mitochondria, the cells’ energy hubs – leading to impaired autophagy, the process by which cells eliminate damaged components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when aged neurons were treated for just 24 hours with nicotinamide and epigallocatechin gallate, GTP levels were restored to those typically seen in younger cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This revival triggered a cascade of benefits: improved energy metabolism; activation of key GTPases involved in cellular trafficking, Rab7 and Arl8b; and efficient clearance of amyloid beta aggregates. Oxidative stress, another contributor to neurodegeneration, was also reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study highlights GTP as a previously underappreciated energy source driving vital brain functions,” Brewer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By supplementing the brain’s energy systems with compounds that are already available as dietary supplements, we may have a new path toward treating age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cautioned, “More work is going to be required to find the best way to administer this treatment, since a recent clinical trial involving UC Irvine researchers showed that oral nicotinamide was not very effective because of inactivation in the bloodstream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brewer’s collaborators were Ricardo Santana, a UC Irvine associate specialist in biomedical engineering, and Joshua McWhirt, a UC Irvine junior specialist who’s now a Ph.D. candidate at the Medical University of South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding was provided by the National Institutes of Health and the UC Irvine Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this supplements and brain aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#52302230373e3e1227313b7c373627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brian Bell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uci.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Irvine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Brian Bell – UC Irvine&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11357-025-01786-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Treatment of age-related decreases in GTP levels restores endocytosis and autophagy&lt;/a&gt;” by Gregory Brewer et al. &lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment of age-related decreases in GTP levels restores endocytosis and autophagy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age-related declines in neuronal bioenergetic levels may limit vesicular trafficking and autophagic clearance of damaged organelles and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age-related ATP depletion would impact cognition dependent on ionic homeostasis, but limits on proteostasis powered by GTP are less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used neurons isolated from aged 3xTg-AD Alzheimer’s model mice and a novel genetically encoded fluorescent GTP sensor (GEVAL) to evaluate live GTP levels in situ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report an age-dependent reduction in ratiometric measurements of free/bound GTP levels in living hippocampal neurons. Free GTP colocalized in the mitochondria decreased with age accompanied by the accumulation of free GTP-labeled vesicular structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The energy dependence of autophagy was demonstrated by depletion of GTP with rapamycin stimulation, while bafilomycin inhibition of autophagy raised GTP levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four-hour supplementation of aged neurons with the NAD precursor nicotinamide and the Nrf2 redox modulator EGCG restored GTP levels to youthful levels and mobilized endocytosis and lysosomal consumption for autophagy via the respective GTPases Rab7 and Arl8b.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vesicular mobilization promoted the clearance of intraneuronal Aβ aggregates, improved viability, and lowered protein oxidative nitration in AD model neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results reveal age- and AD-related neuronal GTP energy deficits that impair autophagy and endocytosis. GTP deficits were remediated by an external NAD precursor together with a Nrf2 redox modulator which suggests a translational path.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 19:53:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE0yN1NBMDFkckF3VzhEXzQ2a3VWbjRtelBZN1NVRmcxejctRjlFTGVaRlA5YkNrTTdrQWNESF9JZXB4dFhuQVQxRXpHcklRZ0ZjMmhzd2lDYi1sYVVGZnl0MTU1bHNjR2Y1SjFLZDI1UjdNdw</guid></item><item><title>晚上咬牙切齿？以下是修复方法-泰晤士报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNWXJ0VEczS2VYNC1NZGhkT1NsT1J2VlFPa3lwbGExV1dIWjVhUFk3Q0I0SW90NXd6R0hTZ0NobnktSWhISXV6MDR1bDJJdXpkMWZhUGpKM0ltQVBZeGFscWJoSDhpcVUxczZMT05WX3p1M0xmQzVCLXVoRU1IZGh5bzVEaWsxamZrRncwVDdtWFBGTDdLeXpLcWc4d29BZVVaZmhV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 gJBkaT"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;span class="responsive__DropCap-sc-1pktst5-1 enuiNL"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;f you consistently wake up with an aching jaw, you could be suffering from teeth grinding — or bruxism, to give it its medical term. One in ten people in the UK suffer from the condition, which can also cause cracked and flattened teeth, receding gums and headaches, according to the Bruxism Association dental clinic. Why do we gnash our teeth without realising (often in our sleep) and how do we stop it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“The main cause is stress, hands down,” says Dr Anni Seaborne, head of general dentistry at Bupa Dental Care. If you don’t have a way to release stress, it sits in your body and can come out as clenching and grinding teeth when you’re awake or asleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;People with ADHD are also&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; more prone to grinding their teeth, and “some prescription medications, particularly antidepressants such as SSRIs, can also trigger or worsen bruxism,” says Dr Anjum Jahan, a cosmetic dentist who compares grinding your teeth to furrowing your brow or hunching your shoulders without realising.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Women are slightly more likely than men to grind their teeth, but it’s unclear whether this is down to higher rates of reporting or hormonal factors. “There’s some evidence hormonal contraceptives and HRT may play a role in muscle tension, although more research is needed,” Jahan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/jaw-clenching-how-to-stop-vn6kzzkd5" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is stress making you clench your jaw without realising? What to do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Other causes can include sleep apnea, consuming large amounts of stimulants such as alcohol or caffeine, and an uneven bite — a condition called malocclusion. A dentist who specialises in jaw pain should be able to tell if a misaligned bite is behind your bruxism: look for clinics that offer treatments for temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and seek second opinions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If malocclusion is not a factor, then there are lifestyle changes that can help you to manage bruxism. A custom-fitted night-time mouth guard made from acrylic or soft rubber can protect teeth from the wear and tear caused by grinding. “It also helps that some patients become aware of the clenching sensation, which can encourage behavioural change over time,” Jahan says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Some bruxism sufferers report an improvement after taking magnesium. “It is involved in muscle relaxation and nerve function,” says Dr Harpreet Sarna, chief medical officer at Vitality health insurance. A deficiency could lead to increased jaw tension, though supplements should be considered a precaution rather than a treatment. Other lifestyle factors include maintaining good sleep hygiene: try to go to bed and get up at the same time every day, limit screen time, cut out caffeine after 2pm and reduce your alcohol intake as it disrupts REM sleep, the stage when most grinding tends to happen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/how-to-avoid-getting-teeth-stains-dt8hk960l" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to avoid getting teeth stains&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Jaw physiotherapy, massage and osteopathy can help to relax the muscles surrounding the temporomandibular joint, which connects the lower jaw to the skull and takes the brunt of the pressure. A more extreme option is masseter Botox, where small amounts of botulinum toxin are injected into the masseter muscles, which are responsible for chewing, weakening them and reducing clenching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If you are worried, consult a dentist. They may offer biofeedback devices: wearables containing sensors that detect clenching and train you to stop doing it using vibration, sound or mild electrical stimulation, which the brain can process even while you are asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNWXJ0VEczS2VYNC1NZGhkT1NsT1J2VlFPa3lwbGExV1dIWjVhUFk3Q0I0SW90NXd6R0hTZ0NobnktSWhISXV6MDR1bDJJdXpkMWZhUGpKM0ltQVBZeGFscWJoSDhpcVUxczZMT05WX3p1M0xmQzVCLXVoRU1IZGh5bzVEaWsxamZrRncwVDdtWFBGTDdLeXpLcWc4d29BZVVaZmhV</guid></item><item><title>口交如何导致咽喉癌，迈克尔·道格拉斯分享了他被诊断时的反应- UNILAD</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxQSnYtUmRkT3hkSnJXWWNHbks1SWZwVllVWTlibUV4dkI4YXFlMW9IeTF0ZTVUZGFLaTRhVnlQRkp6T2JwSjJ1cC1aOXZib3o1M3dTRTZ3X2pnLU96bGhrSWhQSU00a2RrVjRUemdHWWV4a3FRTmJhYUxCQV8zbS1PdWs3US05Um0wODJvVDZGQWZPeG5NVDNjc3hpakk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After Michael Douglas shared how he developed throat cancer due to acts carried out in the bedroom, a study has revealed that oral sex can actually cause tumors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The New Jersey-born &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/celebrity"&gt;actor&lt;/a&gt; and film producer was &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/news/health/michael-douglas-throat-cancer-oral-intercourse-explained-963062-20250807"&gt;diagnosed with the devastating disease&lt;/a&gt; back in August 2010, and three years later he revealed in a bombshell interview with The Guardian that it was due to his excursions &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/sex-and-relationships"&gt;under the sheets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The celeb told the news outlet he suffered from oral discomfort for months and made various trips to medical appointments, until a friend's &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/health"&gt;doctor&lt;/a&gt; in Montreal examined his mouth and found the glaring problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I will always remember the look on his face," Douglas, who is married to Catherine Zeta-Jones, said.

It's great if you get surprised by a wild animal and need to run away or climb a tree, but otherwise, no good for you at all. It debilitates almost every major organ and metabolic system in your body.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To our immune system, naked RNA is a sign of a viral or bacterial invasion and must be attacked. But our own cells also have RNA. To ward off trouble, our cells clothe their RNA in sugars, Vijay Rathinam and colleagues at the UConn School of Medicine and Ryan Flynn at Boston Children's Hospital &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09310-6" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a family of large biological molecules fundamental to all forms of life, including &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/viruses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;, bacteria, and animals. Viruses as diverse as measles, influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and rabies all have RNA, which is why the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; starts attacking when it sees RNA in the bloodstream or in other inappropriate locations. But our own cells have RNA as well, sometimes displaying it on their surface, plain for roaming immune cells to see—and yet the immune system ignores it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Recognizing RNA as a sign of infection is problematic, as every &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/single+cell/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;single cell&lt;/a&gt; in our body has RNA," says UConn School of Medicine immunologist Vijay Rathinam. The question is, how does our immune system distinguish our own RNA from that of dangerous invaders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research led by Boston Children's Hospital and Stanford University researchers Ryan Flynn and Carolyn Bertozzi had noticed that our bodies add sugars onto RNA. These sugarcoated RNAs (also known as glycosylated RNAs, or glycoRNAs) are displayed on the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/cell+surface/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cell surface&lt;/a&gt; and don't seem to provoke the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rathinam and his colleagues wondered whether the sugar was somehow shielding the glycoRNAs from the immune system. This could be a strategy the body uses to prevent our own RNA from provoking inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;When Vincent Graziano, a Ph.D. student in Rathinam's lab and lead author on the paper, took glycoRNA from human cell cultures and blood, cut off the sugars, and reintroduced it into cells, the immune cells attacked it. The &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; had ignored the same RNA when it was sugarcoated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The sugarcoating hides our own RNA from the immune system," Rathinam says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is particularly significant to our body because cells are often covered by glycoRNAs. When cells die and are cleaned up by the immune system, the sugarcoating of RNA prevents dead cells from unnecessarily stimulating inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings could help when thinking about autoimmune diseases. Certain &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/autoimmune+diseases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;autoimmune diseases&lt;/a&gt;, such as lupus, are associated with specific RNA and dead cells setting off the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that scientists understand the role of RNA glycosylation in deflecting immune system attention, they can check on whether that strategy is somehow going awry, and, if so, how it might be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

Research reveals that their brains either resist Alzheimer’s-related plaques and tangles or remain resilient despite having them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These individuals maintain a youthful brain structure, with a thicker cortex and unique neurons linked to memory and social skills. Insights from their biology and behavior could inspire new strategies to protect cognitive health into late life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptional Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; SuperAgers score like 50–60-year-olds on memory tests despite being 80+.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Structure:&lt;/strong&gt; They have thicker cortex regions and unique neurons linked to social and memory functions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Protection:&lt;/strong&gt; Resistance or resilience to Alzheimer’s pathology helps preserve function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For 25 years, scientists at Northwestern Medicine have been studying individuals aged 80 and older — dubbed “SuperAgers” — to better understand what makes them tick. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These unique individuals, who show outstanding memory performance at a level consistent with individuals who are at least three decades younger, challenge the long-held belief that cognitive decline is an inevitable part of aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112100"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne.jpg" alt="This shows an older woman and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;SuperAgers score at least 9 out of 15 on a delayed word recall test — on par with individuals in their 50s and 60s. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the quarter-century of research, the scientists have seen some notable lifestyle and personality differences between SuperAgers and those aging typically — such as being social and gregarious — but “it’s really what we’ve found in their brains that’s been so earth-shattering for us,” said Dr. Sandra Weintraub, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By identifying biological and behavioral traits associated with SuperAging, the scientists hope to uncover new strategies to promote cognitive resilience and delay or prevent Alzheimer’s and other diseases that cause cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that exceptional memory in old age is not only possible but is linked to a distinct neurobiological profile. This opens the door to new interventions aimed at preserving brain health well into the later decades of life,” said Weintraub, corresponding author of a new paper summarizing the findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper will be published in a perspective piece in Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association as part of the journal’s special issue commemorating the 40th anniversary of the National Institute on Aging’s Alzheimer’s Disease Centers Program and the 25th anniversary of the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SuperAger brains are resilient, resistant &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “SuperAger” was coined by Dr. M. Marsel Mesulam, who founded the Mesulam Center for Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer’s Disease at Northwestern in the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, a cohort of 290 SuperAger participants has passed through the Mesulam Center’s doors, and the scientists have autopsied 77 donated SuperAger brains. Some of the brains contained amyloid and tau proteins (also known as plaques and tangles), which are known to play key roles in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, but others didn’t develop any. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we realized is there are two mechanisms that lead someone to become a SuperAger,” Weintraub said. “One is resistance: they don’t make the plaques and tangles. Two is resilience: they make them, but they don’t do anything to their brains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;key findings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptional memory performance:&lt;/strong&gt; SuperAgers score at least 9 out of 15 on a delayed word recall test — on par with individuals in their 50s and 60s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youthful brain structure:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike typically aging brains, SuperAgers show no significant thinning of their cortex — the outer layer of the brain — and even have a thicker anterior cingulate cortex than younger adults. This crucial region of the brain plays a significant role in integrating information related to decision-making, emotion and motivation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique cellular traits:&lt;/strong&gt; SuperAgers have more von economo neurons, which are specialized cells linked to social behavior, and larger entorhinal neurons, which are critical for memory, than their typically aging peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sociability as a common trait:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite having diverse lifestyles and varying approaches to exercise, SuperAgers tend to be highly social and report strong interpersonal relationships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain donation can offer scientific immortality’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Mesulam Center, SuperAgers are evaluated annually and may choose to donate their brains for post-mortem evaluation by Northwestern scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many of the findings from this paper stem from the examination of brain specimens of generous, dedicated SuperAgers who were followed for decades,” said co-author Dr. Tamar Gefen, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Feinberg, director of Feinberg’s Laboratory for Translational Neuropsychology and a neuropsychologist at the Mesulam Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am constantly amazed by how brain donation can enable discovery long after death, offering a kind of scientific immortality.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.brain.northwestern.edu/join/SuperAging.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Learn more about how to join the SuperAger research registry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perspective piece is titled, “The First 25 Years of the Northwestern SuperAging Program.” Other Northwestern authors include Dr. Mesulam and Changiz Geula, research professor of cell and developmental biology and neuroscience at Feinberg and a member of the Mesulam Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this aging and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#78130b19150d1d140b17163816170a0c100f1d0b0c1d0a16561d1c0d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kristin Samuelson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://northwestern.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kristin Samuelson – Northwestern University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The First 25 Years of the Northwestern SuperAging Program&lt;/a&gt;” by Sandra Weintraub et al. &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp;

they also have a region in the cingulate gyrus that is thicker than younger neurotypical adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to cellular biology, superagers have fewer Alzheimer’s disease–type changes in the brain, greater size of entorhinal neurons, fewer inflammatory microglia in white matter, better preserved cholinergic innervation, and a greater density of evolutionarily progressive von Economo neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, deeper characterization of the superaging phenotype may lead to interventions that enhance resistance and resilience to involutional changes considered part of average (i.e., “normal”) brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This line of work is helping to revise common misperceptions about the cognitive potential of senescence and has inspired investigations throughout the United States and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Local health officials are still investigating how a Pierce County woman who hadn’t traveled recently &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/malaria-possibly-contracted-in-wa-would-be-states-first-case/" class="content-link"&gt;might have contracted malaria&lt;/a&gt; — but however it happened, the situation involved an “unusual sequence of events.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is rare for a few reasons, said Dr. James Miller, health officer of the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department, which &lt;a href="https://tpchd.org/news/we-are-investigating-possible-locally-acquired-case-of-malaria/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;announced the news &lt;/a&gt;Wednesday. It’s Washington state’s first locally acquired case, meaning the woman was most likely bitten here by a malaria-infected mosquito, which would have gotten malaria after biting someone else with the disease, who had traveled recently and perhaps contracted malaria abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that were the case, it would be a “very unusual sequence of events” Miller said, “which is why we’re doing this more extensive investigation for this case than we would typically for a travel-acquired malaria case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mosquito-borne disease does not spread from person to person, nor does it spread between mosquitoes, so risk to the general public is low, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient is receiving treatment, Miller said, but declined to give more details about her condition. He noted it’s common for people with malaria to be hospitalized, as the disease can cause very serious infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chance of the malaria-infected mosquito biting another person in the county is “pretty low,” Miller reiterated. “But of course, malaria is a serious disease. That’s why we’re taking this seriously and doing a full investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation includes, in the meantime, a plan to work with the state Department of Health to set up mosquito traps all over the county and collect data from them. It’s unlikely they’ll find the malaria-infected mosquito that bit the Pierce County patient, Miller acknowledged, but the data is useful in gauging how many other mosquitoes might be carrying the malaria parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main purpose is really just to get a sense of … the burden for the population of Anopheles mosquitoes, which is the set of species that can transmit malaria,” Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the investigation also looks at other patients in Washington recently diagnosed with malaria, to see if there could be any potential connections, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, malaria cases are usually linked to travel, mainly from sub-Saharan African countries, and regions of South America and Southeast Asia, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Anopheles mosquitoes, which are in Pierce County and Washington, can transmit malaria across the U.S. if they bite someone infected with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. sees about 2,000 to 2,500 cases per year, and &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/public-health-provider-resources/notifiable-conditions/malaria" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;Washington sees 20 to 70 reports of malaria&lt;/a&gt; in travelers each year, according to the state Department of Health. In 2023, the U.S. saw its first locally acquired malaria case in 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten cases were reported across four states — &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7342a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;Florida, Texas, Maryland and Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; — from May to October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, 19 cases of travel-associated malaria have been reported in Washington state, according to DOH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Miller said, mosquito populations are starting to shrink in Pierce County and throughout the state at this point in the year. Mosquitoes like warm weather and being near water to breed, so they prefer early summer, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When temperatures fall, populations also decline, Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, people should try to take basic precautions to avoid getting bit, he said, including: wearing bug spray, removing standing water in yards and considering long pants or long sleeves if in a place there are mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if traveling to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/hcp/preparing-international-travelers/yellow-fever-vaccine-and-malaria-prevention-information-by-country.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;country where there’s risk of malaria&lt;/a&gt;, think about precautionary measures such as taking medication before, during and after your trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease typically causes fever, chills, body aches, headaches and fatigue. Without treatment, it &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/php/surveillance-report/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;can be fatal&lt;/a&gt;, Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people recognize these symptoms or suspect malaria, health officials recommend seeking early testing and treatment. The disease can be treated with antimalarial drugs. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I had chicken pox as a child and shingles as an adult. I have gotten the Shingrix vaccine. For an occasional cold sore, I use acyclovir, but I take L-lysine daily for prevention. Has anyone studied this as an alternative prevention against Alzheimer’s disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="62FT2YPZYVEHRC4PRRPGRQDXWE"&gt;As I understand it, the herpes virus might be a contributing factor. Since L-lysine is available without a prescription in the U.S., it could be an alternative to antiviral drugs for many people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HYX7NPUHSFHXPMOCDNSVHZZHSA"&gt;A. The link between herpes virus infection and AD is tantalizing, but it has not yet been firmly established. What we know about L-lysine is that it can help reduce outbreaks of cold sores due to herpes (Viruses, June 2, 2023). According to the scientists, the effective dose of this dietary supplement is at least 1 gram per day. We found no studies of L-lysine being used to prevent AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5EVWBTU5L5ACFHWUICHCFAIOQA"&gt;L-lysine is an essential amino acid. Another amino acid, arginine, counteracts the antiviral action of lysine. As a result, L-lysine appears to be more effective if people reduce their intake of arginine from sources such as legumes, nuts and meat like turkey, chicken or pork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RM2L4IZXVRE6DPNYFRZIXB76AI"&gt;It was smart of you to get vaccinated against shingles. The varicella zoster virus that causes both chicken pox and shingles has also been implicated in AD. Studies in Wales and Australia indicate that older people vaccinated against shingles are less likely to develop AD than their neighbors who were not vaccinated (Nature, April 2, 2025; JAMA, April 23, 2025). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM" data-fusion-component="FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM" data-fusion-component="FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AW27S6DSHFCL3LRTWJSJCAN7NU"&gt;Q. I have read that there is now an epinephrine nasal spray called neffy for severe allergic reactions or even anaphylaxis. It requires a prescription and is pricey. Why not use over-the-counter Primatene Mist instead? It’s far less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DEXAM7NQ3FFRXIKIYALXO7OUXI"&gt;A. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction.

German scientists studied Primatene Mist to see if it could be used as a substitute treatment for anaphylaxis and found it is not suitable (Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft, May 2009). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JF7WMR57UVAULCBW4SMLVD74DY"&gt;On the other hand, neffy was developed specifically to immediately provide an appropriate dose of epinephrine.

Sleep is more than just clocking in the recommended eight hours; the quality also matters, substantially.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/08/09/550x309/sleep_1754741870752_1754741870898.jpg" alt="A good and comfotable sleep necessitates cummulative of habits that " title="A good and comfotable sleep necessitates cummulative of habits that "&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/08/09/550x309/sleep_1754741870752_1754741870898.jpg" alt="A good and comfotable sleep necessitates cummulative of habits that " title="A good and comfotable sleep necessitates cummulative of habits that "&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;A good and comfotable sleep necessitates cummulative of habits that&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite getting the recommended hours of sleep, if you are still tossing and turning, changing sides, flipping pillows to the cold side, or counting sheep to fall asleep, then the quality of sleep may be poor.

He elaborated, “Sleep hygiene refers to the daily habits and environment that support deep, restorative sleep. It’s not just about getting eight hours, it’s about setting up your body and mind to sleep well. When sleep suffers, everything from focus and mood to immunity can take a hit.” Certain habits help in preparing the body and mind to achieve deep, restorative sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Waseem shared 5 habits that you need to make a note of if you are seeking deep sleep:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Regularly changing pillow covers and bedsheets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/08/09/original/pillow_1754742980992.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Change your pillow cover to reduce skin discomfort.(Shutterstock)" title="Change your pillow cover to reduce skin discomfort.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Change your pillow cover to reduce skin discomfort.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean your pillow cover and bedsheets every week to prevent the buildup of dust, sweat, and allergens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These irritants can lead to skin discomfort and sinus problems that interrupt your sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your bedding fresh not only feels better but also helps create a healthier sleep environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Go to bed and wake up at same time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This consistent routine helps regulate your body’s internal clock and improves the quality of your sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. No screen before bed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blue light from phones, tablets, and TVs can disrupt melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turn off screens at least one hour before going to bed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Turn your bedroom dark&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/08/09/original/dark_bedd_1754743127930.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Turn your bedroom dark for restful sleep.(Shutterstock)" title="Turn your bedroom dark for restful sleep.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Turn your bedroom dark for restful sleep.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your bedroom dark, cool, quiet, and clutter-free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using blackout curtains or white noise machines can further promote restful sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Avoid caffeine or heavy meals before bed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Caffeine can stay in your system for hours.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heavy food may cause gut discomfort that disrupts sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opt for lighter meals earlier in the evening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

class="paywall"&gt;Back in January, I woke up to find my PurpleAir Zen outdoor air quality monitor glowing bright red. This happened over several days, and I was confused because the numbers were well over 100 and yet there wasn’t an air quality alert for the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The annual AQI for my &lt;a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-explorer/air-quality/?id=2023#display=map"&gt;neighborhood&lt;/a&gt; is under 50—considered good air. For context, an AQI of 100 or more is unhealthy for sensitive groups, and an AQI of 150 is unhealthy for everyone. I mentioned the unhealthy air to a friend who reminded me that New York City recently installed a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/brooklyn-concrete-recycling-plant-dust-noise/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/brooklyn-concrete-recycling-plant-dust-noise/"}' href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/brooklyn-concrete-recycling-plant-dust-noise/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;concrete recycling center&lt;/a&gt; a few blocks from my home. The literal &lt;a href="https://council.nyc.gov/shahana-hanif/2025/01/20/columbia-street-waterfront-residents-demand-city-shut-down-concrete-recycling-facility-over-dust-health-concerns/"&gt;dust-up&lt;/a&gt; the center caused, including failure to inform the neighborhood about its existence, might be the culprit for the recent uptick in bad air, from the &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/3221_Concrete.pdf" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/3221_Concrete.pdf"}' href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/3221_Concrete.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;concrete dust&lt;/a&gt; created by the recycling center. At that point the recycling center had yet to implement irrigation to mitigate the dust plumes. The data from my outdoor monitor fed into PurpleAir’s crowdsourced real-time &lt;a data-offer-url="https://map.purpleair.com/air-quality-who-aqg?opt=%2F1%2Flp%2Fa10%2Fp600%2FcC0#7.53/44.244/-69.173" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://map.purpleair.com/air-quality-who-aqg?opt=%2F1%2Flp%2Fa10%2Fp600%2FcC0#7.53/44.244/-69.173"}' href="https://map.purpleair.com/air-quality-who-aqg?opt=%2F1%2Flp%2Fa10%2Fp600%2FcC0#7.53/44.244/-69.173" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;.

National Ambient Air Quality Health Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter, a move that set “the level of the primary (health-based) annual PM 2.5 standard at 9.0 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) to reflect new science on harms caused by particle pollution.” This changed the window of what is considered “good” air on the &lt;a

the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/what-are-the-who-air-quality-guidelines"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, which are a stricter 5 PM 2.5. &lt;a

EPA&lt;/a&gt; is reconsidering the Biden administration's PM 2.5 standards. To quote EPA administrator Zeldin, “All Americans deserve to breathe clean air while pursuing the American dream. Under President Trump, we will ensure air quality standards for particulate matter are protective of human health and the environment while we unleash the Golden Age of American prosperity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The Trump administration also wants to &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0124-0001" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0124-0001"}' href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0124-0001" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;repeal greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt; regulations. According to a statement from the EPA, “The EPA is further proposing to make a finding that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.” &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128229286000095"&gt;Scientific research&lt;/a&gt; states otherwise. And so, as outdoor air becomes less regulated, it has the potential to get dirtier and make &lt;a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/ehp.1509676"&gt;people sick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Too Close to Home&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;This past spring, the smell of campfire filled my home. I peered out my fourth-floor window to see my neighbor’s illegal fire pit three backyards over. I watched the colors on my PurpleAir Zen outdoor monitor change from green to yellow to crimson over the course of an hour. When I logged onto the crowd-sourced PurpleAir real-time map, I could see that my outdoor air quality was an unhealthy 160 PM 2.5 and that a few blocks away, air quality was good at under 30 PM 2.5. There’s nothing surprising about a fire pit generating air pollution, but I didn’t realize how intense and localized that air pollution could be, even though I was four stories up in a half-a-city-block-sized area. This is air quality on a microscale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed"&gt;&lt;p class="CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit"&gt;Photograph: Lisa Wood Shapiro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 12:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFBTM1BobURDOFE4c2VyN2JCV1BMZDBXYnB5YTdkN3JLNUFUYTc4ZW9uREZkTVd5M1E2aXN6UGFnWW8tREM0SzhRMHJYSkFYV1FWYUxBc191SVJ1bEhXSEhGX3VJSmZ4emdpTGRDd0xGWHZFclhhVnp0bFpob3U</guid></item><item><title>一名青少年足球运动员在脑震荡后出现了数月的症状。医生发现了一种罕见的脑部畸形。- CBS新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNRHFjWXNlWHhBRkZGUFVneWMxVWp1b3k3UWIwYUdjT1BjQS1xc1RsZHJOUEhwXzdZQm9ET0tYaGtzdXNtajBKR1ZmaUdXa2MySTg1WFBQckF4MV9VY3RwR19TMXF2S3d0ckROWXUzTURVdTdtZWZMQnc1Z3pkbEFuOHBaNWhGeDFvVlpzcVhYY1lSUdIBlwFBVV95cUxPaTZ4ZWU3MlNjZVRqbW1YZUMwNTJRVW45V1JYd0tXMkhZTHVHUF9QT1ZSY3kxeTJzZjIxV3RIWkhvX1BFc1V6OVJWY2FnVXJhYW1rdWFEN0FFM2dMamQwT2FySnRUQmZGMXEwTEx5dEFiNHRlOHpFUmNtbVVTSXhoXzBWNXBqNndaV2xRZ0RsMVp0Zm1HRTFz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logan Coleridge was used to taking hits in football. He'd been playing since he was 6 years old and had sustained several &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/football-new-helmets-reduce-concussions-cte/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;concussions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. But after a helmet-to-helmet impact during his freshman year of high school in August 2023, he started having debilitating symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Jersey teen said he was very dizzy and had trouble balancing. His memory was "terrible," and he had a "severe" light sensitivity, he said, along with "terrible headaches." Previously a strong student, he now struggled to focus in the classroom and couldn't remember school assignments or what he read in class. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've got concussions in my past, and it wasn't like a normal one," Logan said. "I knew it was something else." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More alarmingly, Logan wasn't getting better. Several months of physical therapy had no effect, said Becky Coleridge, Logan's mom. A neurologist who had been treating Logan since his diagnosis with abdominal migraines the year before prescribed two medications, both of which had negative side effects. An orthopedic doctor suggested looking at his neck. Other practitioners had no answers. Coleridge wanted doctors to prescribe an MRI, but wasn't able to get one. Meanwhile, Logan was missing school almost every week. Over-the-counter medications couldn't dull the headaches, and they were becoming more frequent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early spring 2024, Logan was able to see a concussion specialist after a particularly bad headache kept him from going to school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first thing he said was 'Nobody's given this kid an MRI?'" Becky Coleridge remembered. The specialist prescribed the scan, as well as an X-ray of Logan's neck. The Coleridges thought the scans might show Logan had an issue with his occipital nerve, which runs from the neck to the scalp. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were much harder to hear: Logan was diagnosed with an arteriovenous malformation, or AVM. It was a condition that he and his parents had never heard of before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everything we read was very scary," Becky Coleridge said. "At that moment, we realized the danger he had been in." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is an arteriovenous malformation? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An AVM is an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in the brain, said Dr. Andrew Russman, head of the Cleveland Clinic's stroke program, who was not involved in Logan's care. AVMs put "a lot of pressure on the vein side" and can produce a variety of symptoms, he said. The biggest risk with an AVM is rupture, where the vessels burst and cause bleeding in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a case like Logan's, where the AVM hasn't ruptured, there can still be symptoms. Those symptoms can affect a person's motor skills, sensory and visual perception, language abilities and the way they walk, Russman said. The effects can vary depending on where in the brain the AVM has formed, Russman said. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coleridges had two options to treat Logan: Radiation therapy, a non-invasive technique that uses focused radiation beams to target and slowly destroy the AVM, or surgery. Radiation therapy could take too long, the family decided, and so they decided to have Logan treated by Dr. Howard Riina, a cerebrovascular neurosurgeon at NYU Langone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He couldn't go to school. His whole life was impacted by these headaches," Riina said. "They wanted an immediate solution." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riina said the AVM, which was on a "headache spot" in the occipital region of the brain, was likely the root of Logan's symptoms. People are born with AVMs, Riina said, and they grow as the body grows, which can cause increased symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously, you don't want to have multiple things going on in your head, but the concussion is what led to the imaging, which led to the diagnosis of the AVM, which was probably what was causing the headaches all along," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Raising awareness and "focusing on a new beginning" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logan underwent surgery on July 17, 2024, nearly a year after his symptoms began. Riina performed a craniotomy and removed the AVM. Three days later, Logan was discharged from the hospital to continue his recovery at home. Logan said it was a "lonely" way to spend his summer vacation. Even as his recovery progressed, he couldn't participate in the sports he loved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I couldn't really do the things that I love normally doing, like exercising, playing football was a big thing for me. I was just stuck in bed, pretty much having minimal activity," Logan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Logan has only the occasional headache, and the pain can be treated with medication. He has follow-ups at NYU Langone, but Riina said everything has come back clear. The Coleridges are working to encourage early testing: Becky Coleridge said she wishes Logan had received an MRI earlier so that months of suffering and confusion could have been avoided. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year has been a complete turnaround, Logan said. He no longer misses school. He celebrated his 16th birthday and took driving lessons. This summer, he spent almost every day at the beach with friends. This month, he's gearing up for a return to the football field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The whole experience was a fork in the road for me that I had to get through," Logan said. "I'm leaving that time in my life in the past and focusing on a new beginning." &lt;/p&gt;

He'd been playing since he was 6 years old and had sustained several &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/football-new-helmets-reduce-concussions-cte/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:concussions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;concussions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. But after a helmet-to-helmet impact during his freshman year of high school in August 2023, he started having debilitating symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The New Jersey teen said he was very dizzy and had trouble balancing. His memory was "terrible," and he had a "severe" light sensitivity, he said, along with "terrible headaches." Previously a strong student, he now struggled to focus in the classroom and couldn't remember school assignments or what he read in class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I've got concussions in my past, and it wasn't like a normal one," Logan said. "I knew it was something else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logan Coleridge (#9) on the field. / Credit: Becky and Barry Coleridge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More alarmingly, Logan wasn't getting better. Several months of physical therapy had no effect, said Becky Coleridge, Logan's mom. A neurologist who had been treating Logan since his diagnosis with abdominal migraines the year before prescribed two medications, both of which had negative side effects. An orthopedic doctor suggested looking at his neck. Other practitioners had no answers. Coleridge wanted doctors to prescribe an MRI, but wasn't able to get one. Meanwhile, Logan was missing school almost every week. Over-the-counter medications couldn't dull the headaches, and they were becoming more frequent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In early spring 2024, Logan was able to see a concussion specialist after a particularly bad headache kept him from going to school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The first thing he said was 'Nobody's given this kid an MRI?'"

I was using the family computer and wanted to check my Reddit, and that’s when I found out that Dad has a Reddit account too. I didn’t snoop then, but I did write down his account name and then checked it out on my phone later.&lt;br&gt;I shouldn’t have done that. I should have realized it was private because he had never mentioned it.&lt;/p&gt;

They consisted of complaints about his life, how he resents his family, and then feels guilty about feeling so resentful. How he can’t stand Mom anymore but thinks it’s important to put up a good front for us kids, and how he wishes just once his kids would come to him with something other than a problem we expected him to solve. He said some nasty things specifically about me, too, about some personal incidents I don’t want to share here, but that I had shrugged off as just normal interactions—I hadn’t realized how much I had hurt his feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn’t meant for my eyes, I know. But the thing is, there’s also this undercurrent about how terrible he feels for having these thoughts and feelings and how he needs to “stay strong” for his family. It makes me really uneasy and worried about him. I had no idea he was going through any of this. I feel like I pried open his diary! I don’t know what to do now. Should I just pretend I saw nothing? Or should I tell him?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme3blgn000253b79eunxdanu@published"&gt;Is there an adult you feel close to, who knows and loves your father—but who is not your mother—with whom you could talk this over? It’s really beyond the scope of what a 15-year-old should be doing for a parent for you to take responsibility for your father’s mental health—and to carry the burden of guilt you now feel for having “snooped.” Of course, if your dad put all of this on Reddit—&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your whole family shares one computer—he had to know, at some level, that someone (if not everyone) in the family would read it. At the very least, he was making his confessions in a public space: Reddit is not a diary, as much as it may sometimes feel like one.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="150" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme3bliva002c3b79igstsakc@published"&gt;I don’t know why people reveal their most private thoughts to strangers on the internet (this may be a generational blind spot of mine; I am acquainted with a number of 40-somethings who seem to share &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, no matter how private, on Facebook), but I do know that writing about (what sounds like) one’s depression on a shared computer is a not-so-subtle cry for help from those who have access to it. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; are not the right person to help him, but his best friend or a sibling of his might be. (And for all you know, he is just using Reddit to blow off steam. Some of those 40-somethings I mentioned definitely use Facebook that way. I read their posts and become alarmed—then learn that they’re just fine, really; they were just having “a dramatic moment.” Again, I’ll acknowledge that this mystifies me. But it is apparently a thing.)&lt;/p&gt;

About the only problem in our marriage was his insomnia, and while it was difficult to deal with him getting up 5-6 times a night, every night, it was hardly his fault. Still, after over a decade of trying to treat the insomnia with nothing working except for drugs that had side effects worse than the insomnia itself, we eventually decided on adding a bedroom annex to the home office, and Jeff sleeping there instead of with me. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/11/insomnia-sleep-apart-marriage.html"&gt;Ever since then, he’s been half-assing as a father.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, Werner often sees her patients make the same mistake time and again—they either take too much at once or don’t drink enough water. “Always work up to it slowly, and take plenty of fluids,” she advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, she recommends starting with one small spoonful a day (or less), and then slowly working your way up “day by day, and week by week.” If you notice that you don’t tolerate the psyllium husks well, simply reduce the amount. “One teaspoon to a large glass of water is a good starting point for many people,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, Werner does have one caveat—she prefers not to pre-soak her husks, unlike me: “To be honest, I find the goo in water quite disgusting,” she laughs. Instead, she prefers to simply stir the psyllium husks into smoothies, yogurt, or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/oatmeal-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;. “I now take one to two teaspoons, sometimes even a tablespoon a day—but I’ve worked my way up to it really slowly,” she say.s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What to look for when shopping for psyllium husks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Werner recommends hulled psyllium husks versus whole psyllium seeds. Since they contain just the outer shell of the seed, “they are usually better tolerated and swell up more,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also advises buying organic quality and checking the list of ingredients: “Ideally, they should really only contain psyllium husks—no additives, no flavorings. This is often a good indicator that the products are less contaminated with harmful substances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a beauty or wellness trend you're curious about? We want to know!

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study from researchers in China analyzed the impact of consuming different types of milk on muscle and bone health while aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This study used mice to learn about the relationship between sarcopenia, age-related muscle loss, and four different dairy milks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Findings revealed that goat milk (in particular low-fat goat milk and low-fat fortified goat milk) was more effective at supporting muscle regeneration and reducing inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If it seems like everyone is going wild for protein these days, you're not imagining things. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cargill.com/2025/consumers-are-seeking-more-protein-for-health-and-taste-in-2025" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cargill’s 2025 Protein Profile&lt;/a&gt;, 61% of Americans increased their protein intake in 2024. As &lt;a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/protein-fortified-food-products-market-report" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Grand View Research&lt;/a&gt; noted in its 2025 report, the "global protein-fortified food products market size was estimated at $66.8 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $101.62 billion by 2030."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, according to one new study, you may not need to rely solely on pricey protein-fortified foods and powders to support muscle health. Simply switching up the milk you drink every day could help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In July, researchers from Peking University and Hyproca Nutrition in China published their findings in the journal &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fsn3.70540" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Food Science &amp;amp; Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, giving greater insight into four dairy products and whether they have the potential to delay the progression of sarcopenia, or age-related muscle loss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Sarcopenia, characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass and strength, poses a significant public health challenge. However, the specific role of dairy products in preventing sarcopenia is not well understood," the scientists shared. Studies like this are key to finding solutions for a problem that many of us may face. As one research overview explained, on average, 5–13% of people between 60 and 70 years of age are affected by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3060646/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sarcopenia&lt;/a&gt;. For people over 80, that increases to 11–50%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--youtube"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To figure out which dairy products can help stave off sarcopenia, the researchers fed dairy-enriched diets to mice for eight weeks. The mice were split into six groups: normal control, sarcopenia, goat whole milk, goat low-fat milk, goat fortified vitamin D, calcium low-fat milk, and bovine (cow) whole milk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The normal control group was given saline throughout the trial — a salt and water solution that acts as a placebo — while the other five groups received dexamethasone injections to induce sarcopenia. At the same time, four groups were fed the milk in their group name. This means that one group did have induced sarcopenia without receiving a dairy supplement, acting as a sarcopenia control group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The team then measured the test subjects' grip strength, weight, bone mineral density, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24058-autophagy" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;autophagy&lt;/a&gt; (the process that allows your body to reuse and recycle damaged cells), muscle morphology (the size and shape of the muscles), metabolism, inflammation, and gut microbial health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They found that while all types of milk helped the mice regain muscle mass and bone strength, the fortified low-fat goat’s milk — a version with added vitamin D and calcium — was most effective. As the researchers explained, the goat milk boosted muscle-building signals in the body and lowered levels of key inflammation markers linked to muscle loss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They also noticed one more critical finding in the gut. All of the dairy-fed mice showed shifts in their microbiome, with increases in the beneficial bacteria Leuconostoc. However, only the goat milk-fed mice showed an increase in Lactococcus and Acinetobacter bacteria, which could help reduce inflammation and support the body's metabolism. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Need all of this boiled down to simpler terms?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "This study demonstrates that different types of dairy products have distinct effects on muscle metabolism, autophagy, inflammation, and gut microbiota in sarcopenia," the authors concluded. "Goat milk, particularly its low-fat and vitamin D/calcium-fortified variants, showed greater benefits in promoting muscle regeneration and reducing inflammation compared to bovine milk, highlighting the importance of dairy composition." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It is important to note that many commercial cow milks are fortified with Vitamins A and D, but the researchers do not provide commentary on whether this might come closer to offering the same muscle-regenerating benefits as fortified goat milk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study was conducted on mice, so the hypothesis has not been proven with humans. Nevertheless, it's one reason to search for goat milk the next time you're strolling through the grocery store or seek out a farmers market to start chatting with your local goat farmer about a regular supply.

Most recently, he &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/rfk-jr-pulls-500-million-in-funding-for-vaccine-20803827.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;canceled funding for research into mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, which played a lifesaving role in the COVID pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, though, Kennedy and others in President Donald Trump’s administration have not disparaged vaccines for older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines are important public health issues — for the individual and the community as a whole,” said Dr. Yuwen Winnie Xu, a family medicine doctor with Kaiser San Francisco. “They’re highly effective at preventing infectious diseases, and they also reduce the severity of disease and the risk of complications and long-term issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a population, older adults remain interested in immunizations. That support probably comes from growing up in a time when illnesses such as polio and measles circulated widely — older adults may have seen firsthand the benefits of immunization. They also may be more generally protective of their increasingly fragile health than other age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot’s changed in the immunization field over the past decade, though — from updated recipes of old shots to brand-new vaccines hitting the market. To help older adults understand which vaccines are available and what they do, Bay Area physicians and infectious disease experts weighed in on their favorites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pneumoccocal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shot’s on the top of all of the lists, mostly because pneumococcal pneumonia is so deadly for seniors. Until late last year, the shot was recommended for everyone 65 and older — it’s now advised for everyone 50 and up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pneumococcal vaccine is usually given in one dose to adults, and it protects against multiple bacterial strains. It’s been upgraded over the years to add more strains, and there are now several different formulations available. The vaccine is about 60% to 75% effective against severe illness, and no booster is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pneumococcal was called the ‘old person’s friend’ because it caused people to die very quickly,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UCSF infectious disease expert. The worst complications tend to occur in patients age 75 and up, but even 50-year-olds can have tough outcomes, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;RSV&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RSV vaccine was approved for older adults in 2023 and is now recommended for everyone 75 and older; patients age 50 to 75 should talk to their doctor about getting the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shot, which is given in one dose, is about 85% effective at preventing serious lower-respiratory illness, and at least so far seems to be long-lasting — there is no current booster recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shot arrived just as doctors were starting to better appreciate how dangerous RSV could be for older adults, Chin-Hong said. “It was like the bronze medalist of infectious diseases, behind influenza and COVID,” he said. “We didn’t pay much attention to it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now RSV is understood to potentially cause much more serious symptoms and complications, particularly in very old adults. One recent study showed a significantly increased risk of stroke or heart attack after patients were hospitalized for RSV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used to think, ‘It’s just a bad cold,’ but we’re recognizing that these big systemic infections that cause a lot of underlying inflammation can have downstream consequences,” Ma said. “Really the vaccine is there to prevent those big inflammatory cascades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nurse Michael Russ II administers a flu shot at the Kaiser adult vaccine clinic in San Francisco last September.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend annual flu shots for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend annual flu shots for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults 65 and older should get a high-dose or adjuvanted vaccine to give their immune system an extra boost, Chin-Hong said. He added that annual flu shots are more important than getting regular COVID vaccines because influenza mutates so frequently, so people are constantly being exposed to new strains that they are more vulnerable to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also worries about the H5N1 bird flu, which could mutate to better spread among humans — flu shots, he hopes, will prevent it from getting a foothold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shingles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current shingles vaccine was approved in 2017 and is recommended for everyone 50 and older. Adults who got the pre-2017 version of the shot should talk to their doctor about getting the newer one, which is about 80% to 90% effective at preventing shingles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just shingles that the shots protect against, though. Some people who get shingles develop severe nerve pain that can last months or even a year. “One of my patients described it as a constant sunburn,” said Ma, and couldn’t wear a bra for a year. Some patients have had to take strong pain medications for extended periods of time, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s another potential upshot to the shingles vaccine: Early studies have shown it may protect against dementia too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These vaccines are still on the table, but older adults who are up to date on the latest formulation do not need to get a new one. People age 65 and up should get two doses of the current vaccine; those younger should get one dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A person who is 50 to 65 who is otherwise healthy is going to do fine with COVID because they’ve had so many rounds of exposure,” Chin-Hong said. “Most of the bad stuff in COVID is in people who are older than 75 who didn’t get a shot in the last year. But it’s not a dangerous vaccine, so if someone wants to get it any time, I’m all for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The rest&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;All adults should stay up to date on their tetanus shots — given every decade — and pertussis, which is given with tetanus. Pertussis generally does not cause severe illness in adults of any age, but it can cause an annoying, long-lasting cough. And the disease can be very serious in infants, so older adults who will be around babies should make sure they’re vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some adults may also need mpox or hepatitis vaccines, but those are generally recommended for certain individuals depending on their background or lifestyle, or only advised during outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all cases, Ma notes that vaccines for older adults are meant not just to save lives but to preserve quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any illness can really start the downward spiral,” Ma said. “Even if you don’t die, if you’re sick enough to be bedbound you can lose muscle mass. A younger person may be able to recover from that, but someone who is older and frailer, that could be the very beginning of loss of independence. It could derail your life as it is now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 11:01:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOdHZGTVpORVJyWDEySlhIMF9pclNJX01HQlBUMFNmdG8zbTA2Uk1Mc2xPT3VQNUFWQjRWR2JPMmpydF9CTGFOLWxKMk1CSXhaaXVFa1ptN3JfLXRGTnA2bzFGa3FyNUhRbm5CQWxDUXJnb1dvMFFqUzdLN3JFVGswYVFZblZyN21xb0NmUVotZENsUWJ6QmE0bjNnWkNSWHc</guid></item><item><title>幼儿父母需要了解的高度传染性夏季疾病- NJ.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QBWJUST3PZE47JS5IMH6MECN7Y"&gt;When summer comes around, you can count on a few things.

It turns out there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a correct time to brush, according to dentists. “Brushing your teeth in the morning is not just about fresh breath — it is a crucial part of protecting your oral and overall health,” says &lt;a href="https://bhdentalarts.com/about/meet-dr-rajpal/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anjali Rajpal, DMD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anjali Rajpal, DMD&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of Beverly Hills Dental Arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there’s a growing amount of research that shows your dental health goes beyond your teeth and gums. “Good oral health is intricately tied into good overall health and wellness,” says &lt;a href="https://www.beachwoodendo.com/meet-us/dr-steven-katz/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Steven J Katz, DDS, MS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Steven J Katz, DDS, MS&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the &lt;a href="https://www.aae.org/patients/findmyendodontist/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Association of Endodontists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Association of Endodontists&lt;/a&gt;. “Brushing, flossing and regular dental visits protect not just your mouth, but your heart, lungs, brain and more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you get out your toothbrush, use the following tips to maximize your dental routine and time your tooth-brushing perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should you brush before or after breakfast?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both dentists we talked to agreed that if you only brush once in the morning, it’s best to do it right after you wake up — before you have anything to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition to getting rid of that horrible morning breath, it is important to brush your teeth in the morning to remove the plaque and bacteria that developed overnight,” says Dr. Katz. That’s because when you’re sleeping, your body doesn’t produce as much saliva as it does when you’re awake so there’s no liquid in your mouth to rinse off bacteria throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If left on your teeth, it will lead to tooth decay and gum disease,” adds Dr. Katz. “And if you breathe with your mouth open while you sleep — as opposed to breathing through your nose — brushing first thing in the morning is even more important, because &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22734-mouth-breathing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:breathing through your mouth;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;breathing through your mouth&lt;/a&gt; dries out the oral tissues, reduces salivary flow and increases plaque build-up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brushing beforehand also “coats your teeth with protective fluoride, hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate or other minerals that may be in your preferred toothpaste,” says Dr. Rajpal. This “protects your teeth from acid attacks when you eat breakfast, especially if it is something sugary or acidic, says Dr. Rajpal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should you brush again after breakfast?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably, but there are a few things to keep in mind so it’s best to double-check with your dentist. “It is not recommended if you have exposed roots, thin enamel or tooth sensitivity because frequent brushing could aggravate it,” says Dr. Rajpal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14684979/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; it's also best to wait 30 minutes after eating or drinking, especially if you’ve had acidic &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a65256285/drink-coffee-live-longer-study-ampk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:coffee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; or juice. “Brushing too soon after acid exposure can actually damage your enamel, which becomes temporarily softened,” says Dr. Rajpal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you need to consider &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you brush your teeth. “The appropriate technique is crucial,” says Dr. Katz. “Brushing too aggressively can lead to gum recession, erosion of the enamel and sensitivity. Speak to your dentist and/or hygienist about the appropriate brushing technique.” They may recommend using a soft-bristled brush with light pressure and avoiding abrasive toothpaste like some that contain baking soda, charcoal or whitening agents, according to Dr. Rajpal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If over-brushing is a concern for you and “if you really want a clean, fresh mouth after breakfast or coffee but have already brushed before, try just rinsing instead with a refreshing natural or alcohol-free mouthwash,” says Dr. Rajpal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should you also brush after lunch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most people, brushing twice a day, morning and night, is enough to maintain good oral health,” says Dr. Rajpal. “However, brushing after lunch can be a smart move if you are prone to cavities or gum disease; you have eaten something sticky, sugary or acidic; you are wearing braces, aligners, or other appliances that trap food; or you will not be able to brush again for many hours possibly due to a long work shift or travel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to do a better job of brushing your teeth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take your oral health care to the next level with these tips for brushing your teeth:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Floss first.&lt;/strong&gt; Dr. Katz recommends flossing before you brush your teeth. &lt;a href="https://aap.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/JPER.17-0149" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has found that people who floss first remove more plaque from between their teeth and have higher concentrations of fluoride in the plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t rush it. “&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19723429/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Most people brush for 30 to 45 seconds, but you need a full 2 minutes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Most people brush for 30 to 45 seconds, but you need a full 2 minutes&lt;/a&gt; to properly clean all surfaces of every tooth,” says Dr. Rajpal. “Try using a timer or a song to pace yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angle your toothbrush.&lt;/strong&gt; “Always hold your brush at a 45-degree angle toward the gumline — not flat against your teeth,” says Dr. Rajpal. “This helps clean where plaque starts, right where the teeth and gums meet.” While you’re at it, make sure you brush your tongue, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you go electric, buy the right one.&lt;/strong&gt; “A $3 manual toothbrush can outperform a $200 electric one if you are using proper technique, brushing long enough and being thorough,” says Dr. Rajpal. “However, if you prefer, a good electric toothbrush often includes timers and pressure sensors to protect your gums.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skip the rinse.&lt;/strong&gt; “After brushing, spit but don’t rinse with water right away,” says Dr. Rajpal. “This leaves fluoride or other toothpaste minerals on your teeth longer, allowing it to strengthen enamel more effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toss old brushes.&lt;/strong&gt; “Replace your toothbrush or electric brush head every 3 months — or sooner if the bristles are frayed,” says Dr. Rajpal. Store your current brush upright in open air and not enclosed in a case where bacteria can thrive, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brush your teeth right before bed and right when you wake up and floss daily. See your dentist for regular checkups and don’t ignore pain or sensitivity in your mouth. “Nothing looks, functions or feels like our own teeth,” says Dr. Katz. “Teeth are essential for speech, eating and our all-important smiles. In addition, maintaining healthy teeth leads to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11169959/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improved cardiovascular health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;improved cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10955347/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduced risk of diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reduced risk of diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and enables &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10870735/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:better cognitive function;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;better cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;.

She wasn’t referred by anyone; she didn’t come with a friend. A 21-year-old woman of Indian heritage with an American accent who grew up in Hong Kong and had recently arrived in London, Naina just “fell in” off the street in January 2022, say her yoga teachers, Hamish Hendry and Louise Newton. But it became part of her daily life. Every morning, she returned to practise there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Chatting after class, they learned that Naina had just graduated from university in the US and had been interning at the investment bank Goldman Sachs and the consulting firm McKinsey. She was studying in London before beginning a high-flying job as a business analyst at McKinsey in New York in the autumn.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“She was really focused,” Newton remembers. “She would say, ‘My goals are to be a CEO,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to have three children, to be married.’ She was really clear on what the future was going to hold for her.” By May 2022, she had left London to embark on her next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/mental-health","type":"Keyword","title":"Mental health"},{"id":"society/youngpeople","type":"Keyword","title":"Young people"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","type":"Keyword","title":"Parents and parenting"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","type":"Keyword","title":"Family"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"campaign/email/inside-saturday","type":"Campaign","title":"Inside Saturday (newsletter signup)"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/jenny-kleeman","type":"Contributor","title":"Jenny Kleeman","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2020/11/11/Jenny_Kleeman.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=b3019c40380ff691069b9a8614631ade"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/saturday","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Saturday"},{"id":"theguardian/saturday/features","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/saturday-magazine","type":"Tracking","title":"Saturday Magazine"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/aug/09/how-one-mother-lost-her-daughter-to-mental-illness","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But 18 months later, in November 2023, Naina was back – and she was a different person. “She’d do her posture, then zone out,” Hendry says. When he asked if she was having intrusive thoughts, she told him she didn’t know. “She was like a shadow of herself,” Newton says. “She was here, but out of it, just very slightly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Throughout 2024, Naina kept changing address. She began to say strange things. “She was determined she was going to live in a specific house on Highbury Fields and said she’d contacted the owner to say that she wanted to live there,” Newton tells me. After a conversation with Hendry about a high-end yoga-wear brand, she told them she had bought every item in the range. One day, Naina announced she’d bought the entire range of Jellycat stuffed toys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Then, in August 2024, Naina messaged Hendry to say people were following her and she had changed her phone number and was going to have to change her name. “I don’t know anyone outside the shala [yoga studio],” she wrote, “so on the rare occasion someone you don’t know asks about me, they should be sent away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hendry and Newton say they “signposted” her to mental health services, but Naina kept changing her phone number, and after the second or third time, they lost contact with her. Just as Naina fell into the studio out of nowhere, she seemed to disappear into thin air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But somebody &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; trying to track Naina down: Vandana Luthra, the mother Naina had told Hendry and Newton was dead. The story of Naina Mishra’s final year in London is one of family estrangement and mental health crisis. It shows how ill-equipped we are at recognising the signs of mental illness, and how powerless parents can be if their young adult children say they want to be left alone. For months, Vandana had been going to extraordinary lengths to find Naina, desperately clutching at every straw because she believed her daughter’s life was at risk. And she was right. By October 2024, Naina was dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;andana speaks to me for many hours, over several days, from her sister’s home in Connecticut, US. She’s on sabbatical from a finance job in Hong Kong while her son has psychiatric treatment here. There’s a history of mental illness in the family, Vandana says – Naina’s grandmother is schizophrenic; her great-grandmother and great-aunt lived with mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Naina always wanted to do things on her own,” Vandana says. “She was someone who did everything herself.” As a child, Naina loved baking cookies, reading books, pretending to be a ninja with her younger brother. But she spoke very little. A teacher at her primary school in Mumbai once called Vandana in to discuss why Naina was so quiet. “She said, ‘You should really quit your job and be there for your child.’” Vandana pauses, ruminating on this memory. “These things stay in my head now, because I don’t have her any more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The family moved from Mumbai to Singapore in 2011, then Hong Kong in 2014, by which time Vandana was divorced and bringing up her children as a single mother. She and Naina used to be very close, Vandana says. “By the time she was in high school, she was taller than me. She used to call me Little Mommy.” Gauri Nafrey, a family friend, had known Naina since she was a baby. “As a teenager, Naina was a kind of A-lister: the dress, the makeup, the hair, everything was beautiful,” she tells me. “A complete go-getter: strong, smart, doing really well academically – the works.” After spending summer camp in the US aged 13, Naina decided she was going to settle in New York. At 16, she’d set her mind on a job with McKinsey. She got a place at Northwestern, a competitive university on the outskirts of Chicago, majoring in economics and business entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a087015f-b38a-46b0-9f08-2cf2e17b1450" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Naina in 2011, the year her family moved from India to Singapore.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: courtesy of Vandana Luthra&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In January 2019, during her first year of college, Naina rang Vandana to tell her she had been sexually assaulted by someone the previous September, when she had just arrived in her dorm. “Obviously it was shocking.” Vandana’s eyes are wide. She was at work when she took the call. She walked away from her desk to try to get some privacy. Questions began tumbling out. Were there condoms? Could she have caught diseases? Naina said she managed to escape before it got that far. How could this have happened, Vandana asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Those questions fell badly,” she concedes. “She said, ‘You’re accusing me.’ I was not – I was in a state of shock, just processing that sequence of events.” But Naina hung up and they didn’t speak for a few days. (Naina made a formal complaint about the student who was suspended from college for a year.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After that, Vandana says, Naina began to change. “She was much more depressed. She kept talking about rape on campus – she wanted me to read everything about it.” Vandana was used to regularly exchanging messages and having calls with her daughter, but now Naina would sometimes go silent for days on end. From halfway across the world, Vandana tried to stay in her daughter’s life. She got one of Naina’s flatmates to help coordinate a surprise birthday party for her 21st in 2021, ordering champagne and food from a restaurant Naina liked. She and Naina still spoke, but not as much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The trip to London in 2022 was a bit of a jolly that allowed Naina to maintain her student visa before starting work at McKinsey in the autumn. She deliberately picked a literature course that required very little academic work. She did a wine course and a Thai cooking course, as well as all the yoga. “Rich people things,” her mother says, drily. Vandana didn’t mind funding it all – Naina was getting to enjoy her youth and freedom – but wishes she’d paid for it directly. “Then I would have known the places she went to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nafrey and her family had been living in London since 2016, and she invited Naina over one night. “I had not seen her for six, seven years. She was completely different from the Naina I remember: soft-spoken, self-deprecating, nothing fancy about her clothing, no makeup,” she says. “I was, like, what happened to you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Naina didn’t mention it to Nafrey, but she had been having sessions with a London-based psychotherapist. In February 2022, she created a Google Drive account and asked Vandana to send over all the pictures she had of her as a very young child. Once they had been received, Naina told Vandana she didn’t want to talk to her for a while. “I am undergoing a difficult treatment for my PTSD and chronic pain. Due to the difficult nature of the treatment, I’m unable to speak with you at this time,” she texted. It was the first time Naina had mentioned PTSD to her mother. (The therapist Vandana says Naina saw in London did not want to participate in this piece, neither confirming nor denying that Naina had seen her, citing patient confidentiality.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When they finally spoke, it was May 2022. In a three-minute phone call, Naina told Vandana that, when she was three years old, two strangers had raped her in the bathroom of her grandparents’ house in a suburb of Delhi. Vandana was bewildered by this. “My children have never been left alone. There are no strange men coming into my mother’s bathroom. The whole thing was just not plausible.” She knew she’d alienated Naina the last time her daughter had confided in her, and tried to handle things differently. “I said, ‘I’m sorry this happened. How come I didn’t know about it?’ And she said, ‘I couldn’t tell you because you were a bad mother.’” When Vandana asked more questions, Naina hung up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;I was in full panic mode, trying to find her: if Naina can leave her dream job, her dream city, something’s very wrong&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They kept in touch, mainly over WhatsApp and email, but the abuse was never mentioned again. “My plan was whenever I saw her next, I was going to sit her down and talk to her about it … ” Her voice trails off. She didn’t see Naina again until four days before her death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After leaving London in 2022, Naina had to sort out the rental agreement for her New York apartment. She insisted she didn’t want anyone to act as a guarantor and begged her father, who was living in Mumbai,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and her mother to put enough money into her bank account to reassure her landlord. By this point, Naina’s brother was in mental health crisis, disappearing for 10 days at a time. “There was so much on my plate, so much shit going on all around me,” Vandana says, bitterly. “She’s never blown her money. So I was, like, all right, just give it to her.” About $140,000 (£103,000) went into Naina’s account. “That’s the mistake I made.” Vandana screws up her eyes. “Once she had that huge amount of money in the bank, she cut contact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Naina changed her phone number. She stopped replying to her mother’s emails, then changed her email address altogether. Vandana tried to message Naina’s friends on Facebook and LinkedIn, only to find almost all of them had blocked her. One replied, saying Naina was thriving in New York. The books Vandana read on family estrangement and the psychologist she consulted in Hong Kong all said the same thing: give her space and she might reconnect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For a year and a half, Vandana tried to let Naina be. But it went against every fibre of her being. When a friend was due to visit New York in early January 2024, Vandana asked her to reach out to Naina and take her for coffee. Naina replied saying she wasn’t in New York any more – she’d left McKinsey and moved back to London. “Then I was in full panic mode,” Vandana says. “If Naina can leave her dream job, her dream city, and go to London, something’s very wrong. That was when I unleashed everything possible I could think of to try to find her.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;aina did not see a mental health professional during the last year of her life. She had no documented mental health issues, beyond the PTSD diagnosed in New York in 2022. But Vandana’s experience with her son’s psychosis left her convinced Naina must be in crisis. Reluctantly, Vandana says, she hired three London-based private investigators (she estimates she spent at least £6,000 on their services). She tried to reach out to Naina’s closest friends once again, emailing them at their work addresses, or appealing to their parents to pass on her messages. The mother of one of Naina’s high school friends refused, saying if her daughter had chosen to block Vandana, she would “respect her boundaries”. The only friend still willing to speak to Vandana revealed that Naina seemed to have cut herself off from everyone. She had quit social media; she wasn’t in any of the pictures from a close friend’s wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Through an acquaintance at McKinsey, Vandana learned that Naina had spent half the year she’d been working at the company signed off on disability leave. She contacted McKinsey’s director of HR, explaining that she was estranged from Naina but concerned for her mental wellbeing, and asked if they could share the reason Naina was on leave, and anything about her current whereabouts. Vandana was told privacy laws prevented them from giving her this information. (McKinsey declined to comment for this piece.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Only one of the three private investigator agencies could find out anything about Naina’s life in London. By mid-January 2024, they had provided an email address, a UK phone number and an address in Walthamstow, east London. Vandana immediately packed a suitcase with a change of clothes and food she knew Naina loved – paneer, pesto, sun-dried tomatoes – boarded a flight and headed straight there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It was a small house. “Such a dingy place,” Vandana says. She learned the rooms were all rented on Airbnb, and Naina was no longer there. She checked into a nearby hotel, lay on the bed, and had a panic attack. “The walls and the ceiling were collapsing on me. But I just had to keep trying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="39873cb6-67df-43ed-a09f-3c97555298b3" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Vandana Luthra at her home in Hong Kong … &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure id="48affb93-5e3e-4300-9609-80cdcddb1ab5" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;… and a photograph there of Naina. Photographs: Chan Long Hei/The Guardian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A hotel receptionist let Vandana borrow her phone to ring Naina’s number. Naina answered, but hung up when she heard Vandana’s voice. The receptionist suggested asking the police to do a welfare check. They were reluctant, Vandana says, but she begged them. “I said, ‘As a mother, I know something is wrong with my daughter. Please hear me out.’” When an officer contacted Naina, she informed them her mother was dead. “That’s what they told me,” Vandana says. “I said, ‘No, that’s not right – I have my passport with me, her birth certificate, you can see my name on it.’” Vandana returned home, her bags still packed with food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a statement, the Metropolitan police said, “When officers attended Ms Mishra’s address she told them she did not wish to have any contact with the person who had reported the concerns. As she was an adult and officers had no concern for her welfare, her wishes were respected.” It was a rationale Vandana would hear again and again: Naina was over 18, she was not in obvious crisis, she had a right to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A missing people’s charity told Vandana they couldn’t do anything without a police report. The two lawyers she consulted said there was no chance of her getting any kind of guardianship over Naina without firm evidence that she was unable to take care of herself. The Indian consulate could not help. The therapist Naina had seen in London in 2022 refused to speak to her family without Naina’s consent. Vandana emailed two sisters the private investigator said were subletting a different flat to her daughter, enclosing a photo of her and Naina together. “Even if she does not want to talk to anyone, at least I should know she is safe,” Vandana wrote. The women replied saying Naina had left some time ago, they had never met her and were unnerved to have been tracked down like this. Increasingly desperate, Vandana returned to London and visited a nail salon Naina had recently reviewed online, asking staff to alert her if her daughter ever made another booking. They never did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;How did nobody who interacted with Naina pick up on the fact that she was very unwell? You could see she was not OK&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vandana recruited old friends from India now living in the UK to be her eyes on the ground. As well as Nafrey, she reached out to Karuna Kapoor, whom she’d known for over 30 years but who had never met Naina. Every time the private investigator supplied a new address, Nafrey would travel from her home in Fulham, south-west London, to walk her dog around the property and see if she could spot Naina; Kapoor would travel from her home in St Albans in Hertfordshire to do the same. Naina’s father travelled to London and spent hours waiting outside one address, only to learn Naina was no longer there. Vandana paid a domestic worker £20 an hour to keep another property under surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If Naina was in a paranoid state of mind, she had good reason to be: she &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;being followed and tracked. Vandana accepts this, but feels she had little choice. “I wanted to see what she was doing in London. If she was all good – if she had a job, a social network – I’d have let her be.” Vandana shakes her head: “2024 was a year I did not sleep. There was so much stress and helplessness. I was constantly thinking, what more I can do?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Then, on 19 October, when Vandana was at her parents’ home just outside Delhi, her phone rang. The name on the screen said Naina. “I had a number saved, which the private investigator had given me.” Vandana shuts her eyes. “It was 4am UK time. I picked up.” For the first time in years, she heard her daughter’s voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Mum,” Naina said, “will you help me? I’m in danger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-39" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Inside Saturday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She wanted her mother to verify her identity. “Tell me something only you would know,” Naina said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I told her where she was born, when we moved to Singapore. I actually said, ‘You were sexually assaulted when you first arrived in college,’” Vandana remembers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Identity confirmed, Naina told her the street outside her flat was filled with black cars, and people dressed in black were waiting to kidnap her. Her mother told her to call the police. “They won’t help me,” Naina said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“All I wanted to do was make sure she stayed inside her apartment until Gauri could come and pick her up,” Vandana says. She tried to contact Nafrey and her husband but, at 4am, they weren’t responding. Naina suddenly wanted to speak to everyone: her brother, her grandmother, old friends. “These girls decided not to have any contact with me,” Vandana says, bitterly, of Naina’s friends. “When Naina messaged them to say she was in danger, did any of her friends rush to help her?” By 9.30am UK time, Vandana had bought a ticket to fly to London. By 6.30pm, she was on a plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I woke up and saw six missed calls from Vandana – and then I saw missed calls from Naina,” Nafrey tells me, still in disbelief. There were texts from Naina, too, saying she wasn’t safe and asking Nafrey to pick her up “as soon as you are able”. Nafrey rang Vandana, who advised her not to ask Naina any questions. “I literally got up, put my jeans on and ran. I was overjoyed – it was what we’d been wanting to happen,” Nafrey says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vandana, too, felt joy and relief – but it was mixed with fear about her daughter’s mental state. She reassured herself that she already knew the psychiatrist in Hong Kong who was treating Naina’s brother. “I knew what to do. I had to just remain calm and get her home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nafrey drove to Naina’s address. There was no fleet of black cars outside, nor people dressed in black. When Naina came to open the door to Nafrey – a woman she’d known since she was a baby – her face was completely blank. “No recognition, no hint of emotion at all.” Nafrey tried to hug her: “It was like hugging a statue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Naina had been packing. Her organisation was meticulous: each individual sock was carefully folded, then placed in a specific bag. The kitchenette was full of expensive Japanese ingredients and obscure wholegrains. It took an hour for her to be satisfied that everything had been correctly packed. “Where are we going? Am I going to be OK?” Naina asked in Nafrey’s car. “She was like a lost child,” Nafrey says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She had plans that meant she could only look after Naina in the morning, so Kapoor agreed to collect her and look after her until Vandana arrived in London. “My first impression was that she was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; quiet. There was almost a translucent quality to her, ethereal. You felt like holding her gently,” Kapoor remembers. “But within a minute, I could tell she was not OK. She was so within herself, and absolutely frightened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="24d6bb19-cdf9-440a-b216-e76a522d9749" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Naina in St Albans in October 2024, just days before she died.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: courtesy of Vandana Luthra&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When she arrived at Kapoor’s home in St Albans, Naina told Kapoor her daughter was an impostor. “She said, ‘I know she’s not 13 and I know she’s a spy. You’ve trained her really well. She’s a really good actor.’” She said that the dog – a soppy, sandy-coloured cockapoo called Ziggy – was also a spy. She inspected the corner of every room for hidden cameras. She told Kapoor that she knew there was a camera concealed in her necklace. Kapoor went upstairs and took all her jewellery off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At bedtime, Naina asked Kapoor to hug her to sleep. “She was like a seven- or eight-year-old,” Kapoor says. “I held her tight. She was lying down and I was just stroking her hair. Then she said, ‘Why do you keep touching me all the time?’ I said, ‘I’m really sorry.’ I didn’t want to say, ‘But you just asked me to hug you 10 minutes ago.’” At 3am, Naina tried to open the patio doors and walk into the garden. She asked Kapoor if this really was a neighbourhood and not some kind of film set. They fell asleep together on the sofas in the living room. In the morning, Kapoor’s husband discovered Naina had come upstairs with her pillow and blanket, and fallen asleep next to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“How is it that anybody who interacted with Naina had not picked up on the fact that she was very unwell?” Kapoor shakes her head. “You could see that this person was not OK.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vandana arrived at Kapoor’s the next morning. She was struck by how fragile her daughter looked. “Her skin was like glass. She was so thin, so fair, so shining – like bone china.” Vandana went to hug her, but Naina looked at her in disgust. “She said, ‘Are you going to take my teeth out? Are you going to take my eyes out?’” Naina demanded Vandana open her mouth so she could check her teeth, running her finger over her mother’s molars: “I just followed her instructions and stood there.” Somehow reassured, Naina sat down on the sofa with her mother. “I said, ‘I’m so happy to see you, Naina. I’ve come to take you home, and you will be safe.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They went for a walk in a park near Kapoor’s house. “Suddenly she said, ‘Mum, you’ve not even hugged me!’ So I just stood still, and I &lt;em&gt;hugged&lt;/em&gt; her and I &lt;em&gt;hugged&lt;/em&gt; her.” Vandana’s eyes shine at this memory. “People are walking past us, and the two of us are just hugging in the middle of the park. It was &lt;em&gt;lovely&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;aina didn’t want to return to Hong Kong without her college diploma. It was in a box in the storage unit she’d been renting, she explained, but it was Sunday and it wasn’t open until the next day. The following morning, when Naina pulled up the door to her unit, Vandana’s heart fell: there were dozens of huge cardboard boxes, stacked from floor to ceiling, taking up every inch of space. One contained 100 dishcloths, neatly folded, labelled and placed in Ziploc bags. Another held six different Longchamp shoulder bags. There was a vacuum cleaner, dozens of ice-lolly moulds, expensive storage jars, an air fryer, designer boots and yoga wear, and boxes and boxes of Jellycat toys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vandana stared in disbelief, but Naina told her not to worry: everything was labelled. She had a spreadsheet documenting everything she owned – down to every nail file and pair of tweezers – the box it was stored in and the room in her future home where it would finally be unpacked. Throughout 2024 she had spent tens of thousands of pounds on things to fill her dream home in London. They found her diploma, gathered clothes appropriate for the Hong Kong heat and left the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They landed safely in Hong Kong the next morning, a Tuesday. On the train from the airport, Naina seemed lucid. “What will I tell people?” she asked. “That you’re taking care of your mental health,” Vandana replied. An appointment with a psychiatrist was booked for Saturday morning, and Naina had agreed to go. She started talking about how great her résumé was – she’d worked at Goldman Sachs and McKinsey, after all, so she should easily be able to get a job in Hong Kong. Vandana tells me this between deep sighs. “She was planning her life. She was not suicidal.” On the Thursday night – during a few seconds when Vandana was in the bathroom and not with her – Naina ended her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“My daughter is gone, despite everything I did,” Vandana says now. “I don’t know how bad her situation would have been if she had remained alive, but I had her right in front of me. I had her in my hand. And from my hand, she’s gone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n the days after Naina’s death, Vandana’s brother and brother-in-law managed to log into her computer. They were looking for any documentation to demonstrate to the authorities that Naina had been mentally ill when she died. They found her psychotherapy bills, and text messages she had sent to her former friends – texts Vandana shared with me. What Naina said in them, and how her friends reacted, show both her state of mind and how ill-equipped they were to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I’ve gone mad,” Naina messaged a close friend in February 2022, around the time she was asking Vandana for baby pictures from London. “I keep talking to the imaginary friends who came into my head when I was 12 and now my therapist tells me it’s not normal.” One of the voices was telling her to kill herself, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Just remember how strong and loved you are. You can get through this!!” the friend replied. “Get rid of all the negative voices by replacing them with a million ‘I love you’s okay???”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="3d6e8e57-ddde-4d48-a0a2-20d07a2bd3fd" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":65,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"The people making a difference: the mental health campaigner on the truth about personality disorders","elementId":"3d6e8e57-ddde-4d48-a0a2-20d07a2bd3fd","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/sep/12/mental-health-campaigner-on-the-truth-about-personality-disorders"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There were texts to three friends in May 2022 in which Naina said the sexual abuse she remembered suffering in early childhood had been perpetrated by family members. But she gave different accounts of who was responsible to each of them. She told one she could remember being abused when she was six months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I approached four of Naina’s friends; only one – a close friend from college – agreed to speak to me, on condition of anonymity. She told me she and another college friend had done what they could to support Naina when she spoke to them about her memories of abuse. “We were doing our best. I don’t think we were doing a bad job, but we were having to therapise for something we were not trained for. And she was seeing a therapist, so it felt like she was being taken care of,” the friend says. Naina had been planning to cut herself off from her family for six months, she adds. “Naina had asked me not to talk to her mom, and I agreed – from what I heard, they had done terrible things to her.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The friend saw Naina for the last time when she visited her in New York in spring 2023. Naina was on medical leave from work, but was feeling optimistic, her friend says. “It was a fun visit. We did tourist things together. At the end, she told me that when she started her job, it was possible that she might be busy with work, and that I shouldn’t take it personally if we lost touch – she’d love and cherish me for ever. I wanted to respect her boundaries. I wished her well and we texted here and there but we didn’t speak again.” When she first heard the news, she didn’t believe Naina was gone. “I think about whether there are things I missed. I wonder whether she was in the right type of therapy. She needed someone to notice something that the rest of us didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I feel sorry for Naina’s friends. They were young and clearly wanted to help Naina and respect her wishes. When I put this to Vandana, her voice turns to ice. She says she can only “have sympathy for their ignorance”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the end, Naina had no friends; her messages in 2024 were only to the people who taught her yoga. “Naina fell through our fingers,” Newton tells me, her palms pressed together, her fingers splayed. “I wish I’d tried to meet up with her, or find out where she lived, or who her parents were. I &lt;em&gt;wish&lt;/em&gt; I had tried a bit more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;No one at the yoga studio knew how to recognise psychosis. “I’d never been in contact with it before,” Newton says. “Even now, I’m not clear what services I have access to. Where do I go? Who do I go to?” She sighs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nafrey and Kapoor arranged for Naina’s boxes to be shipped from the storage unit in London to Hong Kong. They are now stacked up in her bedroom. Vandana has no idea what to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“People have to know what mental illness is. I want to make sure high schools all over the world teach kids to recognise psychosis,” Vandana says. “At every point, somebody or other came in contact with her who could have helped. I want Naina’s story to go far and wide. She died because the people around her were ignorant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNWWVMZmVBMW04c0FHS1RDMGZvVUxtaDZfV1dZZ25TV3lnTVVSNC1SbWlsdVZQem9LS2xXUWlBenBVUlhSUnhWTGJGbC15Q19vMUw3WkpCSGhjU0pyWXV5akkzUEszdHZaelVkX3JxamJOS0pWdUFHZV81TFdSQjBDM3BjM1BlLU5jd1k2cjdrTTRVWnFnaXotR3lLUjAzMm8</guid></item><item><title>高蛋白饮食可能导致癌症：你应该吃多少-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAJBVV95cUxNcnFYUG54eDU4UWFYNG1rNWFWVUF4Q1ROS2hxcl9CaENOeWhvSC1CUUNIZDRGZ0RxTFI1X29fYzEyZjBaMFEteXRCajNCRV9SdWJVcVR6eXh6N2pUZ2IwbFdDNERuMVozQkRpVWhvX0JrY3NfSDhFMnczU0l1b1l4TTR1YVdEUzdMY19XeUJJaGNqZVlyYWdZd2M4VW5seFpObTVUYTF3cjB4el9qUk1QSEJPbUZkblBkUEYxd3c1RkF4cFZTZGtGYTVkamFxWUNRVS1wZXNIXzU5STIxaURqaTB5M3JYWVlnSEZCampoVzJWX1QxM1JwaWc0enFCT0VXSGptQWhsTDZQM0dlR1lnYmhROFlPTC1t?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A social media trend encouraging women to double their protein intake could be putting them at risk of a range of cancers, one of Britain’s top diet experts has warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Increasing protein levels has been touted as a way to build muscle and protect against mid-life diseases such as osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In recent years, the number of supermarket products with ‘added protein’ has surged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to market research firm Mintel, the number of food and drink launches claiming to be high-protein nearly doubled between 2016 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, social media is awash with influencers advising viewers on how to boost their protein intake – with menopausal women, who are prone to muscle loss, often targeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But claims that women need to eat significantly more protein during &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/menopause/index.html" id="mol-31f15f30-74ff-11f0-9400-03163cbeacc0"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; are not only misleading, they could be harmful, warns nutritionist Dr Federica Amati. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Going through the menopause puts women at higher risk of developing osteoporosis and makes it harder to gain and maintain muscle mass,’ says Dr Amati, one of the scientists behind the popular diet app ZOE. ‘But simply increasing your protein intake won’t address this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;But claims that women need to eat significantly more protein during menopause are not only misleading, they could be harmful, warns nutritionist Dr Federica Amati&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Research shows that high intakes of animal protein in mid-life are associated with cancer. For most women, eating more and more protein is not the answer to staying healthy after menopause.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UK guidelines recommend adults consume about 0.75g of protein per kilogram of body weight. For the average 72kg woman, that equates to approximately 54g a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts agree this is relatively easy to meet: a typical 150g chicken breast contains around 36g of protein, an egg about 6g, a 170–200g serving of Greek yogurt up to 20g, and a portion of kidney beans between 7g and 10g.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet some influencers recommend as much as 150g a day to ‘help prevent’ bone fractures and muscle decline in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one Instagram post, an American doctor with 1.3 million followers outlines a daily meal plan that includes egg whites, protein shakes, beef sticks and large servings of meat – totalling more than 140g of protein. And in a TikTok clip viewed more than 430,000 times a UK-based influencer boasts of eating 130g of protein daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘As a personal trainer and a woman navigating perimenopause, I base my meals around some form of protein,’ her caption reads. ‘Our bodies don’t process and metabolise protein the same way as they did in our 20s and 30s, so we need to eat more of it.’ She adds: ‘If I reach 150g, I’m really pleased with myself.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;UK guidelines recommend adults consume about 0.75g of protein per kilogram of body weight. For the average 72kg woman, that equates to approximately 54g a day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Amati says this approach is misguided. ‘Our protein needs do change over time – but the highest requirement is during infancy and childhood, not menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘As we age, we produce less growth hormone, so simply eating more protein doesn’t prevent muscle loss. In fact, studies suggest that higher protein intake after the age of 50 can raise the risk of cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2014 study from the University of Southern California involving more than 6,000 adults over 50 found that a high-protein diet – where protein accounted for roughly 20 per cent of total calories – was linked to increased risks of cancer, diabetes and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adults with the highest protein intake were four times more likely to die of cancer compared with those on a low-protein diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research suggests that tumours, including melanoma and breast cancer, may grow faster if a patient is on a high-protein diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, Dr Amati explains, is due to overstimulation of a key cellular pathway responsible for growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Cancer is the uncontrolled proliferation of cells – so overactivating this pathway increases the risk,’ she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Cancer is the uncontrolledproliferation of cells – so overactivating this pathway increases the risk,’ she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Protein from animal sources carries additional risks, she warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Up to 80 per cent of the protein we eat in the UK comes from animals. But research from Denmark shows that animal protein is richer in certain amino acids that promote fat cell growth and produce compounds linked to heart disease. These amino acids have also been shown to damage cells and tissues, and are linked to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, cutting back too far is not advised either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Amati says middle-aged women should aim for 1.2g to 1.4g of protein per kg of body weight – more than the NHS guidance, but still easily achievable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also encourages shifting towards plant-based protein sources, which help boost fibre intake. These include beans, peas, nuts, seeds and oats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
