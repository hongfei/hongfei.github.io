              'This is day 312 eating nothing but meat, eggs, and seafood. Today is officially week six of the carnivore diet. Whatever you think you know about protein, how much to eat, what kind to eat might be wrong. Four, six ounce tri-tip  sirloin steaks. Six scrambled eggs. Leftover butter and tallow. Always eat more protein, high protein. Typical protein is nasty.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              There is no question about it. Protein is having a real moment, and food companies have caught onto this. That's why you're now seeing protein in everything from chips to cereal. As I think most of our listeners know by now, whenever there's some sort of health fad trending, we like to take a closer look. On today's show, we're diving into the world of what's now being called protein mania. We're gonna get you some answers to questions like, how much protein do you actually need? How much is too much? Is all protein created equal? Can you get enough protein as a vegetarian or a vegan? And I'll even give you some specific ideas for your next breakfast. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, and this is Chasing Life. All right, full disclosure, I approach most trends with some healthy skepticism. But at the same time, don't get me wrong, I think a lot about protein. Protein is essential. So let me give you a few basics. Our diets are made up of three main macronutrients, protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Now, from a purely scientific perspective, we need protein and fat to survive. Carbs, less so. Now, what's so special about protein? It is the only macronutrient that supplies us with amino acids, which our bodies need to function. Amino acids help with everything from building and maintaining muscle, making hormones and neurotransmitters, boosting your immune system, even maintaining healthy skin, hair and nails. So yeah, I wanna put that out there because protein goes way beyond just bulking up muscle. But there is another side to this as well.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I was in LA and I did some interviews there and nine out of 10 people I asked, what do you have for breakfast? It was raw eggs or protein bars or protein smoothies. It was amazing. They've been sort of brainwashed into thinking that they have to move on to protein because they're somehow deficient and they're not gonna be lean and have a six pack and be running marathons.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Today's guest is Dr. Tim Spector. He's a genetic epidemiologist, researcher, and the author of several books that have shaped the way many of us think about our diets.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Nutrition has gone from being the most boring science, and doctors never used to want to know about it, as you probably remember, to one of the most exciting topics that really we can discuss because it's suddenly caught the public's imagination. Everyone's interested in it. And in the U.S., the current trend of interest is everyone's obsessed with protein.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:03:12
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, we talk about nutrition quite a bit. And one of the things that struck me, Dr. Spector, when I started doing this was, I felt like people generally know how to eat well. And maybe I'm being a little too conciliatory towards this, but I think as a general rule, you should eat your fruits and vegetables. You shouldn't eat too much. You shouldn' eat too many processed foods. They know that and yet they don't. Is this a education problem? Is this an access problem? Why despite the fact that people generally know how to eat? Well, do they not do it?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'I think it's a combination of factors. I think, it's fantastic marketing by the big food companies to cloud the issue and make people think they're eating healthy foods when in fact they're not. And it's also a lack of access. You don't have to go very far in the U S to see these food deserts. Or if you're on the road, traveling through airports and railway stations, gas stations. You don't have any choice. It's like the only things to eat are rubbish ultra processed food. So it's that combination really of it being made really difficult for the average American to eat well. Plus the fact that although they know the really bad foods are bad for them, they're sort of tempted to have these other foods that have a lot of these health halos on them. unbeknownst to them, making them overeat. And I think this is where the battleground really is. It is in, it's not fighting Coca-Cola or Pepsi, it's fighting the healthier versions of them, the diet drinks, it the low-fat foods, it's the high-protein snacks that have brilliant marketing behind them, brilliant food chemists making them taste delicious and distorting that. original view that people know that fruit and vegetables are good. Ultra processed food is bad. And they think, okay, I'm getting this high protein snack bar. It says it's low in fat. Oh, I've heard that's good. It's high in protein. I've heard that even better. I'm going to buy it. And the fact that it's packed with 20 chemicals, they don't want it's going to mess up their gut. They don't know that never before in history of people being attacked on all distort what they know is true and twist it, so that the companies will use that information. Oh, this snack bar contains real fruit, right? So, oh, ting, I remember, fruit is good for me. That's one of the top three reasons people buy junk food is because they see a little signal in there to say, oh, I'm gonna buy that. A little health halo, as you call it. Yeah, and currently protein is the health halo. par excellence in the US. We like to simplify things and that's, and nothing's truer than in nutrition. That's why we reach for the magic vitamin pill or supplement while we dumb everything. A very complex science like nutrition down to a simple thing like, what am I going for this? Okay, I'm going for my protein.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:06:30
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It sounds like there's two issues that you're sort of raising. One is that they're wrong and that they probably don't need to think of trying to get that much protein into their bodies, but also what they're giving up to do it. They're giving out more fruits and vegetables in search of all that.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I'm not saying protein's bad, very little evidence. You have to take a lot of it for it to be harmful. So in general, protein is pretty good, particularly if it's plant protein, but nothing wrong with meat protein in moderation, but it's what it replaces. We need to start thinking much more holistically. And this is what I've been sort of preaching in my books is the idea that whenever you add too much of something, you can't get the rest of it. studies have shown that Americans have more than enough protein. They're getting a lot. There might be a few exceptions out there, but most people are already on twice the amount. And yet 90% of Americans are deficient in fiber. And, yet, nobody's fighting the corner of fiber, Because there's no money. There's no money in that.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

                00:07:36
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And so that is this a fad, do you think, right now? Or is this something that is sort of a pendulum swing? Or is there something that we're going to see more and more of?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, I think it's a fad until people realize that you can't store protein. So you either pee it out or it just gets converted to fat. And so if you're not spending three hours in the gym, which I guess you and I are not, then
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:08:04
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You said that just by looking at me? I don't look like a guy. I can't see.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I can't see. You've got a very dark shirt. So you you could have huge muscles that are hidden from me at the moment. I can see that it could just be two hours, you know, I think. But I think it's in part being driven by marketing for particularly teenage boys who are into fitness and bodybuilding. There's a big craze about body awareness and muscles and protein and gyms all across all across the country. It's a bit of a zeitgeist moment that everyone's thinking about fitness. They're thinking about how do you build muscle? You've got Americans on a Ozempic. They're losing muscle when they lose fat. So they're thinking about protein for good reasons. So I think it's going to be here for a while. It's not, it's not just a few months. It appropriate with us for a few years. And I think it will settle down to people actually slowly getting ready for the truth. And they'll realize that If they've been on these high protein diets for a year or so, the rest of that other health will start to suffer.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:09:09
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              How much protein should we be eating? And I will tell you that I spoke to my own doctor about this recently. I do exercise every day. I'm not a big bodybuilder, but I do exercise every and he told me roughly about a gram per kilo. So a gram for roughly two pounds of weight I should be getting in protein. Does that sound right to you?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes, I think it does. The US recommendations are actually a bit lower than that. They're about 0.83. Most countries have that, but that's really for more sedentary people. So the more exercise you're it plays to play safe. And I think for most people, a gram per kilo is about right. As you do more exercise, then it can creep up probably to a maximum. If you're a professional athlete of around 1.6 where you are doing per kilo. Yes. So it's titrating it in a way to your levels. Other people that might need more than one... people who are losing weight. So if you're losing weight, you're not eating much. So the reason you just need one is you're eating a reasonable amount of food and people who eat a reasonable food, whether they choose to or not, are going to get protein. You get protein just from eating spaghetti. It's in wheat, it's in corn, it it's in things that you don't necessarily think about, not just eggs and meat. you're eating a lot, you will be getting plenty of protein for you. But if you're not, you're on a diet or you're sick or you are losing weight, you'll need extra amounts. It's complicated. There are people out there on social media saying you need over two grams per kilo, which is crazy amounts. That means you'll be eating over 50% of all your food as protein. and it's virtually impossible to eat that it makes you very sick and nauseous to actually have that much protein as well. Anything at excessive levels mean that all your nutritional scores from any new any proper nutritionist would score them very badly.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:11:28
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So that's roughly for the US audience. So it's roughly 2 pounds, 2.2 pounds and a kilo. So you're saying roughly half a gram of protein per pound.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:11:41
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So if you weigh 150 pounds, 75 grams, 200 pounds, 100 grams of protein a day.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. And that's, that's being generous because it's, it's slightly under half. So it's it works out that way. So most people don't have to worry that they're already getting more than enough. And partly this is because the Americans eat more meat than virtually any other country in the world, twice the European average. So they're getting a lot of protein already. And it's in a lot ultra processed foods as well through soybeans and are the things that people don't think about.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:12:19
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Okay, let's take a short break here. When we come back, I'm gonna ask Dr. Spector if where we get our protein matters, meaning whether you're plant-based or a carnivore. Dr. Spector has mentioned a couple of times that most of us aren't getting enough fiber, and he's definitely right about that. Federal guidelines call for adult men to get around 28 to 34 grams of fiber for women between 25 to 28 grams. For some context, that's roughly the amount of fiber in a can of black beans. Now, if you are looking to get more fiber, one thing that you're probably doing is turning to plants. But, can plants help us meet our fiber goals? and at the same time, our protein goals. I asked Dr. Spector, are all proteins created equal? You mentioned soy, for example, so soy versus a piece of meat.

              'Meat and eggs have pretty much the perfect balance of the amino acids for your body. We have these proteins made up of these building blocks, which are amino acids, and we have a certain number of them called essential ones, which we can only get through our The rest we can make in our cells and our body. And meat has the perfect balance of these, but plants have all of them. the balance in any one plant is slightly different. But if you have a range of plants, you will get the equivalent amounts and range and everything adequate as you would by having meat. But the misconception is that if you take one plant, you say like soy or you take rice or one bean, it's not going to have the perfect balance of all those amino acids. so you would, if you only yet. that one food exclusively, you might end up being deficient eventually in one of these. So that's why it's a rather strange debate, because nobody actually eats like this. If you're sensible and you're eating a varied plant diet, you don't necessarily need meat to get all the protein you need. But you do need a variety of-

              And the nice thing is that there are lots of plants that are very rich in proteins, particularly things like the legumes, most of the beans and lentils. And they have very high levels of protein in them as well. But the bonus is you're also getting fiber. So when you eat meat, which is packed with protein, you're getting no fiber. So you're not really getting things that are gonna improve your gut health, your immune system, et cetera. So it's a big misconception. it's why. The meat lobby in the US is so big that the carnivore diet people, they just say, well, plants are inferior. Well, any one plant might be, but you add them all together and they're far superior.

              'I had my normal breakfast of a full fat Greek yogurt with full fat kefir, which is a fermented milk 50-50 mix. So I get all my microbes in there early on. And then I had some, sprinkled on some berries. I had nuts and seeds, which I have as a mix to give me a variety of, there's plenty of protein in nuts and seats. People forget that. really healthy fats and proteins there. Small amount of carbs. That tends to be what I eat. I tend to have meat once or twice a month and fish maybe once a week. And that's for a variety of reasons, but mainly it's the main thing I can do for the environment and the planet, which I feel we should do, but I think it's also important for my health. What I'm trying to do is give myself the room so I can have 30 different plants during my week. And that's that diversity of plants, which I think is probably the most crucial rule for nutrition. And I think a little bit of everything is probably a pretty good rule. And we shouldn't be demonizing things like saying, well, meat is deadly or proteins either good or bad, or fiber is bad for you. We need to take this global approach.

              you say protein has this sort of health halo. One of the other health halos is low fat foods, low fat. Are those good things to seek out then?
            &lt;/p&gt;

              'No, those are things to avoid. Low fat, okay. Low-fat foods and you go to any store and you see these huge aisles, especially in the dairy section of low-fat food. And most of them are heavily processed. They've replaced the fat with sugary starches, corn starches and extracts, emulsifiers, glues, all kinds of chemical trickery to make you think you're getting that mouth feel of real on your tongue and these cause more sugar spikes. They're bad for your gut microbes and really should be avoided. They're the worst excesses of ultra processed food and they're designed to make you overeat them. So again, they're a sort of trick by the food industry. It provides a cheaper product that they can make a bigger margin on. There's no health benefit and so it ends up being bad for you metabolism. They're sort of fake foods really and basically low-fat foods are there to be avoided.

              'There's been a big debate going on in the United States, as you may know, about seed oils versus animal fat oils, such as beef tallow and even butter and things like that. For me, because of the family history of heart disease, I think I was warded off these saturated fat oils. That was something that just became part of my way of life. I'm not somebody who cooks with a lot of butter, for example, or certainly we don't use beef tallows. But now it's becoming a thing Those types of plant-based oils versus the saturated fat oils, how do you think about that?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, there's been a lot of hype on social media about these seed oils, mainly from people who aren't experts in the area. And I'm not an expert in the air, but I work with a colleague called Dr. Sarah Berry, who is a world expert in fats and health. And I listened to what she says, and she says there is no real evidence that seed oils are bad for you. high quality human clinical trials. All the evidence is based on very poor data in animals and in test tube studies, which you can prove anything if you want to. So we should go with a big epidemiological evidence. We should go over the clinical trials, and when we do, we don't see anything particularly wrong with these seed oils. So they shouldn't be demonized in that way, but within them, there's obviously differences. You always wanna go for the higher quality ones. shouldn't just throw everything out because you've seen something on TikTok saying that they're deadly. That's just another yet another fad that's going to go. But we should be worried about getting everyone to go back to eating beef tallow. I think that is very much too much saturated fat. And there's no evidence that is good for you. Butter, I do like butter. But if you had a choice, you should cook and eat with extra virgin olive oil, because that has proven health benefits beyond any doubt. So, again, it's always a question of instead of what, which which never gets the nuance on on a 60 second TikTok, you know, it like, we're just demonizing this because of one study. done in Taiwan 10 years ago in a test tube and some big influencer is getting on their high horse about it. It's all really nonsense. So, CEDARS are not deadly, but we should be worrying about the ones that are in our ultra processed foods, the really cheap stuff, the palm oils, the eating too much coconut oil. They are the wrong side of saturated fats you should be avoiding, but. We need to react, not overreact when someone says this particular product is deadly. Usually that's wrong, but it's much more nuanced than that. And we need to rely on the experts rather than just listening to influences. So that's, but that's very hard for, it is very hard for the public though, because they're bombarded with all this stuff.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And like you said, these health halo messages and all that, people have a hard time finding sources of good information about this stuff that's based on data presented with humility, as I think you're alluding to as well. I mean, none of this is absolutely straightforward. And I notice you're not dogmatic about any of this stuff.
            &lt;/p&gt;

              No, I've changed my mind several times, and I think it's as a journey that myself and the companies are led by science. And so if a new study comes out that changes our way of thinking, we change things. And we've just got a new score coming out about ultra processed food that was used to be scored in a very crude way, just with additives. But you realize that not all ultra processed foods are bad. And some of them, just because they contain one little chemical additive. Like ascorbic acid, people were labeling it as deadly, but actually that's not true. And that's just vitamin C. And there's the biggest obstacle to health in the US is this bombardment with all this signaling about vitamins and protein and low fat and low calorie and all this. It's a minefield to work through. So I think we realize this is the time. Everyone wants to learn about nutrition. They're no longer going to their doctor. saying, I'll just do whatever he or she says. I think people want to learn themselves. So I think this is an exciting time, really, for us to change the way we think about food. And that's really my mission is just think about it differently. And I've certainly gone full circle since I was a doctor, I got it completely wrong then. And I'm very happy to keep saying I'm happy to keep making mistakes as long as I get it right again.

It later transpired she was 'really, really sick'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would feel like I have to poo, but nothing was coming out. And when it would come out, it wouldn't be formed. It would be a blob.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In light of all of these symptoms, Byrd decided to weigh herself, and that's when she discovered she had lost almost 100lbs without trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her weight had dropped from a high of 270lbs, following the birth of her son, to 198lbs. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a bid to find out what was behind her mounting health issues, Byrd went to see her primary care doctor in May 2022, but tests - which included an abdominal ultrasound - were inconclusive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was then referred to a gastroenterologist, who immediately started quizzing her about there being a history of colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-25459c90-164c-11f0-b6a3-bd51023251db"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled: 'I told [the doctor] my symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He asked me if there was anyone in my family that had colon cancer, and I told him about my uncle who had died several years prior from colon cancer. We scheduled my colonoscopy for July.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Byrd said her worst fears came true when she woke up from the procedure - which takes up to an hour to complete - and she saw the look on her doctor's face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After frantically asking him what was wrong, Byrd was informed that she was 'really, really sick' and at that point, she remembers screaming and the medical staff rushing to get her husband, Roysi.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors revealed that they had discovered a 'pretty big' rectal mass and Byrd was then referred to an oncologist for a CT scan and MRI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These scans revealed that she had a tumor the 'size of a golf ball' and that it was stage three colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This meant the disease had spread beyond the lining of the colon and into nearby lymph nodes, but not to distant organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling how she felt about the devastating diagnosis at the time, Byrd said: 'Of course, when you hear 'cancer,' you're thinking death or that it's something that you're not going to survive. That's what I was thinking. I was 38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Byrd, pictured in 2018 before her cancer battle, hopes her story will inspire other young people to go and checked out as soon as they feel something isn't quite right with their bodies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I started thinking about my son - he was only two years old, and my daughter and my husband - I don't know what life would be if God took me right now. I started praying and asking God, 'What do you need me to do?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had so many things that I wanted to still accomplish. I have to be here for my children and my husband. I had recently lost my mom and I knew how bad it felt. I know they need me. So I had to fight. I had to.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After having a surgery to remove the majority of the tumor, Byrd underwent chemotherapy in October 2022, which saw her weight plummet further to around 140lbs as she was hit by major fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also lost her appetite as the chemotherapy made 'everything taste like metal'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following chemotherapy, Byrd started radiation which took her to March 2023 and she had another surgery to remove the rest of her tumor around four months later.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was at that point, the medical team declared Byrd cancer-free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had a temporary ostomy bag fitted for about a year while she healed from the surgery and one more round of chemotherapy lasting for three months to ensure the disease didn't return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Throughout her cancer journey, Byrd says her family has been her rock and her husband 'wore all of the hats when I needed him to'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she is now cancer-free, there are some side effects that will never leave her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mom-of-two says: 'Even now, after having everything done and my cancer being in remission, I still have the abdominal pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I still feel like I have to go to the restroom every five minutes and nothing happens as far as my bowels moving. They say that won't ever go away for me because of where the tumor was.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Byrd hopes her story will inspire other young people to go and checked out as soon as they feel something isn't quite right with their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society recommends that adults who are at an average risk for colon cancer begin screening at age 45 and then receive a colonoscopy once every 10 years until age 75 if they are in generally good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, for those with a family history of colorectal cancer or other risk factors, screening may need to begin as early as age 40 or even earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Byrd concludes: 'If you have a family member that had colon cancer, even if it's not in your immediate family, advocate for yourself at the doctor's office and tell them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm happy that I went to the doctor, and I did not wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cancer is something that you can't predict. We only have one life to live. So if my journey can help somebody else, then I'm here for it, because we all deserve to be here and enjoy life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 14:41:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQdXczVGNRM2V3UWk3MElfdkw2ZUZtZ19oVmdBRjltblBiZUNjOWJ3Z20zcDRyZGp0Z1hoVDl1UV9tanVBVGtMdTRuWlFjM3I5N2wxSUt1S3NYazRiaTRWaG9SN3pfTHpBOGJEdlVQcDZqMktCWmRISWE1UlkxaXM3bThKRlJTMm1nc1ItUkFuNWZ5YXBxd2lQTFI5bFdhYUpWQ0HSAacBQVVfeXFMTS1hbnRoRkZob2NjRnpyRUd6YjdUOW16YWxpVy1xY3JHczMyVmtvVlZQRTBYTHJVcGxhZ3h5aUp3WjAtaTJOZGx3dTNSQmloZFdXc2dLZHEycHg3RncyNlNDYm1HTi1YS0hnTkpBTXY0Y3IzcFNUaXE4Zzk5ZGpabUdsX21LX2FuN1pHdFo0ZFcxM2xCNEZRZi1qMjZreDFNOHhiUUFtbDg</guid></item><item><title>Transplanted pig kidney removed after functioning in living patient for more than four months - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxNZ3k2UHM2TTFHTVRKM0YybVdRY3RGSGx2Nzh0R1hTeFpfTGtuRkVJLUdnQ3pJNE90UU1XbVltZW1aN3k3a2NHZzlsTFRON1FiTW1YU3psVk9sblV4czdDT3FvTXYyUnFLOEhGZHlfZUd1VGVKZlJEUlprZkVpdFhRLTFycVVTM0ZBdERxSVJncHR2SXpOcHZvVVVYem83X3o2YVE2UG52QdIBngFBVV95cUxQVWtGZHhuZE9FOGU5c1kxZExvRWxVQThKc2RoMFA0XzFZem9ZMGRnRXZQNTFMTUFLVTVROVRCaDV1cF9LZzAtY1U3ZWxRQWFSMl9uZTJaZVJselVaY01MNnYyak5QTGJJTVVhNkJXNWx1TW5wS1YxbzdDNUY5MzBaWnJ2al9WOWZoamI3LTlxejZOb3lpdm15dElEdERtQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            A genetically engineered pig kidney helped Towana Looney enjoy 130 days without the need for dialysis before the organ was removed last week. It’s the longest a human has ever lived with a pig organ,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;marking another step forward in the burgeoning field of xenotransplantation, or the practice of transplanting animal organs into humans.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00043b6mkxerxdbn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Looney, a 53-year-old-woman from Alabama, had been on dialysis for nine years before she received the pig kidney transplant in late November, becoming only the &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/9teig" target="_blank"&gt;third person&lt;/a&gt; to receive a kidney from a gene-edited pig while alive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00053b6mg4h29mw0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She left the hospital 11 days after surgery at NYU Langone Transplant Institute, staying at an apartment near the hospital so she could get checkups every day. But medical complications developed after months of stability, leading to the difficult decision to remove the organ on April 4.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00063b6m0c7hbs89@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In early April, she had a reduction in renal function due to acute rejection. What triggered the rejection episode after a long period of stability is being actively investigated, but it followed a lowering of her immunosuppression regimen to treat an infection unrelated to the pig kidney,” Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute and chair of NYU Langone Health’s surgery department, said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00073b6m9oambug9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The decision was made by Ms. Looney and her doctors that the safest intervention would be to remove the kidney and return to dialysis rather than giving additional immunosuppression. This preserves future possibilities for transplantation for her as knowledge and innovations progress,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00083b6mgig5vddw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            United Therapeutics Corporation, the biotech company that developed the modified pig kidney – known as a UKidney – celebrated the bravery and enthusiasm Looney has shown throughout the xenotransplantation journey.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9cox7ur00003b6mvmz3si5d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One of the biggest challenges for transplant recipients – human-to-human or pig-to-human – is the prevention and management of infections while simultaneously balancing the level of immunosuppression medications required to prevent rejection, especially in the first months after surgery,” the company said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9cp465400033b6mfrqhvyiy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We will learn more about the circumstances that led to removal of the UKidney, but current evidence suggests that the UKidney functioned well up until the time of rejection, which appears to have occurred due to a reduction in immunosuppression while treating infection unrelated to the xenokidney,” they said. “We expect physicians at NYU will share their findings in a peer-reviewed publication in the future.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00093b6mcg7aamto@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Looney donated a kidney to help save her mother’s life in 1999 but later developed kidney failure after her remaining kidney was damaged by preeclampsia, a serious pregnancy complication involving persistent high blood pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000a3b6mttmlsu6x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After years on the waitlist for an organ transplant, she began to develop problems associated with chronic dependence on dialysis. Without a donor match, she would die – but the complications she had developed made it more difficult to find one. When she heard about the option to try a pig kidney transplantation, she jumped at the chance to try it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000b3b6mau83kefp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Without a pathway to receiving a human kidney, she decided a gene-edited pig kidney was worth a try, and a lot of people rallied around her decision, including her husband and family,” Montgomery said at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000c3b6mso9vynt5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Looney is now back home in Alabama and says she’s grateful for the opportunity she had to participate in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000d3b6mbn6030iu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For the first time since 2016, I enjoyed time with friends and family without planning around dialysis treatments,” she said in a statement. “Though the outcome is not what anyone wanted, I know a lot was learned from my 130 days with a pig kidney – and that this can help and inspire many others in their journey to overcome kidney disease. I remain thankful to all of the doctors and researchers at NYU Langone for all they are doing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000e3b6mxgchhrwr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 90,000 people in the United States are on the waitlist to receive a kidney transplant, according to &lt;a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/view-data-reports/national-data/" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, accounting for the vast majority of people waiting to receive an organ donation. The average wait time for a kidney is &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/kidney-transplant-waitlist#:~:text=Once%20you%20are%20on%20the%20transplant%20waiting%20list%2C%20you%20may,Where%20you%20live" target="_blank"&gt;three to five years&lt;/a&gt; at most centers, and about 13 people die each day &lt;a href="https://unos.org/media-resources/releases/over-30-kidney-donors-and-advocates-to-celebrate-world-kidney-day-from-the-top-of-mount-kilimanjaro/#:~:text=Roughly%2013%20people%20die%20each,as%2075%20through%20tissue%20donation." target="_blank"&gt;waiting&lt;/a&gt;.

            Dialysis – a procedure to help remove waste and extra fluid from the blood – can be helpful in the short term but can do only 10% to 15% of what a &lt;a href="https://www.kidneyfund.org/treatments/dialysis#:~:text=It%20helps%20your%20body%20remove,what%20a%20normal%20kidney%20does." target="_blank"&gt;healthy kidney&lt;/a&gt; does, and people on dialysis have a 50% chance of dying in the five years after they start the treatment, &lt;a href="https://pharm.ucsf.edu/kidney/need/statistics#:~:text=After%20one%20year%20of%20treatment,about%2080%25%20after%205%20years." target="_blank"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000g3b6mmdjiqier@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Food and Drug Administration allows doctors to transplant organs from pigs into humans under what’s commonly known as “compassionate use,” which permits use of an experimental therapy or procedure if “comparable or satisfactory” options aren’t available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000h3b6mq95j2vho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pigs’ organs are similar to humans’, and the speed of pigs’ reproduction means their organs can be procured quickly. Scientists can edit the genes of the pig to reduce the risk that a human body will reject its organ.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000i3b6mpns3f4sk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Looney was the first to receive a kidney with 10 gene edits, and United Therapeutics &lt;a href="https://ir.unither.com/press-releases/2025/02-03-2025-120011819" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in February that it was cleared by the FDA to use this type of pig kidney in the first human clinical trials to study xenotransplantation. The company says they are in regular contact with the FDA about this and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;expect to perform the first of six initial transplants in people with end-stage kidney disease in the middle of 2025, with the intent of expanding the trial to a total of 50 patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000j3b6m4c5zh75u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some experts foresee pig kidney transplant becoming an established option for patients within a decade, a major advancement that would be possible because of people like Looney.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000k3b6mdbhpepre@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Towana’s willingness to endeavor into the unknown to help solve the nation’s organ shortage crisis will impact many more lives after her. We celebrate her tremendous courage and sacrifice,” Montgomery said. “She lived with a pig kidney longer than any other human in history, and the field has learned a great deal from her. Her contribution has furthered the hope and promise of genetically engineered pig organs as an alternative source to human organs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9cp8pk0000b3b6m4f9ptp9i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            United Therapeutics echoed the same sentiment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9cpfjak000l3b6msrf7mkxu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Mrs. Looney’s bravery has enabled major advancements in the field of xenotransplantation and adds to the foundational insights made possible by the contributions of other patients. Her case will continue to add to the scientific community’s understanding of xenotransplantation, from the initial transplant procedure to the post-transplant management of the xenograft,” the company said. “We keep Mrs. Looney and her family in our thoughts, and we wish her a speedy recovery.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

In contrast, strong spatial memory skills, such as understanding where objects are located in space, may protect against PTSD symptoms, particularly in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers surveyed over 1,000 trauma-exposed adults and students, revealing distinct roles of visual and spatial imagery in PTSD vulnerability. These findings could inform future strategies to identify and support at-risk individuals before PTSD develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vivid Visual Imagery:&lt;/strong&gt; Strong visual memory is linked to more PTSD symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spatial Resilience:&lt;/strong&gt; Better spatial memory may reduce PTSD symptoms, especially in men.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Imagery traits could help identify those most at risk after trauma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Baycrest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trauma alone doesn’t cause posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – how we process and imagine it plays a key role, according to new research. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent Baycrest study suggests that having a vivid visual imagery is linked to a greater risk of developing PTSD, in which debilitating mental health symptoms persist for more than one month following exposure to traumatic or highly stressful events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is among the largest in providing high-quality evidence of this link and examining visual and spatial imagery as distinct features of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of us are exposed to trauma at some point, but only a minority of us develop PTSD,” said Dr. Brian Levine, Senior Scientist at the Rotman Research Institute, part of the Baycrest Academy for Research and Education (BARE), and senior author on this study, titled “The Curse of Imagery: Trait Object and Spatial Imagery Differentially Relate to Symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder” and published recently in &lt;em&gt;Clinical Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research will help us understand why some are resilient to this disorder whereas others are at risk. Our results could help improve treatments for individuals who are struggling with this disorder, improving their quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, led by Dr. Ryan Yeung, a postdoctoral fellow at BARE, 806 adults who reported having been exposed to trauma completed a series of online questionnaires about their mental health, trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and visual and spatial imagery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then examined the relationship between PTSD symptoms and the strength of participants’ visual and spatial imagery. The findings were confirmed in a separate sample of 493 undergraduate students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual imagery refers to physical features of scenes that evoke a sense of vividness, such as shapes and colours, while spatial imagery refers to the location of elements within scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main study findings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;A more vivid visual imagery was linked to more PTSD symptoms across age and gender.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A stronger spatial imagery was associated with fewer PTSD symptoms, although this relationship was confined to men in the undergraduate sample.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ability to vividly re-experience past events is usually beneficial, but our results indicate that it can make it harder to overcome the psychological after-effects of distressing or traumatic events,” said Dr. Levine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the other hand, the better you are at navigating and recognizing where things fit in space, including in the ‘space’ of your life, the less likely you are to develop PTSD.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yeung added, “Considering individual differences in these aspects of memory could help us predict who may be at risk following exposure to trauma and provide them with the necessary support as early as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future studies, the research team will examine these effects in longitudinal studies by testing paramedic students before and after occupational exposure to traumatic events. Additional studies will be conducted to determine the impact of gender and biological sex on imagery and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this PTSD and visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#57393936343221243c3e7a3b363e25331735362e342532242379382530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natasha Nacevski-Laird&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://baycrest.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Baycrest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Natasha Nacevski-Laird – Baycrest&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21677026251315118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Curse of Imagery: Trait Object and Spatial Imagery Differentially Relate to Symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder&lt;/a&gt;” by Brian Levine et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clinical Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Curse of Imagery: Trait Object and Spatial Imagery Differentially Relate to Symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagery is integral to autobiographical memory (AM). Past work has highlighted the benefits of high trait imagery on episodic AM, including faster, more detailed, and more vivid retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these advantages may come with drawbacks: Following potentially traumatic events, strong visual imagery could promote the intrusions characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, spatial imagery could schematize potentially traumatic events, countering vivid recollection and reducing distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined relationships between trait object imagery (e.g., color, shape), spatial imagery (e.g., abstract representations, locations), and PTSD symptoms in two independent samples: trauma-exposed adults (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 806) and undergraduates (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 493). As predicted, higher object imagery was associated with more PTSD symptoms in both samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher spatial-schematic processing was associated with fewer PTSD symptoms in the trauma-exposed sample, although this effect was confined to men in the undergraduate sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different forms of imagery have different—or even opposing—relationships with episodic AM that affect PTSD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:40:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE93cHd2TmxMNlpYUFJydzVlX0NsQ0ZHS3pqYzdsUmlaNlpGMWZHb0NKRlFUY0JyY3RoWFdwTS1ORm5Dc19wbXhzVjZJdWVVaUtmVDcySTM1ZWFEdTJDdFMyZmRsVy0</guid></item><item><title>Fentanyl overdose inhibitor Narcan now available for free in Georgia - AJC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxPVFlRSzh0YThpS0lSWHFJdFdIdDJkZU1PN1FNMjZDX3k4RWtUWnJFR2JXX3NPYnc1TDl5Zk91ZmVxVjZyYllUWFNFSGxQWGJBaFZlbXBsTENtNlRZTWh6ZjBjU2lNNUdxdFRkMmxONWYtb2k0aUZ6dmNIWmJBMTRQczM4bVhNelMzeUZ0SHZNNmxkSTd0d1VBTnVoeHAwLTRYZjlqYjREbHd6MFFUMndKNVlVSExyYkRlb3AtYU9JaEdyU1FlMElod2plUWxpUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-contentElements" data-start-index="5"&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="6"&gt;Katz opened the door, detected a faint pulse, and shot the nasal opioid-reversal drug naloxone (known by the brand name Narcan) into the man’s nose.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;While healthy aging is highly individual, a healthy and balanced lifestyle can help you maximize your later years. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drinking soothing tea, powering down electronics and taking an after-dinner walk are simple—and accessible—ways you can support your health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s never too late (or too early) to adopt healthy aging habits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of us aspire to age gracefully and—more importantly—healthily. And while it can feel like many factors are out of our control, such as genetics, you have more power over &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;you age than you may think. “Your daily lifestyle habits play a big role in shaping how you feel today, and how you age in the future,” says &lt;a href="https://www.mmweightloss.com/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwktO_BhBrEiwAV70jXoKBmyUy87yDnB29HEqSbVUfHDtVmbiJitz6mwYcUDxFj0UIOpnDhBoC_TMQAvD_BwE" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Suneye Koohsari, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified obesity medicine and family medicine physician. “Prioritizing a balanced, healthy lifestyle can boost your energy, support mental clarity and enhance your mood, all while promoting longevity and a higher quality of life as you age.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s never too late to start adopting healthy habits. However, the earlier you can start making these adjustments to your lifestyle, the better. “Healthy habits formed now are the building blocks for aging,” says &lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/weight-loss-nutritionists#courtney-pelitera" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Courtney Pelitera, M.S., R.D.&lt;/a&gt; These habits can help fend off acute illnesses, such as the flu, and potentially protect against chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sleep is a critical component of healthy aging, which is why so many of the tips ahead focus on what you can do after 5 p.m. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7527638/how-to-sleep-better/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Getting quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; each night (preferably seven to nine hours) helps bolster the immune system, reduces chronic inflammation, improves muscle recovery and repair from exercise (and injury), and enhances cognition—just to name a few benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Take your health into your own hands with these tips from Koohsari and Pelitera.
&lt;/p&gt;

Sip on Decaf Tea for Better Sleep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no shortage of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044312/is-tea-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tea benefits&lt;/a&gt; or tea options to choose from. But before tucking yourself into bed, you may want to steep a cup of herbal tea such as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-tea-to-help-reduce-stress-8773678" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chamomile tea&lt;/a&gt;. Research suggests you may want to exclusively drink decaf beverages up to six hours before bedtime, as caffeine can disrupt sleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “After 5 p.m., consider sipping on chamomile tea, as it can help promote muscle relaxation and better sleep,” Pelitera says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-take-a-walk-after-dinner"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Take a Walk After Dinner  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Incorporating a walk into your after-dinner, pre-bedtime routine can be a game-changer for your overall health. Perhaps the most immediate benefit is that it supports healthy digestion, especially after a big meal, Pelitera says. “With so much new research coming out about the gut microbiome and its effects on our overall health, we now know that good digestion is essential for healthy aging,” she adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Going for a walk, or doing gentle exercises like yoga, can help boost motility in your intestines, enabling them to break down food more efficiently. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Implementing a daily evening walk may provide other healthy-aging benefits too. Koohsari points out that the findings from a 2022 meta-analysis revealed that people who did light-intensity walking significantly improved blood sugar levels compared to those who didn’t take breaks from prolonged sitting.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Better blood sugar regulation can help reduce the risk of developing insulin resistance over time,” Koohsari says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Develop a Stress-Relieving Bedtime Routine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Mental health is a vital component of overall well-being, and finding healthy outlets to manage stress—such as journaling, deep breathing, meditation, yoga or talking with a therapist or trusted loved one—can make a meaningful difference,” Koohsari says. “Prioritizing stress management supports both your emotional resilience and long-term physical health.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Following consistent &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/i-tried-a-doctor-recommended-sleep-routine-for-2-weeks-8763725" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt; rituals each night, like the ones Koohsari specified, can help prepare your body for restful sleep. Consider also dimming the lights, playing calming music, smelling soothing essential oils and powering down electronics and other screens shortly before sleep. Research has shown that exposure to blue light, which is emitted from the sun and screens, can interfere with your sleep-wake cycle, as it suppresses production of melatonin (aka the sleep hormone).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-stay-hydratedbut-stop-fluids-1-hour-before-bed"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Stay Hydrated—but Stop Fluids 1 Hour Before Bed &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
“Many clients I work with struggle with having to get up at night to use the bathroom, once or several times,” Pelitera says. If you struggle with this too, and you often go to bed around 10 p.m., consider enjoying a soothing cup of tea or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292203/tart-cherry-juice-benefits/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tart cherry juice&lt;/a&gt; no later than 8 or 8:30 p.m. This gives you plenty of time to use the restroom before hitting the hay. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “That being said, one of the biggest issues the aging population experiences is staying hydrated,” Pelitera says. “That’s because our sense of thirst diminishes as we age.” Throughout the day, aim to sip on at least &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7825445/how-much-water-should-you-drink-by-the-numbers/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;48 to 64 ounces of fluids daily&lt;/a&gt;, she adds. “Keeping a water bottle on hand and filled up can help remind you to drink it throughout the day.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-skip-the-nightcap"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Skip the Nightcap &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Sometimes, there’s nothing better than sipping on a glass of wine after a long workday. But, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-and-your-health-11685623" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;current evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests there’s &lt;em&gt;no &lt;/em&gt;safe amount of alcohol to consume for healthy aging. “Alcohol can negatively affect the body in multiple ways—from short-term impacts on sleep quality and mood to long-term risks such as cardiovascular disease and increased risk of cancers, including breast, colorectal and liver cancer,” Koohsari says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-enjoy-a-sleep-supporting-late-night-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Enjoy a Sleep-Supporting Late-Night Snack &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;

A great example of this is yogurt, with or without toppings. I love adding a little peanut butter and a couple of chocolate chips to make it a sweet bite.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7891068/best-worst-late-night-snacks-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;balanced snacks&lt;/a&gt; after 5 p.m. can help slow digestion and prevent blood sugar spikes and dips throughout the night—which can stave off nighttime hunger that could disrupt restorative sleep, Pelitera explains: “This may be especially important for those with diabetes, especially those whose glucose levels drop overnight.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may not even need a snack if your dinner is rich in protein and fiber, which can help you sustain energy for evening tasks (think: chores, work, playing with kids, etc.) and help you feel full longer, Koohsari says. “Fiber-rich foods—such as fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains—not only promote gut health, but also improve blood sugar control, lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no one right way or strategy to promote healthy aging. In fact, there’s a multitude of ways you can promote long-term health benefits. A common thread in the many approaches to healthy aging is incorporating habits that can help encourage quality sleep. Sleep reduces inflammation in the body, which can help protect you from a host of chronic diseases. Adopting good sleep hygiene rituals and skipping that nighttime glass of alcohol are just two ways you can rest easier at night and support your overall health. “It’s not just about adding years to your life, it’s also about maximizing the number of years lived in optimal health,” Koohsari says.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple blood test costing less than $10 could prevent hundreds of heart attacks and other adverse cardiac events per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troponin is a protein found in heart muscle cells that if detected in the blood stream means the heart has been damaged in some way: a key indicator of cardiovascular disease risk with greater predictive power than cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A troponin detection test that can be administered along with other simple blood tests could alert hundreds of patients to their higher risk of heart attack and stroke, allowing them to alter their lifestyle or even start taking statins, in advance of an adverse cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept was demonstrated in a paper published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The authors showed that adding cardiac troponin levels to existing risk factors such as smoking status, cholesterol, diabetes presence, and blood pressure increased the predictive powers of these screenings—done after CVD events or in advance of a statin prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, in their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735109725004164?dgcid=author" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 62,000 Britons with a 15-year follow-up, one additional CVD event would be prevented for every 408 and 473 individuals screened when troponin was added, a result of troponin being a good indicator of so-called “silent” heart damage that could lead to a CVD event in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study also found adding troponin tests meant that up to 8% of people classified as intermediate risk were changed to high-risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Troponin, even in the normal range, is a powerful indicator of silent heart muscle damage,” &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/07/simple-blood-test-help-prevent-thousands-heart-attacks-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Anoop Shah, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine and lead author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0"&gt;In the past six months, two babies in Louisiana have died of pertussis, the disease commonly known as whooping cough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1"&gt;Washington state recently announced its first confirmed death from pertussis in more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2"&gt;Idaho and South Dakota each reported a death this year, and Oregon last year reported two as well as its highest number of cases since 1950.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0"&gt;While much of the country is focused on the spiraling measles outbreak concentrated in the small, dusty towns of West Texas, cases of pertussis have skyrocketed by more than 1,500% nationwide since hitting a recent low in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Deaths tied to the disease are also up, hitting 10 last year, compared with about two to four in previous years. Cases are on track to exceed that total this year.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Cases had been decreasing in the years before the COVID-19 outbreak and dropped further when schools were closed in response to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0"&gt;Doctors, researchers and public health experts warn that the measles outbreak, which has grown to more than 600 cases, may just be the beginning. They say outbreaks of preventable diseases could get much worse with falling vaccination rates and the Trump administration slashing spending on the country’s public health infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0"&gt;National rates for four major vaccines, which had held relatively steady in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic, have fallen significantly since, according to a ProPublica analysis of the most recent federal kindergarten vaccination data. Not only have vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella fallen, but federal data shows that so have those for pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and polio.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0"&gt;In addition, public health experts say that growing pockets of unvaccinated populations across the country place babies and young children in danger should there be a resurgence of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1"&gt;Many medical authorities view measles, which is especially contagious, as the canary in the coal mine, but pertussis cases may also be a warning, albeit one that has attracted far less attention.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0"&gt;“This is not just measles,” said Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor in New York City and author of the book “Booster Shots: The Urgent Lessons of Measles and the Uncertain Future of Children’s Health.” “It’s a bright-red warning light.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0"&gt;At least 36 states have witnessed a drop in rates for at least one key vaccine from the 2013-14 to the 2023-24 school years. And half of states have seen an across-the-board decline in all four vaccination rates. Wisconsin, Utah and Alaska have experienced some of the most precipitous drops during that time, with declines of more than 10 percentage points in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0"&gt;“There is a direct correlation between vaccination rates and vaccine-preventable disease outbreak rates,” said a spokesperson for the Utah Department of Health and Human Services. “Decreases in vaccination rates will likely lead to more outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in Utah.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0"&gt;But statewide figures alone don’t provide a full picture. Tucked inside each state are counties and communities with far lower vaccination rates that drive outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0"&gt;For example, the whooping cough vaccination rate for kindergartners in Washington state in 2023-24 was 90.2%, slightly below the U.S. rate of 92.3%, federal data shows. But the statewide rate for children 19 to 35 months last year was 65.4%, according to state data. In four counties, that rate was in the 30% range. In one county, it was below 12%.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0"&gt;“My concern is that there is going to be a large outbreak of not just measles, but other vaccine-preventable diseases as well, that’s going to end up causing a lot of harm, and possibly deaths in children and young adults,” said Dr. Anna Durbin, a professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who has spent her career studying vaccines. “And it’s completely preventable.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0"&gt;The dramatic cuts to public health funding and staffing could heighten the risk. And the elevation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, to the secretary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, several experts said, has only compounded matters.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0"&gt;The Trump administration has eliminated 20,000 jobs at agencies within HHS, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nation’s public health agency. And late last month, the administration also cut $11 billion from state and local public health agencies on the front lines of protecting Americans from outbreaks; the administration said the money was no longer necessary after the end of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0"&gt;Several city and county public health officials had to move quickly to lay off nurses, epidemiologists and disease inspectors. Some ceased vaccination clinics, halted wastewater surveillance programs and even terminated a contract with the courier service that transports specimens to state labs to test for infectious diseases. One Minnesota public health agency, which had provided 1,400 shots for children at clinics last year, immediately stopped those clinics when the directive arrived, court records show.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0"&gt;A federal judge temporarily barred HHS from enacting the cuts, but the ruling, which came more than a week after the grants were terminated, was too late for programs that had already been canceled and employees who had already been laid off. Lawyers for HHS have asked the judge to reconsider her decision in light of a recent Supreme Court ruling that allowed the Department of Education to terminate grants for teacher training while that case is being argued in lower courts. The judge in the HHS case has not yet ruled on the motion.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0"&gt;But in tiny storefronts and cozy homes, at school fairs and gas stations, many residents in West Texas, near where the measles outbreak has taken hold, appear unfazed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.1"&gt;“I don’t need a vaccine,” one man sitting on his porch said recently. “I don’t get sick.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.2"&gt;“It’s measles. It’s been around forever,” said a woman making her way to her car. “I don’t think it’s a big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.3"&gt;When asked why they weren’t planning on vaccinating their baby, a husband walking alongside his wife who was 27 weeks pregnant simply said, “It’s God’s will.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span class="attribution__caption"&gt;Seminole last month. Many residents in West Texas appear unfazed by the measles outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0"&gt;In word and deed, Kennedy has sown doubt about immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0"&gt;In response to the measles outbreak, Kennedy initially said in a column he wrote for Fox News that the decision to vaccinate is a “personal one.” HHS sent doses of vitamin A alongside vaccines to Texas, and Kennedy praised the use of cod liver oil. Only the vaccine prevents measles.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0"&gt;About a week later, in an interview on Fox News, while Kennedy encouraged vaccines, he said he was a “freedom of choice person.” At the same time, he emphasized the risks of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0"&gt;Only after the second measles death in Texas did &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414"&gt;Kennedy post&lt;/a&gt; on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0"&gt;But even that is not the unequivocal message that the head of HHS should be sending, said Ratner, the infectious diseases doctor in New York. It is, he said, a tepid recommendation at best.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0"&gt;“It gives the impression that these things are equivalent, that you can choose one or the other, and that is disingenuous,” he said. “We don’t have a treatment for measles. We have vitamin A, which we can give to kids with measles, that decreases but doesn’t eliminate the risk of severe outcomes. It doesn’t do anything for prevention of measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0"&gt;In the past, Kennedy has been a fierce critic of the vaccine. In a foreword to a 2021 book on measles released by the nonprofit that he founded, Kennedy wrote, “Measles outbreaks have been fabricated to create fear that in turn forces government officials to ‘do something.’ They then inflict unnecessary and risky vaccines on millions of children for the sole purpose of fattening industry profits.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0"&gt;A spokesperson for HHS said, “Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine — he is pro-safety, pro-transparency and pro-accountability.” Kennedy, the spokesperson said, responded to the measles outbreak with “clear guidance that vaccines are the most effective way to prevent measles” and under his leadership, the CDC updated its pediatric patient management protocol for measles to include physician-administered vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0"&gt;Kennedy, the spokesperson added, “is uniquely qualified to lead HHS at this pivotal moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0"&gt;Late last month, leaders at the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/measles-vaccine-rfk-cdc-report"&gt;ordered staff to bury a risk assessment&lt;/a&gt; that emphasized the need for vaccines in response to the measles outbreak — in spite of the fact the CDC has long &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html"&gt;promoted vaccinations&lt;/a&gt; as a cornerstone of public health. While a CDC spokesperson acknowledged that vaccines offer the best protection from measles, she also repeated a line Kennedy had used: “The decision to vaccinate is a personal one.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0"&gt;Among the approximately 2,400 jobs eliminated at the CDC was a team in the Immunization Services Division that partnered with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-equity/php/about/partnering-for-vaccine-equity-partners.html"&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt; to promote access to and confidence in vaccines in communities where coverage lagged.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0"&gt;The National Institutes of Health, which is also under HHS, recently ended funding for studies that examine vaccine hesitancy. In early April, researchers, the American Public Health Association and one of the largest unions in the country sued the NIH and its director, Jay Bhattacharya, along with HHS and Kennedy, alleging they terminated grants “without scientifically-valid explanation or cause.” The government hasn’t filed a response in the case.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0"&gt;The NIH cancellation notices stated that the agency’s policy was not to prioritize research that focuses on “gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0"&gt;“These grants are being canceled in the midst of an outbreak, a vaccine-preventable outbreak,” said Rupali Limaye, an associate professor at George Mason University who has spent the past decade studying vaccine hesitancy. “We need to better understand why people are not accepting vaccines now more than ever. This outbreak is still spreading.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0"&gt;That vaccines prevent diseases is settled science. For decades, there was a societal understanding that getting vaccinated benefited not only the person who got the shot, but also the broader community, especially babies or people with weakened immune systems, like those in chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0"&gt;An investment in public health and a sustained, large-scale approach to vaccines is what helped the country declare the elimination of the measles in 2000, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, the CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0"&gt;But she has watched both deteriorate over the last few months. Nearly every morning since notices of the federal funding cuts began going out to local public health agencies, she has woken up to texts from panicked public health workers. She has led daily calls with local health departments and sat in on multiple emergency board meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0"&gt;Freeman has compiled a list of more than 100 direct consequences of the cuts, including one rural health department in the Midwest that can no longer carry out immunization services. That’s vital because there are no hospitals in the county and all public health duties fall to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0"&gt;“It’s relentless,” she said. “It feels like a barrage and assault on public health.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

        &lt;span class="attribution__caption"&gt;Vaccines were available at the health department in Lubbock, Texas, last month.&lt;/span&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0"&gt;More than 1,600 miles away from Washington, D.C., in Lubbock, Texas, the director of the city’s health department, Katherine Wells, sighed last week when she saw the most recent measles numbers. She would have to alert her staff to work late again.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0"&gt;“There’s a lot of cases,” she said, “and we continue to see more and more cases.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0"&gt;She didn’t know it at the time, but that night would mark the state’s second measles death this year. An earlier death in February was the country’s first in a decade. Both children were not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0"&gt;Kennedy said he traveled to Gaines County to comfort the family who lost their 8-year-old daughter and while there met with the family of the 6-year-old girl who died in February.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0"&gt;He also visited with two local doctors he described as “extraordinary healers,” he said in his post on X. The men, he claimed, have “treated and healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children” using aerosolized budesonide — typically used to prevent symptoms of asthma — and clarithromycin — an antibiotic. Medical experts said neither is an effective measles treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0"&gt;State health officials have traced about two-thirds of the measles cases in Texas to Gaines County, which sits on the western edge of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.1"&gt;Seminole, one of the county’s only two incorporated towns, has emerged as the epicenter of the outbreak, with Tina Siemens acting as a community ambassador of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0"&gt;Siemens, a tall woman with glasses and a short blonde bob, runs a museum that combines the area’s Native American history and Mennonite community with traditional skills like calligraphy and canning fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0"&gt;On a recent Tuesday, atop the museum’s dark coffee table, notes scrawled onto white paper listed the latest shipments of vitamin C and Alaskan cod liver oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.1"&gt;The supplies, Siemens said, were for one of the local doctors who met with Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.2"&gt;As measles tears through the community, Siemens said families have to decide whether to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.3"&gt;“In America, we have a choice,” she said, echoing Kennedy’s messaging. “The cod liver oil that was flown in, the vitamin C that was flown in, was a great help.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0"&gt;Dr. Philip Huang, director and health authority for the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, is working to keep the measles outbreak from reaching his community, just five hours east of Seminole. He wrote letters to the public school superintendents and leaders of private schools that had large numbers of unvaccinated or undervaccinated students offering to set up mobile vaccine clinics for them.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0"&gt;“Overall, the rates can look OK,” he said, “but when you’ve got these pockets of unvaccinated, that’s where the vulnerability lies.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0"&gt;Huang has had to lay off 11 full-time employees, 10 temporary workers and cancel more than 50 vaccine clinics following the HHS cuts. The systemic dismantling of the CDC and other federal health agencies, he said, will have a grave and lasting impact.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0"&gt;“This is setting us back decades,” Huang said. “Everyone should be extremely concerned about what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="62.0"&gt;Across the country, pediatricians are petrified, said Dr. Susan Kressly, who serves as president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the largest professional organization of pediatricians in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0"&gt;“Many of us are losing sleep,” Kressly said. “If we lose that progress, children will pay the price.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.0"&gt;She’s carefully watching the spread of several vaccine-preventable diseases, including an increase in whooping cases that far outpace the typical peaks seen every few years. Although the whooping cough vaccine isn’t as effective as the ones for measles and protection wanes over time, the CDC says it remains the best way to prevent the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="65.0"&gt;Babies under the age of 1 are among the most at risk of severe complications from whooping cough, including slowed or stopped breathing and pneumonia, according to the CDC. About one-third of infants who get whooping cough end up in the hospital. Newborns are especially vulnerable because the CDC doesn’t recommend the first shot until two months. That’s why experts recommend pregnant mothers and anyone who will be around the baby to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0"&gt;The number of whooping cough cases dropped significantly during the pandemic, but it exploded in recent years. In 2021, the CDC reported 2,116 cases; last year, there were 35,435.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="67.0"&gt;The numbers this year appear set to eclipse 2024. So far in 2025, 7,111 cases have been reported, which is more than double this time last year. Cases tend to spike in the summer and fall, which adds to experts’ concern about high numbers so early in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0"&gt;States on the Pacific Coast and in the Midwest have reported the most cases this year, with Washington leading the country with 742 cases so far, more than five times as many as at this time last year.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0"&gt;The Washington child who died of whooping cough had no underlying medical conditions, according to a spokesperson for the Spokane Regional Health District. The death was announced in February but occurred in November.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.0"&gt;While Washington’s overall vaccination rate for whooping cough has remained relatively steady over the last decade at around 90%, pockets of low vaccination rates have allowed the disease to take root and put the wider community at risk, said Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett, a pediatrician and chief health officer of the Washington State Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.0"&gt;This is the time to strengthen the public health system, he said, to build trust in those areas and make it easier for children to get their routine vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.1"&gt;“But instead, we’re seeing the exact opposite happen,” he said. “We’re weakening our public health system, and that will put us on a path towards more illness and shorter lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0"&gt;Washington was one of 23 states and the District of Columbia that sued HHS and Kennedy following the $11 billion cuts, which rescinded approximately $118 million from the state. Doing so, the state said in court records, would impact 150 full-time employees and cause an immediate reduction in the agency’s ability to respond to outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0"&gt;Washington’s Care-A-Van, a mobile health clinic that travels across the state to provide vaccinations, conduct blood pressure screenings and distribute opioid overdose kits, was a key element in the department’s vaccination efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.0"&gt;But that, too, has been diminished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.1"&gt;An alert on the department’s website cataloged the impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.2"&gt;“Attention,” it began.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0"&gt;As a result of the unexpected decision to terminate grant funding, “all Care-A-Van operations have been paused indefinitely, including the cancellation of more than 104 upcoming clinics across the state.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="78.0"&gt;The department had anticipated providing approximately 2,000 childhood vaccines as part of that effort.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="79.0"&gt;The frustration came through in Kwan-Gett’s voice. Many people think that federal cuts to public health mean shrinking the federal workforce, he said, but those clawbacks also get passed down to states and cities and counties. The less federal support that trickles down to the local level, the less protected communities will be.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="80.0"&gt;“It really breaks my heart,” he said, “when I see children suffering from preventable diseases like whooping cough and measles when we have the tools to prevent them.”&lt;/p&gt;

Sixty percent of people surveyed by the Pew Research Center said they &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/02/05/how-americans-feel-about-the-satisfactions-and-stresses-of-modern-life/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;sometimes felt too busy to enjoy life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some of the stress around scheduling is out of our control, but there are things we can all do to feel more in charge of our time, Guillebeau said. I asked him and other experts for tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="css-15h6bi9 e1gnsphs0" id="link-433af8cd"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Abandon the idea that you’ll ever be all caught up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Your to-do list will never end, said Thomas Curran, an associate professor of psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science and the author of “The Perfection Trap: Embracing the Power of Good Enough.” So build your tolerance for leaving that list unfinished, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Kennedy Jr. called for people to get the measles vaccine while in the same breath falsely claiming it hasn’t been “safety tested” and its protection is short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist now overseeing federal health agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had shied away from a full-throated endorsement of measles vaccinations, instead claiming the vaccine is the “most effective way” to prevent the virus’ spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2U0csKvqMY" target="_blank"&gt;In an interview&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday with CBS News, Kennedy said the Trump administration was focused on finding ways to treat people who choose not to get vaccinated. However, there &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374862" target="_blank"&gt;are no approved treatments&lt;/a&gt; for measles, which &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;kills almost 3 out of every 1,000 people&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Many medical experts have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-texas-rfk-jr-response-vaccines-doctors-wary-rcna194510" target="_blank"&gt;taken issue with his approach&lt;/a&gt; to the current measles outbreak, which has included &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085" target="_blank"&gt;emphasizing unproven treatments&lt;/a&gt; and framing vaccination as a personal choice (which some doctors view as a nod to his anti-vaccine supporters). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy also suggested that measles cases are inevitable in the United States because of ebbing immunity from vaccines — a notion doctors say is false. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the vaccine wanes very quickly,” Kennedy said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine offer lifelong protection. That’s because the vaccine stimulates the production of memory cells, he said, which can recognize the virus over a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We eliminated measles from this country. That could never happen if immunity waned,” said Offit, who serves on an independent vaccine advisory committee for the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Aside from occasional outbreaks, measles hasn’t been constantly present in the United States since before 2000. It is introduced locally by international travelers, and from there it can spread among undervaccinated communities.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The federal government’s position is, my position is, people should get the measles vaccine. But the government should not be mandating those,” Kennedy told CBS News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The federal government doesn’t mandate childhood vaccines; rather, all 50 states require them for children attending public school. The FDA approves vaccines based on safety and efficacy, and the CDC makes recommendations about who should get them, which states often choose to follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/health/state-non-medical-exemptions-from-school-immunization-requirements" target="_blank"&gt;all 50 states have exemptions to vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt; for medical reasons, and all but five have additional exemptions for other reasons, such as religious or personal objections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The current outbreak was fueled by transmission in a primarily Mennonite community in Gaines County, Texas, where vaccine hesitancy is prevalent. There have been 668 total cases since January, according to NBC News’ tally, including two pediatric deaths and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-new-mexico-resident-tests-positive-death-rcna195231" target="_blank"&gt;one suspected death in an unvaccinated adult&lt;/a&gt;. Before those deaths, the United States hadn’t had a measles death in a decade, and a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5331a3.htm#" target="_blank"&gt;child hadn’t died of measles&lt;/a&gt; since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/rfk-jr-pushes-fluoride-policy-review-cites-autism-concerns-237047877801" target="_blank"&gt;pointed to higher case numbers in Europe&lt;/a&gt; as evidence that the United States is responding appropriately to the outbreak. But the figure he has cited recently — roughly 127,000 measles cases in Europe — is &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/13-03-2025-european-region-reports-highest-number-of-measles-cases-in-more-than-25-years---unicef--who-europe" target="_blank"&gt;the total for last year across 53 countries&lt;/a&gt;. Low vaccination rates in southeastern Europe were a major contributor, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He has this way of kind of twisting things,” said Dr. William Moss, director of the Johns Hopkins International Vaccine Access Center. “We should be comparing measles in the United States this year to measles in the United States and prior years. To say Europe has more cases over one year than we’ve had in three months this year, it’s just a false comparison.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;This year’s count in the United States is the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/us-measles-cases-2024-so-far-rcna145013" target="_blank"&gt;highest since 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when there was a major outbreak in Orthodox Jewish communities in New York. Doctors fear the United States could be &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ousted-fda-vaccine-chief-us-measles-elimination-status-threat-rcna199966" target="_blank"&gt;on the verge of losing its measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt; as Kennedy continues to sow doubt about vaccine safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Right now we don’t know the risks of many of these products because they’re not safety tested,” Kennedy told CBS News. “Many of the vaccines are only tested for three or four days with no placebo group.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children’s Hospital, said vaccine development usually takes 10 to 20 years, with the notable exception of Covid shots, which were brought to market in less than a year thanks to mRNA technology and a coordinated, worldwide effort. (Even then, the &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/publications-and-special-projects/penn-medicine-magazine/winter-2022/from-foundational-discoveries-to-pandemic-proliferation-of-impact" target="_blank"&gt;foundational research behind mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; dates to 1997.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When it comes to childhood immunizations, many of which were approved decades ago, there may not have been placebo controls or long-term safety follow-ups for each one, Levy said. However, he noted that even after vaccines are approved, various government-led surveillance systems monitor for adverse reactions. And in the &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2726" target="_blank"&gt;rare case they find anything&lt;/a&gt;, that vaccine is pulled from the market, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Moss agreed that the types of clinical trials for vaccines have changed over time. However, “I don’t think there’s any other product we use that’s more rigorously evaluated for both safety and efficacy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Offit said Kennedy “just keeps picking and picking” at vaccine safety with statements that aren’t scientifically valid — for instance, by suggesting that &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1819855873801392393" target="_blank"&gt;all childhood vaccines weren’t tested against placebos&lt;/a&gt;, when, in fact, many were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The problem with RFK Jr. is his definition of ‘placebo,’” Offit said. “His definition of placebo is either water or saline, meaning just normal sodium chloride, but that’s not the FDA’s definition. The FDA’s definition is something that’s inert.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said Kennedy “raised valid concerns about vaccine trial practices, including the use of active comparators instead of inert placebos and short observation windows — issues backed by public data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But doctors said there’s a legitimate reason to use active comparators — vaccines that have already been approved for given infections — instead of placebos: It would be unethical to withhold the benefit of a vaccine from study participants, so trials often test new vaccines against older versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Levy said there’s always room for more safety studies or longer-term follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I think the secretary is right that we could do more to study vaccine safety,” he said. “By all means, let’s dig in. Let’s see, did we miss anything? Should we learn more? But let’s not forget that these vaccines in childhood have averted severe disease in children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxNQThWSTlaNDlHMUJrU0pVR0FaaDU4RndEVnBzWkFvbEluQm1DbUFlWWw0NzlheU13ZlJRQzFfMUZvdmpMd29KMlVKNGsxdjZJb1lPV3dpX1gtc09Zd2ZISV95allnT29RUk4tTzJGQ2ZUU2Z1UEo2Y08wcjVLYmxieDVqV1pHNld5MVlTaWpVQVUwd3c2NnhxZWY4OWRuSE9hWF8tMDZrRXVmalBjUXcxUjRwVETSAVZBVV95cUxOSVlFRTdRWE1TYXRsMndFV3F2S2hLSXRqVldTOFNZZXFXM1h0dHBJMlhzNlY0bl9NamJ1UmdzZXZKRkl6YWZ1SFZCaGJfaEx6bGVJQ0V1Zw</guid></item><item><title>Popular Diabetes Drug Linked to 45% Lower Dementia Risk - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQanh5YURBSExvVDlmQVZ3WUFvMEJOS09GVUVqbGdvRS1NbGs2R3ljQk1ZeGhNdXZxaTAwYzl2dllzZ0FSUERFWVlLRm1INjY2RFl0V0ZTY3VCUi10U3h5SkFfcERtb3NkTlBNbk9EWDV6RUNaWVUtUlhaY2lIVU9laDB4MllTMDA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 08:26:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQanh5YURBSExvVDlmQVZ3WUFvMEJOS09GVUVqbGdvRS1NbGs2R3ljQk1ZeGhNdXZxaTAwYzl2dllzZ0FSUERFWVlLRm1INjY2RFl0V0ZTY3VCUi10U3h5SkFfcERtb3NkTlBNbk9EWDV6RUNaWVUtUlhaY2lIVU9laDB4MllTMDA</guid></item><item><title>Professor explains who suffers side effects of cholesterol drug statins - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQcTBMZzVmeWVuM09zRUZGOTEyeEVXbWw1RHBwV1dGTGxNWVNKejVOZ2ZxR0RLaTg4aUxTVXI2cDRvdnlHYV9QZXpQLUpKTDh5ZUl3dTVLUzF6ZW8zUnhNTEZ1ME9sbHh0Y3dFMTRlSHMxeTBVUFR5bXJxMldfdEphZENGQWZ4VnNwQ18tWg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fewer than one-in-10 people suffer side effects from statins, according to recent research. &lt;span&gt;Intolerance to the cholesterol-busting drugs is "over-estimated and over-diagnosed", say scientists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;True prevalence is between six and 10 per cent. Up to half of patients stop taking them or reduce the dose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It increases the risk of heart and circulation problems caused by harmful fats, or lipids. They can lead to potentially fatal blood clots. &lt;span&gt;The pills have been linked to muscle pain, headaches, dizziness, nausea, tiredness and digestive problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lead author Professor Maciej Banach, of the Medical University of Lodz in Poland, said: "These results were not a surprise to me but they were for many other experts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "They show in most cases statin intolerance is over-estimated and over-diagnosed. &lt;span&gt;They mean around 93% of patients on statin therapy can be treated effectively - with very good tolerability and without any safety issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The largest study of its kind to date was based on more than 4 million individuals across the world. &lt;span&gt;Statins are prescribed to up to 8 million Britons - protecting against heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prof Banach said: "Our findings mean we should evaluate patients' symptoms very carefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "Firstly to see whether symptoms are indeed caused by statins, and secondly, to evaluate whether it might be patients' perceptions that statins are harmful. &lt;span&gt;The so called 'nocebo' or 'drucebo' effect could be responsible for more than 50% of all symptoms - rather than the drug itself."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Statins are among the most commonly prescribed drugs. There is "strong and unambiguous" evidence that they combat cardiovascular disease. &lt;span&gt;It was not been clear what proportion of the population are actually allergic to them - until now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Inconsistent reports from studies, randomised controlled trials and databases suggested numbers ranging from five to 50 per cent. &lt;span&gt;The study, published in the European Heart Journal, found the real figure is at the lower end of the scale. It pooled data from 176 studies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Overall prevalence was nine per cent - falling to seven, 6.7 and six per cent when using diagnostic criteria from the National Lipid Association, the International Lipid Expert Panel and the European Atherosclerosis Society, respectively. &lt;span&gt;Those who were older, female, of Black or Asian race, obese, or suffering from diabetes, under-active thyroid glands, or chronic liver or kidney failure were more likely to be statin intolerant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In addition, drugs to control irregular heartbeat, calcium channel blockers for chest pain and high blood pressure, heavy drinking and higher statin doses were other aggravating factors. &lt;span&gt;Prof Banach said: "It's critically important to know about these risk factors so we can predict effectively that a particular patient is at higher risk of statin intolerance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "Then we can consider upfront other ways to treat them in order to reduce the risk and improve adherence to treatment. &lt;span&gt;This could include lower statin doses, combination therapy and use of innovative new drugs."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Prevalence in these groups ranged from 22 percent for high alcohol consumption to 48 per cent for women. &lt;span&gt;Prof Banach said: "I believe the size of our study, which is the largest in the world to investigate this question, means we are able to finally and effectively answer the question about the true prevalence of statin intolerance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"These results clearly show patients needn’t be afraid of statin therapy as it is very well tolerated in as much as 93 per cent, which is similar or even better than other cardiology drugs, including ones for reducing blood pressure and clotting or blocking of blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "What is more, patients need to know that statins may prolong their life, and in cases where side effects appear, we have enough knowledge to manage these effectively. &lt;span&gt;The most important message to patients as a result of this study is that they should keep on taking statins according to the prescribed dose, and discuss any side effects with their doctor, rather than discontinuing the medication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "The same clear message can be addressed to physicians treating patients with high cholesterol levels. &lt;span&gt;Most cases of statin intolerance observed in clinical practice are associated with effects caused by patients' misconceptions about the side effects of statins or may be due to other reasons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "Therefore, we should carefully evaluate symptoms, assessing in detail patients' medical histories, when the symptoms appeared, specific details of pain, other medications the patients are taking, and other conditions and risk factors. &lt;span&gt;Then we will see that statins can be used safely in most patients, which is critically important for reducing their cholesterol levels and preventing heart and blood vessel diseases and death."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 07:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxQcTBMZzVmeWVuM09zRUZGOTEyeEVXbWw1RHBwV1dGTGxNWVNKejVOZ2ZxR0RLaTg4aUxTVXI2cDRvdnlHYV9QZXpQLUpKTDh5ZUl3dTVLUzF6ZW8zUnhNTEZ1ME9sbHh0Y3dFMTRlSHMxeTBVUFR5bXJxMldfdEphZENGQWZ4VnNwQ18tWg</guid></item><item><title>New study shows 'surprisingly common' symptom can lead to heart failure - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxObDhFSFdzSUkzSVlXRnVlcnAySmRRcjJpRTBXek1oOEZHNXEtM24td0YwTE1tQ0NyNkx4X2g4b3dDQVlHNXpubjVhbmxQblI3MDNaNFFNbDdKelVQVHVlT2NzVThFSGRoMHdtLUx0SjZjTW1RTHJUR1ZXbEhmcjFkb2YtclF0QkhFTWktaNIBkgFBVV95cUxPd05pOXdDLXJIaTYzcGtnaHQ2VEdBcWltM0h5RWhBR2h0R2ZEQVktRHdtR09TVnRPQWFrbFVGS1dMbEhIR1NFeDMyYVRWQjhzLVc0TkVFX3BrTjU5UTdaTXBaQzlSQTJzNjg3MmFVd3B1TmRKeDIyZEFUb0VaY3pfUGtrck1UM2xMSUNzZUpjNEVlUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study has revealed that hearing impairment can increase an individual's risk of heart failure. The research highlighted the significant role psychological distress, caused by hearing loss, plays in developing heart-related issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chinese experts analysed UK Biobank data from 164,431 individuals who had undergone tests to determine their hearing ability. Out of these, approximately 160,062 did not use hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Participants were divided into three groups based on their performance in a digit triplet test (DTT), a screening tool for hearing problems that uses random combinations of digits against background noise. None of the participants initially included in the analysis had heart failure. However, over a follow-up period exceeding 11 years, around 4,449 developed the condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling in the legs and ankles. It is estimated that over one million people in the UK live with this long-term condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that those with a higher speech reception threshold (SRT) – meaning they required louder speech to comprehend words – had an increased risk of heart failure. They stated: "Compared with those with normal hearing, participants with insufficient hearing, poor hearing, or hearing aid use had higher heart failure risks."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Main symptoms heart failure&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms of heart failure are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/shortness-of-breath/" rel="nofollow"&gt;breathlessness&lt;/a&gt; – this may occur after activity or at rest; it may be worse when you're lying down, and you may wake up at night needing to catch your breath&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fatigue – you may feel tired most of the time and find exercise exhausting&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;swollen ankles and legs – this is caused by a build-up of fluid (&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/oedema/" rel="nofollow"&gt;oedema&lt;/a&gt;); it may be better in the morning and get worse later in the day&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;feeling lightheaded and fainting&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;High SRT levels were also linked with psychological distress, social isolation, and neuroticism among those who did not use hearing aids. Researchers stated: "We have been the first to demonstrate that poor hearing ability is significantly associated with a higher risk of incident heart failure in the general population."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Psychological factors, especially psychological distress, play a significant mediating role in this association. "If further confirmed, hearing impairment may be a potential risk factor or marker for incident heart failure in the general population, highlighting the importance of integrating hearing health assessments into broader cardiovascular risk evaluation frameworks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strengthening psychological intervention in people with hearing impairment may be an important path and strategy to reduce the risk of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 07:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxObDhFSFdzSUkzSVlXRnVlcnAySmRRcjJpRTBXek1oOEZHNXEtM24td0YwTE1tQ0NyNkx4X2g4b3dDQVlHNXpubjVhbmxQblI3MDNaNFFNbDdKelVQVHVlT2NzVThFSGRoMHdtLUx0SjZjTW1RTHJUR1ZXbEhmcjFkb2YtclF0QkhFTWktaNIBkgFBVV95cUxPd05pOXdDLXJIaTYzcGtnaHQ2VEdBcWltM0h5RWhBR2h0R2ZEQVktRHdtR09TVnRPQWFrbFVGS1dMbEhIR1NFeDMyYVRWQjhzLVc0TkVFX3BrTjU5UTdaTXBaQzlSQTJzNjg3MmFVd3B1TmRKeDIyZEFUb0VaY3pfUGtrck1UM2xMSUNzZUpjNEVlUQ</guid></item><item><title>How US funding cuts are threatening South African families living with HIV - Al Jazeera</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Johannesburg, South Africa –&lt;/strong&gt; Last year, Mary* finally had the conversation she had been dreading for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary has lived with HIV since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the 36-year-old has also carried the burden of another secret: Lita*, her daughter, was born with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking from her four-room home in the bustling township of Soweto, just south of Johannesburg, where she lives with Lita and her parents, Mary recalls the fear she felt as she prepared to tell her child about her condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had to tell her last year that she has HIV eventually, and I was very worried,” she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lita has been receiving treatment since birth – a daily antiretroviral (ARV) tablet that is a combination of different drugs. The pill stops the HIV virus from reproducing in her body and keeps her immune system healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My child is very healthy and happy,” Mary beams, her eyes lighting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But until recently, Lita, who is thriving at 12 years old, didn’t understand what the medication was for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lita now participates in a local after-school programme that not only provides assistance with homework but also incorporates sports and psychosocial support for children living with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary, who is currently unemployed and a single mother, relies on a government grant as well as support from her family to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The struggle for mother and daughter begins with the challenge of securing medication to treat HIV, but it also extends to managing the daily reality of living with the virus, which includes social stigma, and accessing healthy food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the months when she can’t go to the local government clinic to collect her and her daughter’s ARV treatment because of persisting health issues partly related to her HIV status, Mary finds solace in the support of the community organisation Crystal Fountain, which delivers medication to her doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organisation also has a disclosure programme through which social workers helped Mary speak to Lita about her condition and how, although she will have to be on treatment for the rest of her life, she could still be healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They helped me in telling my child that she has HIV and made us feel very supported,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary and Lita also benefit from the organisation’s food vouchers, allowing them to obtain groceries like maize meal and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But critical support provided by Crystal Fountain and other community initiatives addressing HIV/AIDS now hangs in the balance. The administration of United States President Donald Trump, which was responsible for funding nearly a fourth of what South Africa spends to combat HIV, has threatened these programmes with sweeping cuts to US foreign aid budgets. Some organisations have been forced to shut down certain programmes while others have stopped operating entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_3628132" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3628132" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3628132" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25047660562477-1744028712.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C513" alt="South Africa HIV Aid Freeze"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-3628132" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In the town of Umzimkhulu in eastern South Africa, Nozuko Majola, 19, pictured with her children, is one of the millions of patients in South Africa affected by Trump’s global foreign aid freeze, raising concerns about HIV patients not receiving treatment [Jerome Delay/AP Photo]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="we-have-to-help-these-parents"&gt;‘We have to help these parents’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magnitude of the HIV epidemic in South Africa, a country of 63 million people, is staggering. About 7.8 million currently live with HIV, including an estimated 270,000 children under 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, 10,000 children are estimated to be infected with HIV while 2,100 die from HIV-related causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="/news/2025/3/24/hiv-and-aids-deaths-could-increase-globally-amid-us-aid-freeze-un-says"&gt;UNAIDS&lt;/a&gt;, the United Nations agency that coordinates global action for preventing and treating HIV/AIDS, the majority of these cases stem from transmission occurring before or during birth with a smaller number contracting the virus later through breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Trump, the US government halted funding for the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a global health investment introduced in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, South Africa received about $440m in PEPFAR funding, accounting for 22 percent of the country’s $2.56bn HIV budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This budget goes towards treatment for millions of people, testing programmes, HIV research, education drives and other community support initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PEPFAR is the source of most of the funding for South Africa’s HIV programmes supported by USAID, the US Agency for International Development. Under Trump, the agency has in effect been dismantled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the halt in funding, counselling initiatives and programmes including testing, education and community support have shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is at risk is the support we were giving to the households of kids infected with HIV,” Rebecca Chakane, a social worker with Crystal Fountain in Soweto, explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The [food] vouchers and the support groups – those are very important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the sprawling township of Soweto, countless families among the 1.8 million people who live there struggle with HIV. The hardship faced by mothers of HIV-positive children echoes in the words of Soweto resident Tshepiso*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She describes her emotional turmoil following the diagnosis at birth of her nine-month-old son, Thulani*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has been very, very hard,” she confides, adding that she blamed herself for her son’s condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tshepiso, like Mary, relies on free medication from state-run clinics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa’s health minister, Aaron Motsoaledi, says the funding cuts for HIV programmes will not affect access to free ARV treatment that millions of people receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no chance of medication being interrupted. [The] government buys 90 percent of medication and the other 10 percent comes from the Global Fund [NGO],” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, beyond medication, Tshepiso has needed emotional support, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her search for solidarity, Tshepiso discovered a monthly support group run by Crystal Fountain for parents raising HIV-positive children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the shared stories and collective struggles, she found a community. The organisation also provided monthly food packages, a source of immense help and relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Crystal Fountain has now ended some programmes, including its food aid, and Tshepiso worries about how she will feed herself and her baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what we are going to do,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to nutritious food, especially in impoverished areas like Soweto, is a vital component of children’s overall treatment, according to Chakane, who says research over the years has illuminated how HIV management must go beyond just the provision of ARV drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support programmes are also crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some children become resentful of their parents upon learning they have HIV, which may lead them to abandon their medication. Community workers help families navigate this scenario – and it is one they often encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most kids blame their parents for the infection, creating a complicated situation that sometimes leads them to stop taking treatment. Therefore, we have to help these parents,” Chakane says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the USAID cuts, we can’t do these [support] programmes any more,” she laments, pointing to the ripple effect of funding losses on essential services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nowhere-to-turn"&gt;‘Nowhere to turn’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mpumalanga province, about 300km east of Soweto, 31-year-old community worker Thulisile Mahole voices her anguish over the abrupt closure of the Greater Rape Intervention Programme (GRIP), a USAID-supported nonprofit where she worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/economy/2025/2/27/us-cutting-foreign-aid-budgets-by-more-than-90-trump-administration-says"&gt;US government&lt;/a&gt; dramatically slashed its foreign aid budgets soon after Trump took office on January 20. On the morning of January 28, Mahole, who captures data for community programmes aimed at addressing HIV/AIDS and combating gender-based violence, left home for her office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I went to work expecting just another regular day, but then they called a staff meeting and told us that the USAID cut had happened and we had to stop everything right away. It was so chaotic,” she recalls. “I was devastated. I was in complete shock. As a parent with bills to pay, you are never prepared for a situation like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahole’s journey at GRIP began as a first responder in a care room – private rooms in police stations run by NGOs aimed at assisting and protecting victims of sexual violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We provided a safe space for women. When someone reports a rape case, they often have to return to the home of the person who harmed them,” Mahole explains, referring to how family members or intimate partners are often perpetrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our role was to make survivors feel seen and supported, to show them there was a place for them to go if they felt unsafe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survivors would go to them before they had even spoken to police officers, she says. “I would provide them with basic counselling. … We assisted them in opening police cases and obtaining medical help,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a country with high rates of rape with more than 40,000 rapes recorded annually, according to police statistics, and the&lt;a href="/news/2025/2/28/africa-hiv-deaths-to-mount-as-trump-stops-funding-heres-why"&gt; highest number of people living with HIV in the world&lt;/a&gt;, programmes like GRIP were essential in providing support to survivors and helping curb the spread of HIV. It provided rape victims, who are at risk of contracting the virus, with preventive medication and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GRIP’s care rooms now stand empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it closed, rape survivors have approached Mahole on the street in her township of Dantjie on the outskirts of the eastern city of Mbombela, seeking help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are people who are being raped or harassed, and they want help. They know I worked in a care room that used to aid survivors, and I have to tell them there’s no care rooms any more,” Mahole says, her voice heavy. “It is heartbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Mahole, the thought of these services being discontinued has been nearly impossible to accept. “I couldn’t believe that women who are already so vulnerable would have nowhere to turn,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After losing her job, Mahole hoped that what she calls a “dangerous decision” would be reversed. However, as funding cuts became widespread, her hopes began to fade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_3628102" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3628102" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3628102" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2024-11-03T141135Z_1024407143_RC23BAAZQL20_RTRMADP_3_TRAVEL-CM-JOHANNESBURG-1744028329.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C524" alt="South Africa HIV Aid Freeze"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-3628102" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A woman walks past the decommissioned Orlando Power Station in Soweto [Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sole-breadwinners-affected"&gt;Sole breadwinners affected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Networking HIV and AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA), which commissioned GRIP to deliver its support programmes, says the consequences of terminating these programmes are too enormous to quantify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesperson Sophie Knobbs notes that GRIP had been active since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Before the cuts, we were reaching 32,000 survivors a year. Now, those survivors could be left without any support,” Knobbs says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NACOSA has been forced to shut down all its USAID-supported programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“More than 160 of our 470 staff members were immediately let go of, and a radical restructure is under way,” Knobbs adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She emphasises that community workers – many of whom were survivors of gender-based violence themselves – were among the hardest hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many of them are the sole breadwinners for their families,” she says. “It has been devastating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_3628106" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3628106" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3628106" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-03-13T174917Z_995199452_RC2HCDAUCIJ6_RTRMADP_3_SAFRICA-TRANSPORT-1744028365.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C515" alt="South Africa HIV Aid Freeze"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-3628106" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Minibus taxis are seen at Bara Taxi Rank, one of the busiest transport hubs in Soweto.

&lt;h2 id="risk-a-rebound"&gt;‘Risk a rebound’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s cuts to USAID which distributes PEPFAR funding, not only halted HIV support programmes but also stalled HIV research and clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a crisis,” says Glenda Gray, a leading HIV researcher in South Africa at the University of the Witwatersrand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you take your foot off the accelerator, you risk a rebound in HIV transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, about 50,000 people died of HIV-related causes, according to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Desmond Tutu HIV Centre, a research facility at the University of Cape Town, says the suspension of US funding could lead to an additional 500,000 HIV-linked deaths in South Africa over the next decade. This is due to a halt in testing, awareness and support programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gray says the medical community, NGOs and the government are scrambling to find interim solutions for funding critical HIV research programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, she is sceptical that these efforts could salvage essential research programmes that had relied on US National Institutes of Health grants, now halted by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The situation has threatened basic science,” Gray tells Al Jazeera. “Many researchers working on critical HIV projects have had to be laid off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the projects that has come to a halt was work on a promising vaccine to prevent HIV. The BRILLIANT Consortium, led by three scientists in South Africa, relied completely on a $45m USAID grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the grant stopping, our progress has been delayed, and it’s a huge challenge,” explains Neetha Shagan Morar, a research manager with the project. “We can’t treat our way out of the HIV epidemic. We need a preventative vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, researchers, NGO staff and parents are concerned about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite government assurances that AVR medication will remain accessible, Mary and others worry about whether the loss of HIV programmes could ultimately cost children like Lita the medication they need to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For now, we don’t know if we will be affected,” Mary says.&lt;/p&gt;

Presently incurable, early detection allows the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; to decelerate the progression and soften the effects of the condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Commonly, memory loss is linked with dementia; however, a University of Chicago study points to a considerable decrease in the sense of smell as a potential early indicator. This could mean people might recognise Alzheimer's in its initial stages during routine activities like showering or bathing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, it comes down to the capacity to identify odours, which hinges on memory. In pursuit of a smell-test screening comparable to checks for vision and hearing, researchers examined the olfactory function of 515 older individuals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tests could prompt individuals to watch for possible signs, such as a diminished ability to detect the scent of personal care products while bathing, according to a report by The Express.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Professor Jayant M Pinto from the University of Chicago—known for his work on olfaction and sinus disease—remarked as the senior author: "This study provides another clue to how a rapid decline in the sense of smell is a really good indicator of what's going to end up structurally occurring in specific regions of the brain."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Common early symptoms of dementia&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Different types of dementia can affect people differently, and everyone will experience symptoms in their own way. However, there are some common early symptoms that may appear some time before a diagnosis of dementia. These include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/memory-loss-amnesia/" rel="nofollow"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;difficulty concentrating&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;finding it hard to carry out familiar daily tasks, such as getting confused over the correct change when shopping&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;struggling to follow a conversation or find the right word&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;being confused about time and place&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;mood changes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers found a link between the decline in sense of smell and the volume and shape of grey matter in brain areas responsible for smell and memory, stating: "We were able to show that the volume and shape of grey matter in olfactory and memory-associated areas of the brains of people with rapid decline in their sense of smell were smaller compared to people who had less severe olfactory decline."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If concerns about memory or potential dementia arise, consulting a GP is recommended. Similarly, encouraging someone to see a GP if symptoms are suspected, and possibly accompanying them, can be supportive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early diagnosis of dementia can facilitate access to future care and treatment. Although there is currently no cure, timely medical intervention can help manage the condition more effectively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to research, over 944,000 people in the UK have dementia, a number expected to increase in the coming years. Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia, followed by vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The NHS highlights common dementia symptoms, including issues with memory loss, cognitive speed, mental acuity, mood, and challenges with daily tasks. However, a lesser-known sign to look out for is the loss of smell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To learn more about Alzheimer's disease, visit &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;The Alzheimer's Society website &lt;/a&gt;or the &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dementia/symptoms-and-diagnosis/symptoms/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;NHS website's section on symptom&lt;/a&gt;s, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 06:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNVlgzMEw2VktBRnVkZl9JbTRsMThMaTBRMlNLQXNYMDdXQXNIcE9XTUhmQVlKVGhfMUZGRGdSMHdjaXJYb3VhYkRWRFozRVJEMzRsTm5pWXJHTGVIY3VmOTJOM3NUTjEwZzZPOGJVUnJkYUxvYjlQM0dScjBGX21YU3RUQUxJWE1ta2fSAY8BQVVfeXFMTlQ0bTB6Zk94djJRRGJmVDJLNzJGWHVGY3QzcW9HRHlQWGh5UDZDRjd0UGZXQTQ4eHdIbUZlT0p3Rlg5NjZ2VHJabUFDeEk0RG5ISmJzTHJERDBBeE5yOGtld0JjWm1oR2FuRnpMUUZXN19UblpNTjhiVW1xRnZXQ2VCX2Zjd1VTeGFWMVJrVzg</guid></item><item><title>Health expert says start doing these 5 things today to protect yourself from colon cancer - Hindustan Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7wFBVV95cUxNWDF6Q1BuOHBSX3l2LTUwa3RUcnlISXZpcjlrVGtaT2NGZWgzbXhsVF9HMnpJZnBHaDh5YVpHMW5fRjFiNzVRY2I3a3NaNWxHRWI2UUVSdGo4X1B2SHhpNE0zRnR4RVRWZnF1bGtCbzBkN0ZrbV9JX2xoaFlucnI3eG91ckpUUTgtdGVzTDNBZXZrVXJ6MXotQVMwQ1UyczFnTS1kWXBTOExNcjc3Rm5xWlNRT1ltcmVmM1VNN0tROUFQTWZ4OC11d0dCbGNaV0RESFVyeDZIMHpwVGMyZFhHTF9IQTAyNjJJRWk1Y1JXZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/health-expert-says-start-doing-these-5-things-today-to-protect-yourself-from-colon-cancer-101744211820618.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colon cancer is one of the most common &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/cancer" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cancers"&gt;cancers &lt;/a&gt;across the country, but did you know it is highly preventable and treatable when detected early?

Regular screening saves lives:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer tends to develop silently, without any prominent symptoms in its early stages. Hence, regular screening is important for everyone. Everyone should start screening at the age of 45 or even earlier if there is a family history of the disease. Go for tests such as colonoscopy, stool-based tests and CT colonography to help detect polyps or cancer at an early stage and improve one’s quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/12/02/550x309/According-to-WHO--colon-cancer-is-the-third-most-c_1701539729258.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="According to WHO, colon cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide, accounting for approximately 10% of all cases and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. (REPRESENTATIVE PIC)" title="According to WHO, colon cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide, accounting for approximately 10% of all cases and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. (REPRESENTATIVE PIC)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;According to WHO, colon cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide, accounting for approximately 10% of all cases and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. (REPRESENTATIVE PIC)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Adhere to a healthy diet:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fibre-rich diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes helps to cut down the risk of cancer. Reducing processed foods and high-fat foods can also help. Even drinking plenty of water and limiting alcohol intake contribute to better colon health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Exercise every day:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a known fact that a sedentary lifestyle can expose you to the risk of a plethora of diseases and conditions. Regular exercise, such as walking, jogging, yoga, or strength training, helps improve digestion and lower inflammation in the body. One must get at least 30 minutes of exercise for 5 days a week to maintain a healthy colon.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_630x354/HT/p2/2019/10/17/Pictures/_d6bee990-f0d2-11e9-8e48-0fd2949bd28d.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="According to the researchers, exercise is important for cancer prevention and can lower the risk of developing colon, breast, endometrial, kidney, bladder, esophagus and stomach cancers.(Unsplash)" title="According to the researchers, exercise is important for cancer prevention and can lower the risk of developing colon, breast, endometrial, kidney, bladder, esophagus and stomach cancers.(Unsplash)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;According to the researchers, exercise is important for cancer prevention and can lower the risk of developing colon, breast, endometrial, kidney, bladder, esophagus and stomach cancers.(Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Family history and genetics:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with a family history of colon cancer are at a higher risk. So, screening should begin earlier, right from the age of 25. Genetic counselling may also help assess personal risk. Do it as suggested by the doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Early symptoms should not be ignored:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you aware? Colon cancer may not show symptoms early on. Constant changes in bowel habits, blood in the stool, sudden weight loss, abdominal pain, or fatigue should be reported to the doctor for further evaluation. The doctor will initiate treatment after the diagnosis of cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colon cancer prevention begins with early detection, healthy habits and awareness. By following a balanced diet, staying active, undergoing regular screenings and paying attention to symptoms. Taking important steps today can make a life-saving difference in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;A cruel consequence of advanced  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="157958" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; is the profound apathy many patients experience as they lose interest in once-cherished activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This symptom is part of a syndrome called cachexia, which affects about &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/research/cachexia"&gt;80% of late-stage cancer patients&lt;/a&gt;, leading to severe muscle wasting and weight loss that leave patients bone thin despite adequate nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This loss of motivation doesn't just deepen patients' suffering, it isolates them from family and friends. Because patients &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5476"&gt;struggle to engage with demanding therapies&lt;/a&gt; that require effort and persistence, it also strains families and complicates treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors typically assume that when late-stage cancer patients withdraw from life, it is an inevitable &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2354.2002.00283.x"&gt;psychological response to physical deterioration&lt;/a&gt;. But what if apathy isn't just a byproduct of physical decline but an integral part of the disease itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our newly published research, my colleagues &lt;a href="https://kepecslab.org/"&gt;and I&lt;/a&gt; have discovered something remarkable: Cancer doesn't simply waste the body – it &lt;a href="https://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm8857"&gt;hijacks a specific brain circuit that controls motivation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, challenge decades of assumptions and suggest it might be possible to restore what many cancer patients describe as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/ppo.0b013e3181f45b90"&gt;most devastating to lose&lt;/a&gt; – their will to engage with life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Untangling fatigue from physical decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To unravel the puzzle of apathy in cancer cachexia, we needed to trace the exact path inflammation takes in the body and peer inside a living brain while the disease is progressing – something impossible in people. However, neuroscientists have advanced technologies that make this possible in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern neuroscience equips us with a powerful &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/illuminating-the-brain-one-neuron-and-synapse-at-a-time-5-essential-reads-about-how-researchers-are-using-new-tools-to-map-its-structure-and-function-187607"&gt;arsenal of tools&lt;/a&gt; to probe how disease changes brain activity in mice. Scientists can &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/mapping-how-the-100-billion-cells-in-the-brain-all-fit-together-is-the-brave-new-world-of-neuroscience-170182"&gt;map entire brains&lt;/a&gt; at the cellular level, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/illuminating-the-brain-one-neuron-and-synapse-at-a-time-5-essential-reads-about-how-researchers-are-using-new-tools-to-map-its-structure-and-function-187607"&gt;track neural activity&lt;/a&gt; during behavior, and precisely &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/brain-stimulation-can-rewire-and-heal-damaged-neural-connections-but-it-isnt-clear-how-research-suggests-personalization-may-be-key-to-more-effective-therapies-182491"&gt;switch neurons on or off&lt;/a&gt;. We used these neuroscience tools in a mouse model of cancer cachexia to study the effects of the disease on the brain and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a small brain region called the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1073858407311100"&gt;area postrema&lt;/a&gt; that acts as the brain's inflammation detector. As a tumor grows, it releases cytokines − molecules that trigger inflammation − into the bloodstream. The area postrema lacks the typical blood-brain barrier that keeps out toxins, pathogens and other molecules from the body, allowing it to directly sample circulating inflammatory signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the area postrema detects a rise in inflammatory molecules, it triggers a neural cascade across multiple brain regions, ultimately suppressing dopamine release in the brain's motivation center − the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.03.003"&gt;nucleus accumbens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While commonly misconstrued as a "pleasure chemical," dopamine is actually associated with drive, or the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/422573a"&gt;willingness to put in effort to gain rewards&lt;/a&gt;: It tips the internal cost-benefit scale toward action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/660902/original/file-20250409-56-7jk4kj.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We &lt;a href="https://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm8857"&gt;directly observed this shift&lt;/a&gt; using two quantitative tests designed with behavioral economics principles to measure effort. In the first, mice repeatedly poked their noses into a food port, with progressively more pokes required to earn each food pellet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second task, mice repeatedly crossed a bridge between two water ports, each gradually depleting with use and forcing the mice to switch sides to replenish the supply, similar to picking berries until a bush is empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cancer progressed, mice still pursued easy rewards but quickly abandoned tasks requiring greater effort. Meanwhile, we watched dopamine levels fall in real time, precisely mirroring the mice's decreasing willingness to work for rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that cancer isn't just generally "wearing out" the brain − it sends targeted inflammatory signals that the brain detects. The brain then responds by rapidly reducing dopamine levels to &lt;a href="https://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm8857"&gt;dial down motivation&lt;/a&gt;. This matches what patients describe: "Everything feels too hard."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Restoring motivation in late-stage disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most exciting, we found &lt;a href="https://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm8857"&gt;several ways to restore motivation&lt;/a&gt; in mice suffering from cancer cachexia − even when the cancer itself continued progressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, by genetically switching off the inflammation-sensing neurons in the area postrema, or by directly stimulating neurons to release dopamine, we were able to restore normal motivation in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we found that giving mice a drug that blocks a particular cytokine − working similarly to existing FDA-approved arthritis treatments − also proved effective. While the drug did not reverse physical wasting, it restored the mice's willingness to work for rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these results are based on mouse models, they suggest a treatment possibility for people: Targeting this specific inflammation-dopamine circuit could improve quality of life for cancer patients, even when the disease remains incurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boundary between physical and psychological symptoms is an &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/"&gt;artificially drawn line&lt;/a&gt;. Cancer ignores this division, using inflammation to commandeer the very circuits that drive a patient's will to act. But our findings suggest these messages can be intercepted and the circuits restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rethinking apathy in disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our discovery has implications far beyond cancer. The inflammatory molecule driving loss of motivation in cancer is also &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1155/2011/765624"&gt;involved in numerous other conditions&lt;/a&gt; − from autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis to chronic infections and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="157958" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same brain circuit might explain the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13072058"&gt;debilitating apathy&lt;/a&gt; that millions of people suffering from various chronic diseases experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apathy triggered by inflammation may have originally &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2015.5"&gt;evolved as a protective mechanism&lt;/a&gt;. When early humans faced acute infections, dialing down motivation made sense − it conserved energy and directed resources toward recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what once helped people survive short-term illnesses turns harmful when inflammation persists chronically, as it does in cancer and other diseases. Rather than &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/feeling-sick-is-an-emotion-meant-to-help-you-get-better-faster-126915"&gt;aiding survival&lt;/a&gt;, prolonged apathy deepens suffering, worsening health outcomes and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While translating these findings into therapies for people requires more research, our discovery reveals a promising target for treatment. By intercepting inflammatory signals or modulating brain circuits, researchers may be able to restore a patient's drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients and families watching motivation slip away, that possibility offers something powerful: hope that even as disease progresses, the essence of who we are might be reclaimed.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254043/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

It was just spewing out of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was holding his neck and when I took a look the blood was spitting from his neck. He didn't go completely through the window and his hip to his legs were hanging out so he was able to pull himself back in.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Horrifying images show a gaping &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14333019/Pictured-mother-died-chiropractor-neck-crack-workout.html"&gt;four inch wide, 1.5 inch deep hole&lt;/a&gt; running across his neck, from the mouth to his ear - barely missing his jugular veins that are responsible for bringing blood back from the brain to the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Aceson Dubois, now five, nearly died last year after he went through a window and ended up with a massive wound on his neck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even minor damage to the jugular veins can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage, blood clots in the vein, inflammation of the vein wall and infections - all of which could cause serious brain damage and heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alyssa is now calling on parents to protect their children by installing safety guards all around their homes and learn how to treat wounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Remembering how she attempted first aid to&lt;span&gt; stop the flow of 'spitting' blood and waited for emergency services, the young mother said: 'I was terrified, I thought that was it. I thought he had hit a main artery and was going to die.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I grabbed his neck and pinched everything I could. I used the laundry that we had on the couch and I began to stuff his neck and had [the wound] closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My hands were slipping all over my son because of all the blood all over him. He was just screaming on the porch and kept saying "mommy, please don't let me die."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It [the glass] missed his jugular [veins] by an inch. He ended up slicing his saliva gland in half and the bottom half of his ear off.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The saliva, or salivary, glands are located in the head and neck region and are responsible for lubricating the mouth, swallowing, digestion and protect teeth against harmful bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Aceson reached the McLeod Regional Medical Center in Florence, South Carolina, he immediately underwent a two-hour emergency surgery to have his neck, saliva gland and ear stitched back together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alyssa said: 'The whole time while I was waiting for him to come out of his first surgery, I couldn't stop shaking and I felt sick. After surgery, when I went in to see him, I looked at him asleep and it broke my heart into a million pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was happy because I knew he was going to live but the darker side of me was like this is what I'd be looking at if he didn't make it through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What broke my heart the most was he turned to me and said, "thank you for not letting me die."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aceson had a second surgery to a week later to remove some stitches and was discharged to make a full recovery at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A year later from the accident, Aceson has no permanent nerve damage and is healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Aceson underwent a surgery at the McLeod Regional Medical Center in Florence, South Carolina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, both Aceson, now five, and Alyssa have been diagnosed with PTSD and are receiving counseling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The terrified mother revealed that the kindergartener is fearful of going near windows and every time Alyssa hears a loud noise, she gets anxious her kids could be hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, she has removed the window Aceson fell through from her mobile home and has covered others with furniture to help stop a repeat of the tragic accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now urging parents to childproof their homes and to educate themselves on basic first aid training so they know how to stop bleeding fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts note that common ways to childproof your home include securing heavy furniture, covering outlets, installing safety latches on cabinets and drawers and using baby gates to restrict access to dangerous areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alyssa is also warning other parents to learn how to pack a wound - which involves putting materials such as gauze into the wound to help control bleeding and prevent infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She shared: 'At the time of the accident, I was healthcare trained so I was very knowledgeable and knew what I needed to do to help control the bleeding before we got to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The terrified mother revealed that the toddler is fearful of going near windows and every time she hears a loud noise, she gets anxious her kids could be hurt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A year later from the accident, Aceson has no permanent nerve damage and is healthy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Learning how to properly pack a wound when there is uncontrollable bleeding is something every mom should know. Not even just moms, people in general should know how to do this.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She specifies that parents should ensure their windows are made of shatterproof glass and tape gymnastic mats in corners and on windows to safeguard young children.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each year, about 2,300 children younger than 15 years die from unintentional injuries in their homes and over 3.4 million children experience an unintentional home-related injury in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the World Health Organization estimates that about 270,000 children under the age of five die each year from accidents at home across the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Childproofing could prevent an estimated 55 percent of household injuries in children 10 years old and younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 01:55:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQZVA5X1cyRG82RGFWTGcyVUlTcWNCRjd4NnNoQ0J3ckJnSzRuMHc1NEpVY1p0UXZLWkRhNTJpTThvS0tJekJZNHJOb0JSd0VLd241ekphZDBkRkw1Ym9hRmF5WnhQWlppY3J5V0JRMVlOYXA4Q0VITVN6Tm5IOWUtallZQk0tdG9QaUlJbUZPQ0hjTGs4MlRjS0doajVXOC1JOTgtbFRnc3ctUdIBrwFBVV95cUxPV3pCd2JkUGktcTNZYVRrS1NpMm1fRGlSbWhlSkR1Z2NEcm5MQXJlZlVzYzNzQzhjLWs2cXdRYzhWWEZucHRxcHNyMUFSb1RaYlh2VmVSZkRQeXRYTEMweXhEa2Znc0dTcnJRR005dmVjQmZGZmxYSzg2S19zaXM5SmhwakttSEdSUVAtLW9ILW1FVUFCWG5sUXpfYWtJRjdGaHF1M29jbHZYNmNXRTcw</guid></item><item><title>Plastic surgeon reveals the SAFEST body alteration you could ever make - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plastic surgery is becoming increasingly popular in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And with the rising rates of people going under the knife comes the question of safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You've heard a lot about some of the more dangerous surgical procedures like BBLs, but what about some of the procedures that are the safest? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Arnold S. Breitbart has been a plastic surgeon for more than 30 years and he has now told DailyMail.com that the safest plastic surgical procedures are the minimally invasive ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in his opinion, one of the absolute safest body alterations is &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/liposuction/index.html" id="mol-2d570860-163d-11f0-a7fe-b90172f5b10b"&gt;liposuction&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The incisions are tiny and the procedure is commonly performed in an office operating room, usually under local anesthesia,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Breitbart has been performing liposuction procedures for as long as he's been a plastic surgeon and has done thousands on this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, they're so common that he does several of these surgeries a week in his office operating room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Arnold Breitbart has been a plastic surgeon for more than 30 years and says liposuction is one of the safest procedures possible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Breitbart performs several liposuction surgeries a week (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I operate with advanced liposuction techniques such as SmartLipo, which uses a laser during the liposuction procedure to make the liposuction more effective,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Breitbart explained that these liposuction procedures are likely popular because they're ideal for patients who may be close to their ideal weight, but have areas where they want to get rid of fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said that liposuction is most commonly performed on areas including the abdomen, the flanks (also known as love handles), out and inner thighs, inner knees, the back, arms, and neck.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've performed liposuction on professional models, trainers, and athletes, who despite excellent diet, exercise, and lifestyle, still have these disproportionate areas of increased fatty fullness,' Dr. Breitbart said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Liposuction may be appropriate for somewhat heavier patients, but generally not for obese patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Patients find liposuction to be a very attractive procedure, as the procedure is outpatient and the recovery is quick.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while liposuction is popular, Dr. Breitbart said that he's seen an increase in patients seeking plastic surgery for the removal of lose skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is mostly due to the recent rise in GLP-1 weight loss medications like Ozempic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Liposuction is typically performed on patients who might be close to their ideal weight but have a few 'problem areas' they want to fix (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In these massive weight loss patients, loose skin is a common secondary effect,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It may affect parts of the body including the abdomen, arms, breasts, and face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Procedures such as tummy tuck, arm lift, breast lift, facelift, and necklift may be indicated in these patients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Breitbart agrees that patients should probably steer clear of dangerous procedures like BBLs mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In general, I discourage the use of implants placed in the buttocks, as there are increased complication rates associated with this procedure,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But if you're looking for a procedure that will give you bigger buttocks, he said to at least consider a fat transfer first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — A top Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official told staff this week to start planning for the agency’s splintering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several parts of CDC — mostly those devoted to health threats that aren’t infectious — are being spun off into the soon-to-be-created Administration for a Healthy America, the agency official told senior leaders in calls and meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directive came from Dr. Debra Houry, the agency’s chief medical officer, according to three CDC officials who were in attendance. They declined to be identified because they weren’t authorized to talk about the plans and fear being fired if they were identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/employees-say-a-plan-to-reorganize-hhs-will-have-health-and-safety-consequences"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Employees say a plan to reorganize HHS will have health and safety consequences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked to comment, Houry referred The Associated Press to CDC media relations representatives. CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald acknowledged the agency is planning for possible changes but that “none of the items discussed at the meeting have been finalized, and are subject to change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Scott Harris, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said there are “a lot more questions than there are answers right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those questions include whether the split will interrupt funding and assistance to state health departments that ultimately implement federal health policy, said Harris, who also is Alabama’s state health officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’d love to be able to give input,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Officials deciding what to do with programs that lost many staffers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta-based CDC is charged with protecting Americans from preventable health threats. It had roughly 13,000 employees at the beginning of the year, the bulk of them in Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has embarked on a dramatic downsizing of many federal agencies. The CDC’s headcount was slashed by rounds of early retirements and layoffs that reduced staffing by 3,500 to 4,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layoffs targeted not just job classifications but offices and programs. For example, everyone at the CDC’s division on dental health was axed, as were most workers at an office that investigates occupational diseases and promotes job safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/fda-reverses-course-on-telework-after-staff-reductions-threaten-basic-operations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; FDA reverses course on telework after staff reductions threaten basic operations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, federal health officials are deciding how to reassemble what’s left. They have a Monday deadline to submit a reorganization plan to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has already outlined plans for the new Administration for a Healthy America, which would largely focus on health problems not caused by infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We aren’t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy said in a statement last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experts wonder whether CDC workers would have to move&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has said the AHA will contain — among other things — the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the U.S. Surgeon General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meetings this week, Houry said the new AHA agency also will likely absorb what’s left of the CDC centers devoted to birth defects, chronic conditions, environmental health, injuries, and workplace safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear if those staffers would stay in Atlanta — and that “deeply matters,” said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher who studies government health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/rfk-jr-orders-hhs-to-determine-the-cause-of-autism-by-september"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; RFK Jr. orders HHS to determine the cause of autism by September&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If those jobs are moved to the Washington, D.C., area, “you certainly are going to lose lots of the kinds of experts who have built lives and careers and families in and around Atlanta, many of whom I’m sure would be unable or unwilling to relocate their lives,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would likely mean “you are building something anew, rather than just changing reporting lines,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CDC’s remaining HIV staff would be moved to new agency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parts of CDC not being moved into the AHA would be be mainly focused on infectious diseases, with one notable exception: HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s HIV prevention staff was decimated in the layoffs, with 160 people eliminated. What’s left — the agency’s HIV surveillance and lab operations, for example — would shift to the AHA under the realignment plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/rfk-jr-will-tell-cdc-to-stop-recommending-fluoride-in-drinking-water"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; RFK Jr. will tell CDC to stop recommending fluoride in drinking water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a change would place that CDC work under the same organizational umbrella as HRSA’s Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. That program provides outpatient care, treatment and support services to people with HIV but no health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cleaving of the CDC was proposed in Project 2025, the sweeping Heritage Foundation government-shrinking proposal that surfaced last year. That document called the CDC “the most incompetent and arrogant agency in the federal government” and proposed splitting it into two smaller agencies — one focused on disease data collection and the other more generally on public health.&lt;/p&gt;

(CREDIT: Shutterstock Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the search for better ways to treat diabetes, researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.unige.ch/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of Geneva;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;University of Geneva&lt;/a&gt; have uncovered a promising new approach that could reshape how this disease is managed. At the center of their discovery is a protein called S100A9, which has been shown to reduce dangerous levels of ketones in the blood—without relying on insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people living with type 1 diabetes or those with severe insulin deficiency, life depends on daily injections of insulin. While insulin therapy has saved millions of lives, it’s far from perfect. It’s difficult to dose, can cause serious side effects, and often leads to complications like hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening condition. Researchers at the University of Geneva are now working on a treatment that could support or even replace insulin in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Understanding the Body’s Ketone System&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, your body creates &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/ketones-boost-brain-function-and-guard-against-diabetes-alzheimers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ketones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ketones&lt;/a&gt; as a backup energy source during long periods without food. This process—called ketogenesis—happens in liver cells called hepatocytes. It turns fat into ketone bodies like acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate. These molecules travel through the blood and help fuel other tissues in the body, including the brain and muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Roberto Coppari, Gloria Ursino and Giorgio Ramadori (from left to right) are looking to develop complementary or alternative treatments that are more effective and less dangerous than Insulin therapy. (CREDIT: Université de Genève)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under healthy conditions, this is a survival mechanism. But when the body lacks insulin, as in type 1 diabetes, ketogenesis can spiral out of control. The blood turns too acidic, which leads to DKA. Each year, between 2–4% of people with &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/cutting-edge-discovery-looks-to-transform-type-1-diabetes-cancer-and-autoimmune-disease-care/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 1 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; end up in the hospital with DKA, and these emergencies can be deadly if not treated quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, the only reliable way to suppress excess ketones was through insulin. But insulin carries its own risks. Too much can lead to low blood sugar. Over time, it can damage fat metabolism and increase cholesterol levels. Insulin-dependent diabetics also tend to live 10 to 15 years less than the average person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A New Player: S100A9&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Roberto Coppari and his team have spent over ten years exploring how the body might survive without insulin. In 2019, they found a protein—S100A9—that could do something remarkable: it improved &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/first-ever-study-reveals-the-impact-of-weight-loss-and-blood-sugar-control-on-type-2-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, ketone levels, and lipid profiles in diabetic mice, all without insulin. More importantly, it didn’t trigger dangerous side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how this worked, researchers first had to uncover the exact pathway S100A9 followed. They found that the protein doesn’t enter liver cells directly. Instead, it works from the outside, activating a receptor called Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which sits on the surface of certain non-parenchymal cells in the liver. This activation leads to stimulation of a protein complex called mTORC1, which ultimately reduces ketone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pathway offered several key advantages. It’s independent of insulin, doesn’t cause inflammation (despite TLR4’s usual role in triggering immune responses), and may even offer anti-inflammatory benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These discoveries were detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31803-5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature Communications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt; study, where Giorgio Ramadori, a lead author and senior lecturer at the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine, helped guide the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“TLR4 activation in the liver controls the production of ketones,” explained Gloria Ursino, a postdoctoral fellow and first author of the study. “But this activation process does not trigger inflammation, whereas TLR4 is usually pro-inflammatory. The S100A9-TLR4 dialogue therefore seems to act as a totally unexpected anti-inflammatory drug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse collapsed"&gt;RIP- DTR mice were treated at day 0, 2, and 4 with DT and at day 8, were injected via tail vein with either saline (n = 5) or 0.6 mg/kg of r-hS100A9 (n = 8). Metabolic assessments were done 3 h after injection and food removal. Our model predicts that extracellular S100A9 activates non-parenchymal hepatic TLR4 signaling which consequently leads to several downstream events.

But this increase is not strong enough to control the &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/blood-test-accurately-predicts-dementia-140700947.html" data-ylk="slk:ketone surge;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ketone surge&lt;/a&gt;. That’s where additional doses of the protein could help. The idea is to supplement this protein with a subcutaneous injection of a lab-made version—recombinant S100A9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach has been tested in diabetic mice, and the results were promising. The protein reduced ketone levels and improved blood sugar without triggering hypoglycemia. In fact, even mice missing insulin-producing cells lived longer when treated with S100A9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with CHF 2.5 million in funding from the Helmsley Charitable Trust, Ramadori and his team are preparing for clinical trials. This grant will help finish preclinical studies and support the application process for human testing in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like these kind of stories?

But this approach still relies on insulin, along with all its risks. S100A9 works differently. It doesn’t boost insulin or help the body respond to it. Instead, it bypasses insulin entirely, opening a new door for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been other drugs that helped insulin work better,” said Coppari. “But this just meant patients could use smaller doses. The risks didn’t go away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Representative image of immunofluorescence in RAW264.7 cells expressing mCherry-TOSI treated incubated with 2μg/mL of r-mS100A9 or r-hS100A9.

Researchers plan to test it first in combination with low doses of insulin. However, in some cases, it could one day be used alone. That would be especially helpful for people who can’t produce insulin at all, like those who’ve had their pancreas removed or who have severe forms of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/a-daily-cup-of-tea-helps-reduce-type-2-diabetes-risk-study-finds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides helping manage diabetes, the S100A9 pathway may hold benefits for other conditions involving inflammation or poor metabolism. Because it works without triggering the body’s inflammatory alarms, it might offer a safer way to manage energy balance in many diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To push this innovation forward, Coppari and Ramadori have founded &lt;a href="https://www.diatheris.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Diatheris;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Diatheris&lt;/a&gt;, a startup company based in Geneva. Supported by the university’s technology transfer office, UNITEC, and FONGIT, which backs new technologies in the region, the company aims to develop S100A9 into a real-world therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;S100A9 suppresses diabetic ketogenesis via hepatic TLR4. (CREDIT: University of Geneva (UNIGE))&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ work could mark a turning point in the management of type 1 diabetes. Instead of relying on a century-old treatment with known risks, people could one day control their condition with a safer, more stable option.

In a unique study, participants took an immersive art tour and were later tested on their memory of both object features and event sequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While memory for visual details faded, memory for the sequence of events significantly improved after sleep. Brain recordings confirmed that deep sleep brainwaves—slow waves and spindles—were linked to this long-lasting memory boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sequence-Specific Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep enhanced memory for event order, not visual features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; A single night’s sleep improved sequential memory for up to 15 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Sleep Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Brainwaves during deep sleep were tied to stronger memory retention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Baycrest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While sleep’s positive impact on cognition has long been recognized, Baycrest researchers have revealed that a good night’s sleep may actively enhance memory rather than simply protect it from decline. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings are the first to reveal that sleep helps us better remember the order of events in our lives, even after more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While our memory for features such as object size and colour declines over time, sleep can improve our memory for event sequence,” says Dr. Brian Levine, Senior Scientist at the Rotman Research Institute, part of the Baycrest Academy for Research and Education (BARE) and senior author on this study, titled “Sleep selectively and durably enhances memory for the sequence of real-world experiences” and published recently in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study deepens our understanding of how critical sleep is for integrating experiences into memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most studies on human memory for events require participants to memorize items, such as words or pictures, in a laboratory setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in this study, Dr. Levine—along with then-graduate students Dr. Nicholas B. Diamond and Dr. Stephanie Simpson—designed a unique and immersive real-world experience in a 20-minute audio-guided tour of artworks displayed at Baycrest, a global leader in aging and brain health in Toronto, Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants took the tour and were tested on their memory at five delay intervals ranging from one hour to 15 months after the tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests included questions on the physical features of the artwork and the sequential order of tour items. The researchers found that sleep boosted memory for sequences, whereas memory for features declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm their findings, they ran a second study where participants were randomized to either a wake group or a sleep group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sleep group did the tour and first memory test in the evening and the second memory test after a night of sleep in a sleep laboratory with brain activity monitored with electroencephalography (EEG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wake group did the tour and first memory test in the morning and the second memory test in the evening after normal daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the long-term effects of sleep on memory, both groups completed additional memory tests one week, one month and 15 months following the tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main study findings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleep improved memory for the order of the tour items (sequences), but not memory for features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The advantage of sleep versus wake for sequential memory was evident after a single night of sleep, and this advantage held at all test points, including 15 months later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No such improvement was found for memory for features of the tour items, such as shape and colour, which continued to decline over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brain activity recordings in the sleep laboratory showed that specific brain waves during deep sleep – namely slow waves and spindles – were linked to overall memory enhancement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good sleep is an essential part of a healthy lifestyle, including for the brain and cognition. This study shows how deep sleep benefits memory for the sequential structure of everyday events, even when the specific details of those events fade with time, and points to a potential cause of memory changes in older adults living with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The benefits of sleep on memory are powerful; just one night makes a difference that persists over a year,” said Dr. Levine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fd93939c9e988b8e9694d0919c948f99bd9f9c849e8f988e89d3928f9a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natasha Nacevski-Laird&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://baycrest.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Baycrest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Natasha Nacevski-Laird – Baycrest&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02117-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sleep selectively and durably enhances memory for the sequence of real-world experiences&lt;/a&gt;” by Brian Levine et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep selectively and durably enhances memory for the sequence of real-world experiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is thought to play a critical role in the retention of memory for past experiences (episodic memory), reducing the rate of forgetting compared with wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet it remains unclear whether and how sleep actively transforms the way we remember multidimensional real-world experiences, and how such memory transformation unfolds over the days, months and years that follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an exception to the law of forgetting, we show that sleep actively and selectively improves the accuracy of memory for a one-time, real-world experience (an art tour)—specifically boosting memory for the order of tour items (sequential associations) versus perceptual details from the tour (featural associations).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This above-baseline boost in sequence memory was not evident after a matched period of wakefulness. Moreover, the preferential retention of sequence relative to featural memory observed after a night’s sleep grew over time up to 1 year post-encoding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, overnight polysomnography showed that sleep-related memory enhancement was associated with the duration and neurophysiological hallmarks of slow-wave sleep previously linked to sequential neural replay, particularly spindle–slow wave coupling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that sleep serves a crucial and selective role in enhancing sequential organization in our memory for past events at the expense of perceptual details, linking sleep-related neural mechanisms to the days-to-years-long transformation of memory for complex real-life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 21:20:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE1uN1pYUzVlUGNxcmxGelRmRFlEMFRwRFFwaDJjSXhVc1Q1YVFYT25aZ0p6eUJEQjdYaFloWTZOWlpYRURjU2ZNWEsybG13RTZCQ1ctSnBucnlxMUNKRks5SXcwSVRTdzhEVnlV</guid></item><item><title>Two measles cases reported in Arkansas | What we know - thv11.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxNRUZVUXlzTjkyOFptNUZMNDlNTmRIYl9pSFhDNXZhWWE4NTR5bjNheUZzbUZjNVlRS3RjcmtEN0UyYm9NZnB1bElGU05TRXI0N04tVjB6cHQ5Z245cmpFU25xMkNfRU1iLXpQVF9ERnZDeTJwczFONXhsWUIxdjBzdFNPNG9YSTdCdC1jcHVlYmhMQzF0SGN3bk9FdmExRUpoZGpleTJiSFptd2RCY1RrczJyVmpURWUwSGRJbVJqSVRqOWJrY3BkUFpn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;The Arkansas Department of Health announced that two positive cases of measles have now been identified in Central Arkansas. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SALINE COUNTY, Ark. — Officials with the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) have now announced two positive cases of measles in Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADH announced the first positive case on the afternoon of Thursday, April 10, when a positive case of measles had been identified in Saline County. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to ADH officials, the case was identified in an Arkansan who was unvaccinated against the illness. Additionally, they said that the Arkansan was exposed to the illness during a visit out of state. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this positive measles identification, the state of Arkansas hadn't seen a positive measles case since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADH said that the individual visited four different locations while infectious. Here's a look at the locations and the times that they visited each place: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Baptist Health Urgent Care on Military Road in Benton on April 6 between 3:30 to 6:09 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saline Memorial Hospital Emergency Department on April 6, between 6:30 to 10:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Benton Family Clinic on April 8 between 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arkansas Children’s Emergency Department on April 8 between 11:49 a.m. to 5:59 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours later, the ADH confirmed that a second positive case of pediatric measles had been confirmed in an unvaccinated Arkansas resident from Faulkner County.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports say that the child who tested positive was exposed during out-of-state travel. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The child reportedly visited the following locations while infectious: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arkansas Pediatrics of Conway on April 7, 2025, from 9:10 to 11:25 a.m. and 4:00 to 6:45 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arkansas Children’s Emergency Department on April 9, 2025, from 1:15 to 8:40 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADH officials confirmed that there have not been any reports of exposures at daycares or schools. They also encouraged people who visited any of the listed locations to visit a health care professional and receive an MMR vaccine to prevent the spread of the illness. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No exposures have been identified at daycares or schools. Anyone at any of the identified locations during those dates and times is urged to get up-to-date on the MMR vaccine as quickly as possible," ADH said in a press release. "If the MMR vaccine is given soon after exposure, it can stop the infection from developing. If someone is unable to receive the MMR vaccine, they should discuss options with their health care provider. The ADH and affected facilities will be contacting potentially exposed individuals." &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who may have been potentially exposed, here are the symptoms that ADH officials said that you should look out for: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conjunctivitis &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, health experts encourage anyone who has visited any of the locations listed above to monitor themselves for symptoms for 21 days after exposure. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the news of a positive case of measles in the state, the Arkansas Children's Hospital released the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Arkansas Department of Health notified Arkansas Children’s that a patient who visited Arkansas Children’s Hospital’s emergency room in Little Rock tested positive for measles," said the hospital. "Arkansas Children's encourages families to ensure they are up-to-date on their measles immunizations and to reach out to their primary care physician, pediatrician, pharmacy, or county health unit to schedule a measles vaccine, known as the MMR.” &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel as though you've been potentially exposed to measles, you can contact ADH at 1-866-940-7568.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

													WHAT’S THE LATEST? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO, ALLISON, THE ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH DIRECTOR SAYS THE CASE IS OUT OF SALINE COUNTY. THAT’S IN CENTRAL ARKANSAS, SOUTHWEST OF LITTLE ROCK. IT’S THE FIRST CASE REPORTED IN ARKANSAS SINCE 2018. AND THIS COMES AS AN OUTBREAK GROWS NATIONWIDE. NOW, THE DIRECTOR SAYS THE INFECTED CHILD TRAVELED OUT OF STATE. THEY’RE DOING CONTACT TRACING TO SEE WHO THEY MAY HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH WHEN THEY RETURNED. NOW, IN THE MEANTIME, THEY’RE ENCOURAGING ANYONE NOT VACCINATED TO DO SO. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WITH TWO DOSES OF THE VACCINE, THEN. ABOUT 97% OF THE PEOPLE WILL BE PROTECTED FROM ACTUALLY GETTING THE MEASLES. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOW, SHE SAYS, THIS VACCINE IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHERS, AND THAT’S IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF HOW EASILY MEASLES CAN SPREAD. SHE SAYS IF A PERSON WITH MEASLES ENTERS A ROOM, NINE OUT OF TEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN VACCINATED WILL CATCH THE DISEASE. NOW WE’RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THIS DEVELOPING STORY AND BRING YOU THE LATEST UPDAT

The case involves an unvaccinated child from Saline County who contracted the virus during out-of-state travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease that can lead to severe health complications. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis, and rash. The virus is infectious for four days before and after the rash appears. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine offers long-lasting protection against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infected individual visited several locations while contagious, including Baptist Health Urgent Care in Benton on April 6 from 3:30 to 6:09 p.m., Saline Memorial Hospital Emergency Department on April 6 from 6:30 to 10:30 p.m., Benton Family Clinic on April 8 from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., and Arkansas Children Hospital's (ACH) Emergency Department on April 8 from 11:49 a.m. to 5:59 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No exposures have been identified at daycares or schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ADH urges anyone who was at these locations during the specified times to ensure they are up to date on the MMR vaccine. Receiving the vaccine soon after exposure can prevent the infection from developing. Those unable to receive the vaccine should consult their healthcare provider for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ADH and affected facilities are reaching out to potentially exposed individuals. People who were at the listed locations during the specified times should monitor for symptoms for 21 days post-exposure. If symptoms develop, individuals should contact their healthcare provider by phone, mention potential measles exposure, and have the provider contact ADH at 1-866-940-7568.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arkansas Children’s has also set up a call line for families. If you believe you have been exposed during your visit, you can call the hospital at 501-364-8367.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Arkansas Children's encourages families to ensure they are up-to-date on their measles immunizations and to reach out to their primary care physician, pediatrician, pharmacy or county health unit to schedule a measles vaccine, known as the MMR," said Karen Farst, MD, Senior Vice President &amp;amp; Chief Medical Officer at ACH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who have received the MMR vaccine or were born before 1957 are generally considered immune.

These cells were highly engaged during precision tasks, like inserting the tongue into narrow tubes, but not during casual grooming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers suppressed these cells, the tongue overshot its target or slowed in retraction, revealing how crucial Purkinje cell activity is to coordination. The findings shed light on how the cerebellum contributes to precise motor control and could inform treatments for speech and swallowing disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motor Precision:&lt;/strong&gt; Purkinje cells in the cerebellar vermis signal to stop tongue movement near targets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; Suppressing these cells caused overreach or slowed tongue return.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Insights may aid therapies for speech, swallowing, and vocal disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By studying the skilled movements of marmoset tongues, researchers have discovered that Purkinje cells (P-cells) in a brain region called the cerebellum signal to stop protrusion as the tongue approaches its target, according to a study published April 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; by Reza Shadmehr from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, U.S., and colleagues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use our tongue to shape the air and generate sounds to communicate, and we use our tongue to evaluate food morsels and transport them through the oral cavity when eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108595"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person sticking out their tongue and neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results suggest that P-cells signal to downstream structures to stop the movement as the tongue approaches its target. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These skillful acts involve coordination of more than 100 muscles, producing movements that are fundamental to our existence. Damage to the cerebellum disrupts these movements, resulting in abnormal muscle activation patterns. Yet it has not been clear how the cerebellum controls tongue movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, Shadmehr and colleagues used an animal model that has a long tongue and can skillfully direct it to small targets. Marmosets have a 21mm tongue which they use to burrow into small holes and retrieve insects and sap. Indeed, they have an extraordinary ability to control their tongue, vocalizing to label other marmosets during two-way communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers observed that marmosets could naturally bend and twist their tongues and insert them into small tubes, even when the tubes were placed at sharp angles with respect to their mouths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify how the cerebellum contributes to the control of the tongue, the researchers recorded the activity of P-cells in a cerebellar structure called the vermis. When a P-cell was suppressed during protraction, the tongue’s trajectory became hypermetric, overshooting the intended target during movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the suppression took place during retraction, the tongue’s return to the mouth was slowed. Both effects were amplified when two P-cells were simultaneously suppressed. Suppression of P-cells in the vermis disrupted the forces that would normally decelerate the tongue as it approached the target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that P-cells signal to downstream structures to stop the movement as the tongue approaches its target. This strong engagement of the P-cells was present when the tongue was aiming for a small tube – a movement that requires precision — but not when the tongue was used to groom the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, treatments or cures for symptoms linked to cerebellar dysfunction, such as vocal muscle spasms, problems with swallowing, or speech disorders, will require a much better understanding of how the cerebellum contributes to the control and learning of tongue movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because marmosets are exceptionally skilled at shaping and twisting their tongues, using them almost like fingers, they are an attractive animal model to study the neural control of a body part that is essential for our existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add, “During dexterous licking, a climbing fiber induced suppression of Purkinje cells in the lingual vermis inhibited the forces that would otherwise retract the tongue, resulting in hypermetria during protraction and slowing during retraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because the direction of these forces aligned with the direction of motion specified by the olivary input, a pattern that is also present for P-cells in the oculomotor region of the cerebellum, the results imply a general computation for P-cells during control of targeted movements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (&lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;) (R01-EB028156 to RS, R37-NS128416 to RS) and the National Science Foundation (&lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/"&gt;https://www.nsf.gov/&lt;/a&gt;) (CNS-1714623 to RS).

For example, we use our hands to sense properties of objects and transport them in the nearby space, and we use our tongue to sense properties of food morsels and transport them through the oral cavity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what does the cerebellum contribute to control of tongue movements?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we trained head-fixed marmosets to make skillful tongue movements to harvest food from small tubes that were placed at sharp angles to their mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified the lingual regions of the cerebellar vermis and then measured the contribution of each Purkinje cell (P-cell) to control of the tongue by relying on the brief but complete suppression that they experienced following an input from the inferior olive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a P-cell was suppressed during protraction, the tongue’s trajectory became hypermetric, and when the suppression took place during retraction, the tongue’s return to the mouth was slowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both effects were amplified when two P-cells were simultaneously suppressed. Moreover, these effects were present even when the pauses were not due to the climbing fiber input. Therefore, suppression of P-cells in the lingual vermis disrupted the forces that would normally decelerate the tongue as it approached the target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the population simple spike activity peaked near deceleration onset when the movement required precision (aiming for a tube), but not when the movement was for the purpose of grooming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the P-cells appeared to signal when to stop protrusion as the tongue approached its target.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 20:35:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE1BR0FvSUVMVXVTY1ZOV2tPMXRMeWJ2c240YzY4dGswYmhxTXpGZnFqRE9idjVGYjZwWGFsWl90M0FXcHhNU29OQnNsWVdBVG5uemhTWTF1MElLZnc2dDBVTjliXzFYQ1VNclh3X0R6alNkbTlM</guid></item><item><title>Brain Circuit Discovery Links Cancer Fatigue to Inflammation - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE5Mb3V6NnZnd284NXhJN2wybWR1U1NWNXQxcFdiU3BCaVJXMHJqRHZiOHlJYm04d2ZPUXRUOFphUmhrVHdKaXJ3WmxRWUxseEQ0Skx5RHJ1MHhqSFVldk5OMThNeXJNajlfZkxOem5QaGg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research shows that apathy and fatigue in advanced cancer are driven not by physical decline, but by inflammation-sensing neurons that suppress motivation. Scientists discovered that inflammation triggers a brainstem-to-reward-center pathway that reduces dopamine, the brain’s key motivation chemical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking this pathway in mice restored their drive to act, even in late-stage cancer, despite ongoing weight loss and disease progression. The findings point to a potential new way to improve quality of life in patients by targeting brain inflammation directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Brain Pathway Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Inflammation-sensing neurons in the brainstem suppress dopamine release, reducing motivation in cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocking these neurons or using an IL-6 antibody restored motivation in mice with advanced cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; The same pathway may underlie apathy across other chronic inflammatory illnesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fatigue and lack of motivation that many cancer patients experience near the end of life have been seen as the unavoidable consequences of their declining physical health and extreme weight loss. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But new research from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis challenges that long-held assumption, showing instead that these behavioral changes stem from specific inflammation-sensing neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108591"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Treating the mice with an IL-6 antibody similar to an existing FDA-approved drug for rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory condition, also restored the animal’s motivation, a finding that points to a potential treatment for the psychological symptoms associated with advanced cancer. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published April 11 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers report that they identified a direct connection between cancer-related inflammation and the loss of motivation characteristic of advanced cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying mice with cancer-linked cachexia, a condition typical of the disease that leads to muscle wasting and weight loss, they discovered a previously unrecognized pathway in the brain. This pathway senses inflammation and actively suppresses dopamine — a key driver of motivation — resulting in apathy and loss of drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking the pathway restored motivation, even though the cancer and weight loss continued. This indicates that apathy can be treated separately from the disease itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The implications of the research are profound,” said the study’s lead author, Adam Kepecs, PhD, professor of neuroscience and of psychiatry at WashU Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve uncovered a direct brain mechanism through which inflammation drives apathy in cancer, and we were able to restore normal motivation in mice with cachexia, despite ongoing inflammation as cancer progressed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 70% of patients with advanced cancer experience cachexia. In addition to physical decline, patients often suffer from severe fatigue, apathy and a lack of motivation that affect their overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand whether these psychological symptoms are side effects that emerge from physical deterioration or whether they arise from distinct biological mechanisms, the research team, including Marco Pignatelli, MD, an assistant professor of psychiatry at WashU Medicine, and Tobias Janowitz, MD, PhD, an associate professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, turned to a well-validated mouse model of cancer cachexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They focused specifically on behavioral symptoms, which had not previously been investigated, and mapped the brain regions involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that a structure in the brainstem, a part of the brain that controls vital functions such as breathing and heart rate, acts as a sensor for inflammatory signals in the bloodstream, particularly a molecule called interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is elevated in cancer cachexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When IL-6 levels rise, neurons in this region of the brainstem transmit a signal through a defined pathway that suppresses dopamine release in a part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens, which is key for motivation and reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting drop in dopamine had the effect of making the mice less motivated to exert themselves to complete activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see if interfering with this response could treat the lack of motivation and apathy, Kepecs and his colleagues tried two different approaches: they boosted dopamine levels and blocked inflammation-sensing neurons in the brainstem. Both approaches eliminated or reduced apathy in the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating the mice with an IL-6 antibody similar to an existing FDA-approved drug for rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory condition, also restored the animal’s motivation, a finding that points to a potential treatment for the psychological symptoms associated with advanced cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s remarkable is that motivation was restored even in late-stage disease,” said Pignatelli. “It suggests we may be able to improve quality of life by targeting the brain circuit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For acute illnesses such as infections, this inflammation-driven reduction in motivation may be adaptive, helping the body conserve energy to fight off disease, Kepecs explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in chronic conditions such as cachexia, prolonged apathy — including a reduced drive to eat, move or engage socially – can become harmful, worsening health and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because IL-6 — the inflammatory molecule driving this effect — is elevated in many other conditions, and the brain regions involved are central to motivation, this same circuit likely contributes to apathy across a range of chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This gives us a new way to understand apathy in advanced cancer,” said Kepecs. “It’s not just a byproduct of physical decline, but a direct response to inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That means we can potentially target the underlying biology to improve motivation and quality of life — even when the cancer itself is no longer treatable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant P50 HD103525, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft grant DFG -STA 1544, LaCaixa, the Mark Foundation for Cancer Research grant 20-028-EDV, the Simons Foundation, Cancer Grand Challenges, NIH grant 1OT2CA278690-01, CRUK: CGCATF-2021/ 100019, and NIH/National Cancer Institute grant R37CA286477-01A1, Cancer Center Support grant 5P30CA045508, NIMH grant MH130610, the Taylor Family Institute for Innovative Psychiatric Research, the Hope Center Pilot Grant, the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience Small Grant, and the NARSAD Young Investigator Grant 27102 and P&amp;amp;S Fund, a WUSTL BJC investigator award and NIH grant DP1 MH14002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Cancer and neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#412b6f22293433222901363432352d6f242534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jessica Church&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wustl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WUSTL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jessica Church – WUSTL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adm8857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A neuroimmune circuit mediates cancer cachexia-associated apathy&lt;/a&gt;” by Adam Kepecs et al. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A neuroimmune circuit mediates cancer cachexia-associated apathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cachexia is a debilitating wasting syndrome that affects most advanced cancer patients, characterized by profound involuntary weight loss, muscle and fat depletion, and disrupted energy balance. Beyond physical decline, patients commonly experience severe fatigue, apathy, and depression that further diminish their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these pervasive neuropsychiatric symptoms, the biological mechanisms linking peripheral wasting to brain dysfunction and behavioral changes remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RATIONALE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systemic inflammation, marked by elevated circulating cytokines, is a key driver of cancer cachexia. Although inflammation could broadly compromise neuronal function, we hypothesized that it acts through specialized circuits that conserve energy during acute illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cancer, persistent activation of these circuits may drive chronic fatigue and depression, providing a mechanistic framework for how inflammation dynamically regulates motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate cachexia’s impact on motivation, we used an established preclinical model: mice subcutaneously implanted with colon adenocarcinoma cells (C26). Within weeks, the mice exhibited classical cachexia symptoms—weight loss, muscle wasting, and decreased feeding—accompanied by pronounced motivational deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A battery of behavioral assays uncovered specific deficits in effort-sensitive tasks such as patch foraging and progressive ratio tests. By contrast, tests of physical activity (open-field exploration), reward sensitivity (sucrose preference, a measure of anhedonia), and despair (tail suspension, forced swim tests) remained unchanged, although home-cage activity was reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This identifies a specific reduction in effort-based motivation, indicative of apathy and distinct from general weakness or anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive cytokine screen showed rising interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the blood and brain that paralleled cachexia progression. Whole-brain, cellular-resolution activity mapping and viral tracing uncovered a circuit originating in the area postrema, a circumventricular organ specialized for detecting blood-borne signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IL-6–sensing neurons in this region project to the parabrachial nucleus, which in turn activates the substantia nigra pars reticulata inhibitory neurons, ultimately suppressing dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Optogenetic stimulation of area postrema neurons rapidly suppressed accumbens dopamine release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal dopamine monitoring during cachexia progression revealed a progressive decline in accumbens dopamine that tracked with worsening motivational deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeting this IL-6–sensing pathway reversed cachexia-induced apathy. Blocking IL-6 with systemic antibodies, knocking down (genetic reduction of gene expression) IL-6 receptors in the area postrema, or ablating area postrema–to–parabrachial neurons each alleviated the motivational deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, boosting dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens—through optogenetic stimulation of dopamine neurons or local dopamine agonist infusion—restored motivation despite ongoing inflammation, even at late stages of cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified an immune-to-neural circuit through which inflammation drives motivational deficits in cancer cachexia. Area postrema neurons detect circulating IL-6 and relay this signal to the basal ganglia to suppress mesolimbic dopamine, thereby increasing effort sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This specialized interoceptive pathway demonstrates that inflammation engages discrete neural circuits rather than causing broad disruption and cumulative neural damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this circuit is likely adaptive during acute illness—conserving energy by dampening motivation—its persistent engagement in chronic conditions such as cancer cachexia is detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reveals that psychiatric symptoms such as apathy in cachexia are not secondary effects of physical decline but can arise directly from the same pathological mechanisms driving the illness itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeting this circuit through ablation of IL-6 sensing or boosting dopamine release relieved motivational deficits, opening therapeutic avenues for neuropsychiatric symptoms in cachexia and possibly other inflammatory conditions where IL-6 is elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, by quantifying effort sensitivity as a dimension of motivation that is measurable across species establishes that inflammation specifically drives apathy-like behavior, enabling clinical translation and treatments for inflammation-driven motivational deficits common to conditions ranging from cancer to depression.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 20:07:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5Mb3V6NnZnd284NXhJN2wybWR1U1NWNXQxcFdiU3BCaVJXMHJqRHZiOHlJYm04d2ZPUXRUOFphUmhrVHdKaXJ3WmxRWUxseEQ0Skx5RHJ1MHhqSFVldk5OMThNeXJNajlfZkxOem5QaGg</guid></item><item><title>Probiotics linked to reduced negative feelings, offering potential mental health benefits - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOeS1qSUwtcGpkWWo3YjFGNlgxNHRvOUtsckRkajF3TERmY21CcmlkSVdNMW9IM1hEeHhQMGc5c2MyVDhSUzlneDZtT1lNeVoyTDFhcTc4dTFOay1WYmwyVFp4WXN6dmNXcVBMdmp5eF9QcWcxVkNMVUtPc21VSXN4VjhmZVRDUGJMMXNxX1RhN24?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research by Katerina Johnson and Laura Steenbergen &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44184-025-00123-z" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;npj Mental Health Research&lt;/i&gt; shows that taking probiotics can help reduce negative feelings. They also investigated which people benefit most from these "good" bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Probiotics are "good" bacteria in the form of drinks or tablets that you can buy in the supermarket and are also found in foods like yogurts, fermented cheese and sauerkraut. There is growing interest in the possibility that probiotics improve not only gut health but also mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The gut–brain connection provides various routes through which bacteria in the gut can influence how we feel and behave, including via the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vagus+nerve/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vagus nerve&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; and hormones," says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Daily mood reports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While animal studies have previously found promising effects of probiotics on the brain and behavior, human studies have yielded inconsistent results. Johnson and Steenbergen therefore used a combination of methods to capture how probiotics might influence the ability to regulate our emotions and affect our moods. These included psychological questionnaires, daily &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mood/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt; reports and computer tasks testing how people process emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in young, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/healthy+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;healthy adults&lt;/a&gt; who took a probiotic (containing bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) daily for a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to use daily mood reports to assess the effects of probiotics. It clearly shows that probiotics can reduce negative feelings compared to a placebo. This could mean a reduction in feelings such as anxiety, stress, fatigue or depressive tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is striking that by simply asking participants how they were feeling each day, we could detect the beneficial effects of probiotics on mood," says Steenbergen. "In contrast, the standard psychological questionnaires that are common in this field were not sensitive enough to pick up these changes."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;No substitute for antidepressants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that it took about two weeks for the probiotics to improve negative feelings. It takes about the same amount of time for antidepressants to work, but whereas antidepressants tend to reduce both negative and positive mood, the results showed that the probiotics only reduced negative mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be a possible benefit, although the researchers stress that probiotics should not be considered a substitute for antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who would benefit most from probiotics?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the researchers observed the decrease in negative feelings, they were keen to explore whether they could predict who would benefit most from probiotics. "We found that various traits, most notably a propensity for risk avoidance, were associated with a greater effect of probiotics on mood," says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers found evidence that probiotics may affect the way participants process emotional cues. The participants who received probiotics were slightly more accurate at recognizing facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Probiotics could be used in a targeted way in the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many questions remain unanswered about how exactly probiotics work and their long-term effects. "Perhaps in the future &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/probiotics/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt; could be used in a targeted way as an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/early+intervention/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;early intervention&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the chances of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/negative+feelings/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;negative feelings&lt;/a&gt; progressing to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+health+conditions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental health conditions&lt;/a&gt; such as depression, though more research would be needed to confirm that," says Steenbergen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson and Steenbergen hope their findings will also spur other &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; researchers to include simple daily measures of mood in their studies. As they conclude in their paper, "In an attempt to delineate the complexity of the human brain and emotion, we cannot lose sight of asking the obvious. Sometimes the most simple questions reveal the most meaningful answers."&lt;/p&gt;

At the center of their discovery is a protein called S100A9, which has been shown to reduce dangerous levels of ketones in the blood—without relying on insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people living with type 1 diabetes or those with severe insulin deficiency, life depends on daily injections of insulin. While insulin therapy has saved millions of lives, it’s far from perfect. It’s difficult to dose, can cause serious side effects, and often leads to complications like hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening condition. Researchers at the University of Geneva are now working on a treatment that could support or even replace insulin in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="understanding_the_body_s_ketone_system"&gt;Understanding the Body’s Ketone System&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, your body creates &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/ketones-boost-brain-function-and-guard-against-diabetes-alzheimers/"&gt;ketones&lt;/a&gt; as a backup energy source during long periods without food. This process—called ketogenesis—happens in liver cells called hepatocytes. It turns fat into ketone bodies like acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate. These molecules travel through the blood and help fuel other tissues in the body, including the brain and muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Roberto Coppari, Gloria Ursino and Giorgio Ramadori (from left to right) are looking to develop complementary or alternative treatments that are more effective and less dangerous than Insulin therapy.

But when the body lacks insulin, as in type 1 diabetes, ketogenesis can spiral out of control. The blood turns too acidic, which leads to DKA. Each year, between 2–4% of people with &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/cutting-edge-discovery-looks-to-transform-type-1-diabetes-cancer-and-autoimmune-disease-care/"&gt;type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; end up in the hospital with DKA, and these emergencies can be deadly if not treated quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, the only reliable way to suppress excess ketones was through insulin. But insulin carries its own risks. Too much can lead to low blood sugar. Over time, it can damage fat metabolism and increase cholesterol levels. Insulin-dependent diabetics also tend to live 10 to 15 years less than the average person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_new_player_s100a9"&gt;A New Player: S100A9&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Roberto Coppari and his team have spent over ten years exploring how the body might survive without insulin. In 2019, they found a protein—S100A9—that could do something remarkable: it improved &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/first-ever-study-reveals-the-impact-of-weight-loss-and-blood-sugar-control-on-type-2-diabetes/"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, ketone levels, and lipid profiles in diabetic mice, all without insulin. More importantly, it didn’t trigger dangerous side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how this worked, researchers first had to uncover the exact pathway S100A9 followed. They found that the protein doesn’t enter liver cells directly. Instead, it works from the outside, activating a receptor called Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which sits on the surface of certain non-parenchymal cells in the liver. This activation leads to stimulation of a protein complex called mTORC1, which ultimately reduces ketone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pathway offered several key advantages. It’s independent of insulin, doesn’t cause inflammation (despite TLR4’s usual role in triggering immune responses), and may even offer anti-inflammatory benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These discoveries were detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31803-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt; study, where Giorgio Ramadori, a lead author and senior lecturer at the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine, helped guide the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“TLR4 activation in the liver controls the production of ketones,” explained Gloria Ursino, a postdoctoral fellow and first author of the study. “But this activation process does not trigger inflammation, whereas TLR4 is usually pro-inflammatory. The S100A9-TLR4 dialogue therefore seems to act as a totally unexpected anti-inflammatory drug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;RIP- DTR mice were treated at day 0, 2, and 4 with DT and at day 8, were injected via tail vein with either saline (n = 5) or 0.6 mg/kg of r-hS100A9 (n = 8). Metabolic assessments were done 3 h after injection and food removal. Our model predicts that extracellular S100A9 activates non-parenchymal hepatic TLR4 signaling which consequently leads to several downstream events.

But this increase is not strong enough to control the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-blood-test-accurately-predicts-dementia-risk-a-decade-early/"&gt;ketone surge&lt;/a&gt;. That’s where additional doses of the protein could help. The idea is to supplement this protein with a subcutaneous injection of a lab-made version—recombinant S100A9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach has been tested in diabetic mice, and the results were promising. The protein reduced ketone levels and improved blood sugar without triggering hypoglycemia. In fact, even mice missing insulin-producing cells lived longer when treated with S100A9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with CHF 2.5 million in funding from the Helmsley Charitable Trust, Ramadori and his team are preparing for clinical trials. This grant will help finish preclinical studies and support the application process for human testing in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Helmsley Charitable Trust is not only accelerating the progress of our project, but also broadening its scope and impact,” said Ramadori. “Beyond the financial support, it reflects a shared commitment to advancing medical knowledge and, more importantly, improving the lives of people affected by type 1 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="rethinking_insulin_therapy"&gt;Rethinking Insulin Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current diabetes research has mainly focused on improving &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/eating-2-cups-of-mangos-daily-could-help-prevent-diabetes-study-finds/"&gt;insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;—how the body responds to the hormone. But this approach still relies on insulin, along with all its risks. S100A9 works differently. It doesn’t boost insulin or help the body respond to it. Instead, it bypasses insulin entirely, opening a new door for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been other drugs that helped insulin work better,” said Coppari. “But this just meant patients could use smaller doses. The risks didn’t go away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Representative image of immunofluorescence in RAW264.7 cells expressing mCherry-TOSI treated incubated with 2μg/mL of r-mS100A9 or r-hS100A9.

Researchers plan to test it first in combination with low doses of insulin. However, in some cases, it could one day be used alone. That would be especially helpful for people who can’t produce insulin at all, like those who’ve had their pancreas removed or who have severe forms of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/a-daily-cup-of-tea-helps-reduce-type-2-diabetes-risk-study-finds/"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_bigger_picture"&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides helping manage diabetes, the S100A9 pathway may hold benefits for other conditions involving inflammation or poor metabolism. Because it works without triggering the body’s inflammatory alarms, it might offer a safer way to manage energy balance in many diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To push this innovation forward, Coppari and Ramadori have founded &lt;a href="https://www.diatheris.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Diatheris&lt;/a&gt;, a startup company based in Geneva. Supported by the university’s technology transfer office, UNITEC, and FONGIT, which backs new technologies in the region, the company aims to develop S100A9 into a real-world therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;S100A9 suppresses diabetic ketogenesis via hepatic TLR4.

&lt;p&gt;Word on the street (or internet, rather) is that a certain down-to-earth (quite literally) crunchy vegetable that’s usually the sidekick to peanut butter or a pile of Buffalo wings offers up a range of health benefits when juiced that beat out its fellow green superfoods (sorry, kale). And wellness influencers and celebrities—from Gwyneth Paltrow to Jennifer Aniston and Miranda Kerr—are &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/is-juicing-healthy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;juicing&lt;/a&gt; celery for its bloating-reducing, inflammation-fighting, and skin-enhancing effects. Its latest disciple? Amanda Seyfried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-exactly-is-celery-juice"&gt;&lt;span id="What_Exactly_Is_Celery_Juice"&gt;What Exactly Is Celery Juice?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Celery juice is the liquid extracted from the stalks of raw celery, leaving behind the fiber,” said Lisa Testa, MS, chief nutrition officer of Raw Generation. “This makes it very easy for your body to digest and absorb.” On the surface, celery doesn’t exactly scream mouthwatering or nutrient-rich, but the often-overlooked, yet adaptable green has a lot going for it. Christina Beer, PhD, senior research scientist at &lt;a href="https://healthyage.lifevantage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;LifeVantage&lt;/a&gt;, explained that celery juice is a micronutrient-dense beverage, packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support various bodily functions, like vitamin K (crucial for blood clotting and bone health), vitamin C (vital for immune function, collagen synthesis, and acting as an antioxidant), and potassium (plays a critical role in regulating fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle contractions). “Together, these nutrients contribute to overall health when consumed regularly in adequate amounts,” Beer said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-health-benefits"&gt;&lt;span id="What_Are_the_Health_Benefits"&gt;What Are the Health Benefits?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-can-support-digestive-health"&gt;&lt;span id="It_can_support_digestive_health"&gt;It can support digestive health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It turns out the gut loves some celery juice. “Although celery juice has reduced fiber content compared to whole celery, it still contributes to digestive health by supporting hydration and improving gut motility,” Beer said. “The fiber in celery, especially the soluble variety, has been linked to improved gut health by promoting regular bowel movements and supporting beneficial gut microbiota. The sodium content in celery is also thought to stimulate the production of gastric juices, which can enhance digestive efficiency.” When the gut can perform at its best, it means it’s putting the nourishing foods you eat to good use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Better gut health means better uptake of nutrients,” Testa said. “The chlorophyll in celery juice does this by restoring the hydrochloric acid balance in your stomach. This means your body can actually begin to utilize the healing nutrients found in foods.” But that’s not all—Testa said you can expect to see major improvement with issues like constipation, &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/dietician-reduce-bloating-hacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bloating&lt;/a&gt;, and water retention, as celery is naturally a diuretic (thanks to its high water content and phytonutrients that relax the muscles in the walls of blood vessels and &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/celery-juice-is-a-trendy-detox-drink-but-does-it-actually-have-benefits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-can-reduce-inflammation"&gt;&lt;span id="It_can_reduce_inflammation"&gt;It can reduce inflammation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If inflammation is on everyone’s FYP and considered public enemy number one, then celery juice is the superhero wellness enthusiasts say it is. “Celery contains bioactive compounds such as luteolin and apigenin, which have been shown to possess significant anti-inflammatory effects,” Beer stated. “These flavonoids can inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are linked to conditions such as cardiovascular disease and arthritis.” According to Beer, research shows that these compounds can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, which is particularly beneficial for preventing chronic diseases associated with long-term inflammation. Going back to the gut chat, celery juice’s anti-inflammatory qualities may also help reduce intestinal inflammation, which is a common symptom of conditions like irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-can-increase-hydration"&gt;&lt;span id="It_can_increase_hydration"&gt;It can increase hydration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: Celery is made up of mostly water, providing close to a half cup of it. And we all know that &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/hacks-to-stay-hydrated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;staying well-hydrated&lt;/a&gt; goes hand in hand with healthier skin, &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/the-everygirl-podcast-episode-46/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;digestion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/alisa-vitti-hormone-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hormone balance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/self-care-sleep-routine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;, and mood. “Celery juice contains around 95 percent water, making it an effective hydrator,” Beer said. By blending or juicing celery, a lot of that water is released, helping rehydrate the body. “Studies suggest that consuming water-rich foods like celery can improve hydration status, contributing to improved physical and cognitive performance,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another important factor of proper hydration is regularly replenishing &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/electrolytes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;electrolytes&lt;/a&gt;, especially when you engage in physical activities or experience excessive sweating due to hot weather or intense exercise. Sure, you can consume electrolytes in supplement form, but raw celery juice is naturally packed with them, specifically potassium and sodium. “Drinking raw celery juice is the much-healthier version of Gatorade,” Testa said. “Perfect for someone with an active lifestyle.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-can-improve-skin-health"&gt;&lt;span id="It_can_improve_skin_health"&gt;It can improve skin health &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Celery juice is also key for a glowing complexion (which is why it’s the first step in Seyfried’s beauty routine). “The high water and vitamin C content in celery juice can contribute to healthy skin by supporting collagen production and hydration,” Beer said. Testa added that celery juice is rich in vitamin C, which naturally brightens the skin, and its high antioxidant makeup reduces oxidative stress to the skin (AKA signs of aging). “It’s a super hydrator while also being naturally diuretic, which results in glowing skin with less puffiness, especially around the eyes,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-there-potential-side-effects"&gt;&lt;span id="Are_There_Potential_Side_Effects"&gt;Are There Potential Side Effects?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it’s generally safe for most people, there are some situations where erring on the side of caution is necessary. “Excessive consumption [of celery juice] may contribute to high sodium intake, which could affect blood pressure, particularly in individuals sensitive to salt or those with hypertension,” Beer warned. Those with kidney disease should be wary of the potassium in celery juice and the potential for its dangerous buildup, and individuals on diuretics or blood pressure medications can be at risk for dehydration or electrolyte imbalances because of its enhanced diuretic effects. Pregnant women and individuals with low blood pressure should also consult a healthcare provider before consuming large amounts of celery juice. While side effects of drinking celery juice are not common, Testa said it can cause digestive issues like gas or bloating until the body adjusts to the larger volume of raw nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, celery juice is generally safe to drink every day for most people, providing a highly Instagrammable and TikTok-worthy means of hydration (if you’re into that), not to mention nutrients like vitamins K and C and potassium. Exactly how much should you drink? &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/celery-juice-hydration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt; says it’s suggested that you consume one 16-ounce glass of celery juice every morning for at least one full week to reap many of the benefits. “While beneficial, celery juice should complement a balanced diet and not replace whole foods,” Beer said. “Moderation is key, and those with health concerns should consult a healthcare provider before consuming it daily.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-pros-of-drinking-it-versus-eating-celery-whole"&gt;&lt;span id="What_Are_the_Pros_of_Drinking_It_Versus_Eating_Celery_Whole"&gt;What Are the Pros of Drinking It Versus Eating Celery Whole?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both drinking celery juice and eating raw celery have their health perks, but their drawbacks depend on what your health goals may be. “Celery juice offers a concentrated source of nutrients and can provide rapid hydration, as it is made from the water-rich stalks of the vegetable,” Beer said. “Additionally, celery juice is often touted for its potential digestive benefits, as it can help stimulate gastric juices and promote bowel movement due to its high water content.” Because a lot of the fiber is removed when celery is juiced, Testa said it’s easier for the body to utilize quickly without much digestive work. She also stands by drinking celery juice over eating celery by the stalk since you’re able to get a much larger volume of the nutrients and electrolytes in celery when juiced. Beer agreed: “Because it is easier to consume in larger quantities, it may be more effective for people seeking an immediate boost of hydration, vitamins, and minerals like vitamin C, potassium, and folate.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, what are the trade-offs when choosing celery juice over whole celery? “While juice is more nutrient-dense per volume, it lacks the dietary fiber found in whole celery,” Beer pointed out. “Fiber is essential for gut health, contributing to digestive regularity and the maintenance of a healthy microbiome.” Moreover, consuming whole celery ensures the intake of this fiber, which helps with satiety and stabilizing blood sugar levels; the same can’t be said for a tall glass of celery juice. TL;DR: You can’t go wrong either way (heed the potential side effects above), but if you need a leg up in hydration, drink up. But if you’re lacking fiber (which most of us are) and reaching for a healthy snack to tide you over until your next meal, get chomping.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-is-the-best-time-of-day-to-drink-it"&gt;&lt;span id="When_Is_the_Best_Time_of_Day_to_Drink_It"&gt;When Is the Best Time of Day to Drink It?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But first, celery juice? While there’s no definitive scientific consensus on an optimal time to drink celery juice, Beer cited that many proponents of celery juice suggest consuming it in the morning on an empty stomach for several reasons: “Drinking celery juice first thing in the morning may support digestion and hydration after a night’s rest when the body is dehydrated. The high water content of celery juice can help replenish lost fluids, while its naturally occurring sodium and potassium balance may promote optimal electrolyte levels and aid in maintaining blood pressure.” Plus, the anti-inflammatory compounds found in celery, such as flavonoids and polyphenols, may be more effective when consumed before anything else, potentially enhancing their bioavailability and absorption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But from a scientific standpoint, Beer said drinking celery juice in the morning versus the afternoon or evening may not make much of a difference when it comes to its overall health benefits. “Nutrient absorption is primarily dependent on the consistency of consumption and dietary context rather than timing. Drinking celery juice at other times of day can still contribute to hydration, provide antioxidants, and support digestive health.” More than anything, the primary benefit of waking up and enjoying a celery juice might be psychological, as it creates a routine that can have a domino effect on other healthy habits (see: &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/wellness-stacking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;wellness stacking&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-should-you-look-for-in-celery-juice"&gt;&lt;span id="What_Should_You_Look_For_in_Celery_Juice"&gt;What Should You Look For in Celery Juice?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You may think celery juice is celery juice, but Testa emphasized that not all celery juice is created equal. “While Raw Generation celery juice is cold-pressed and immediately flash-frozen, which preserves all nutrients and enzymes of the juice, traditional store-bought celery juice is pasteurized or high-pressure processed, leaving it devoid of nutrition.” So when buying pre-made celery juice, look for products that are cold-pressed or fresh-pressed (read: avoid those that are pasteurized), organic, and free of added sugars, preservatives, or flavorings (celery should be the sole ingredient). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got a juicer handy at home, Testa suggested using one large bunch of celery stalks that are wide and lighter in color, which will give you a mild, less bitter flavor. If you’re not used to the salty, bitter-y, a-bit-grassy taste at first, you can add half of a lemon or one apple to sweeten it and make it more palatable. No juicer? Don’t fret. You can DIY celery juice by combining celery and filtered water in a  high-speed blender, then straining it through a cheesecloth or fine mesh strainer before serving. Or, simply add celery to your favorite smoothie recipe for an extra hydrating and nutrient-dense pick-me-up. &lt;/p&gt;

Navajo people — living with the extreme temperatures of the desert — relied heavily on its assistance, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But the program was gutted by HHS cuts. Nygren told ABC News he held out hope that Kennedy, made aware of its importance to Navajo Nation, might consider reinstating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;From the start of the layoffs, Kennedy has insisted that no “essential services” would be cut. “The cuts in all of our agency are not affecting science,” Kennedy told ABC News last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But the scope of the cuts — and the work impacted, from utility bill assistance on Navajo Nation, to research into black lung disease for coal miners, to a division that monitors lead exposure among children — has continued to dog Kennedy, raising questions about his oversight and involvement in the major restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In all, the tribal leaders were resoundingly appreciative of Kennedy's visit, which was part of his first major trip as HHS secretary. The trip focused on combatting chronic disease, with a heavy emphasis on the importance of healthy, unprocessed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;HHS Secretary Robert F.

While there, he toured the Osher Center for Integrative Health at the University of Utah, which is aiming to center healthy diet and exercise in the health care conversation, and got aboard their “food pharmacy,” which delivers prescribed healthy foods to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In Arizona, which passed a law to ban SNAP recipients from using the assistance for soda, Kennedy held a press conference with the legislators who championed the bill and toured a Phoenix health center that offers healthy cooking programs for local native communities. He also stopped in for a panel discussion at the 2025 Tribal Self-Governance Conference, sitting with tribal leaders including the chairwoman of the Wampanoag Tribe, which he fondly described spending time around during his childhood in Massachussetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;On Navajo Nation, the crowd that gathered at the foot of Window Rock, a memorial, commended him for his devoted attention to issues of outdated medical centers, lack of water infrastructure and inadequate access to healthy foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Processed food hurts all of us. It disproportionately injures Native people,” Kennedy told the group of Navajo leaders, who nodded in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But they also used the opportunity to tell Kennedy that they needed more support, not less — warning against the impact of his agency’s cuts. It was a conversation that Kennedy was receptive to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“We are all going back with a long laundry list of tasks that we need to perform. And I'm going to give you my commitment today that I am available and listening to you,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In an &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch-rfk-jr-s-first-tv-interview-as-hhs-secretary/" target="_blank"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with CBS News that aired on Wednesday, Kennedy struck a similar tone to what he told the tribal leaders on Navajo Nation — that he would look into cuts that he wasn’t aware of, and reinstate those that had disrupted “scientific research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"There's a number of studies that were cut that came to our attention and that did not deserve to be cut, and we reinstated them.
