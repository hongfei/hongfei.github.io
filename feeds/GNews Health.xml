							&lt;p&gt;Ever notice how certain hobbies get labeled as "nerdy" or "weird," while others are considered totally normal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about this lately because I keep running into people who apologize for their interests, like they're confessing to some embarrassing secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I know it's boring, but I really love bird watching."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Don't judge me, but I spend my weekends doing puzzles."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: those supposedly boring hobbies? They're often the ones that indicate a higher level of intelligence and cognitive ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you find deep satisfaction in any of these seven activities, there's a good chance you're operating at a higher cognitive level than most people around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Reading fiction for pleasure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people will tell you they "should" read more, but genuinely loving fiction is different from feeling obligated to finish that bestseller everyone's talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're someone who gets lost in novels, who thinks about characters like they're real people, who stays up too late because you need to know what happens next, you're exercising some serious cognitive muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newschool.edu/pressroom/pressreleases/2013/CastanoKidd.htm"&gt;Research from The New School&lt;/a&gt; found that reading literary fiction improves theory of mind, which is the ability to understand that others have beliefs, desires, and perspectives different from your own. This isn't just about empathy in some fuzzy, feel-good way. It's about sophisticated mental modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you read fiction, you're constantly making predictions, tracking multiple characters' motivations, holding complex plot threads in your working memory, and interpreting ambiguous social situations. Your brain is doing intense work that looks like relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've mentioned this before, but I keep a stack of novels next to my bed, and I've noticed something interesting: the weeks when I'm reading fiction consistently are the weeks when I'm better at navigating tricky conversations and understanding subtext in my own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiction readers are essentially running social simulations in their heads. That's not escapism, that's training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Playing a musical instrument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to play an instrument is one of the most cognitively demanding activities humans can engage in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about what's actually happening when someone plays music: they're reading symbolic notation, translating it into motor commands, coordinating both hands independently, listening to the sound they're producing, comparing it to an internal model of how it should sound, and adjusting in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if they're playing with others, they're also tracking what everyone else is doing and adjusting to stay synchronized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.11.627938v1.full"&gt;Studies using brain imaging&lt;/a&gt; have shown that musicians have enhanced connectivity between brain regions, particularly between areas responsible for motor control and auditory processing. The corpus callosum, which connects the brain's two hemispheres, is often larger in musicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what I find most interesting: it's not just about the technical skills. Music requires you to think both analytically and creatively at the same time. You're following rules while also interpreting and expressing emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That dual processing, that ability to be both precise and expressive simultaneously, translates to enhanced problem-solving in completely unrelated domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you genuinely enjoy practicing scales or working through a difficult passage, your brain is thriving on complexity that most people find frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Engaging in strategy games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it's chess, Go, complex board games, or strategic video games, if you love games that require planning several moves ahead, you're constantly exercising executive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These games aren't just about following rules. They require you to hold multiple possible future scenarios in your head simultaneously, evaluate them against each other, and make decisions based on incomplete information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes strategy games particularly interesting from a cognitive perspective is that they require you to model your opponent's thinking. You're not just planning your own strategy, you're thinking about what they think you're thinking, which requires sophisticated recursive reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think of gaming as a waste of time until I started paying attention to what was actually happening in my head during a complicated game. The mental workout is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find joy in the challenge of outthinking an opponent or solving a strategic puzzle, you're someone who thrives on cognitive complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Cooking elaborate meals from scratch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking might seem like a basic survival skill, but if you genuinely enjoy the process of creating complex dishes, you're engaging in a sophisticated form of problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about what goes into making a complicated recipe: you need to understand how different ingredients interact chemically, manage multiple timelines simultaneously, adjust for variables like humidity and altitude, taste and adjust seasoning based on sensory feedback, and adapt when something doesn't go according to plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8071848/#:~:text=Although%20not%20widely%20held%20within,fundamental%20to%20reaching%20psychosocial%20competence."&gt;Research has shown&lt;/a&gt; that cooking activates multiple brain regions simultaneously. You're using procedural memory, sensory processing, fine motor control, planning, and creativity all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's something deeper happening too. When you cook, you're essentially running a complex project with multiple dependencies, deadlines, and quality standards. The cognitive skills involved are remarkably similar to those required in project management or software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started paying attention to this when I was developing recipes for my work. The mental process of figuring out how to veganize a traditional dish requires understanding the functional role each ingredient plays, then finding plant-based alternatives that fulfill those same functions. It's applied chemistry and creative problem-solving combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're someone who finds meditation in chopping vegetables or satisfaction in perfecting a technique, you're drawn to the kind of hands-on problem-solving that requires both precision and adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Learning new languages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find genuine enjoyment in learning languages, not just because you need to for work or travel, but because you love the process itself, you're demonstrating cognitive flexibility that most people lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language learning requires you to rewire fundamental patterns in your brain. You're not just memorizing vocabulary. You're learning to think in structures that might organize reality completely differently from your native language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3583091/#:~:text=Today%2C%20more%20of%20the%20world's,one%20language%20while%20using%20another."&gt;Studies have consistently shown&lt;/a&gt; that bilingual and multilingual individuals have enhanced executive function, better attention control, and improved ability to switch between tasks. The constant practice of inhibiting one language while using another strengthens cognitive control mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what fascinates me most is the metalinguistic awareness that develops. When you learn how another language works, you start noticing patterns in your own language that were previously invisible. You become aware of language as a system rather than just a transparent medium for thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of pattern recognition and systematic thinking transfers to other domains. People who enjoy language learning tend to be better at recognizing structural similarities across different fields and applying knowledge from one context to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Pursuing photography as a creative practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photography might look like just pointing a camera and clicking, but if you're someone who genuinely loves the craft, you know it's about training yourself to see differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good photographers develop what's called "photographic eye," which is the ability to recognize visual patterns, anticipate moments, understand how three-dimensional reality will translate to a two-dimensional image, and make split-second compositional decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires simultaneously processing technical information (light, exposure, focus) while also thinking creatively about framing, storytelling, and emotional impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time walking around with my camera, and I've noticed that photography has changed how I perceive everything, even when I'm not shooting. I notice light quality, I unconsciously frame scenes, I'm more attuned to decisive moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That heightened perceptual awareness is a form of intelligence that doesn't show up on traditional tests but affects how you navigate and understand the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find joy in the challenge of capturing a fleeting moment or composing a compelling image, you're someone whose brain thrives on complex visual processing and aesthetic decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Writing for personal expression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you write regularly, not because you have to but because you genuinely enjoy it, you're engaging in one of the most cognitively demanding activities possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing requires you to translate nebulous thoughts into precise language, organize complex ideas into logical structures, anticipate how a reader will interpret your words, and revise based on that anticipation. You're essentially creating a mental simulation of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's something else happening too. When you write regularly, you're forced to clarify your own thinking. You can't hide fuzzy reasoning behind vague language when you're committing words to page. Writing makes intellectual sloppiness visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found that writing about topics forces me to understand them at a deeper level than I would otherwise. The act of explaining something reveals the gaps in my own knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're someone who journals, writes essays, or works on creative projects because you find the process itself satisfying, you're training yourself to think more clearly and communicate more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence isn't just about solving math problems or memorizing facts. It's about curiosity, pattern recognition, cognitive flexibility, and the ability to engage deeply with complex systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hobbies on this list require sustained attention, tolerance for difficulty, and genuine intellectual engagement. They're not passive entertainment. They're active cognitive workouts that happen to be enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If several of these activities bring you real joy, not just obligation or the sense that you "should" do them, you're probably operating with cognitive abilities that exceed most people around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smartest people I know don't necessarily have the highest test scores or the most degrees. They're the ones who remain genuinely curious, who pursue interests for their own sake, and who find satisfaction in activities that challenge them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your hobbies say a lot about how your brain is wired. If you're drawn to complexity, creativity, and continuous learning, trust that instinct. You're not wasting time. You're becoming smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;More Americans are receiving computed tomography (CT) scans than ever before, and while this technology &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/ct-scan-saves-lives"&gt;can save lives&lt;/a&gt;, some scientists are concerned that low doses of ionizing radiation could increase  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="181232" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, at an individual level, the theoretical risk of developing cancer from a CT scan is &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/medical-x-ray-imaging/what-are-radiation-risks-ct"&gt;thought to be very low&lt;/a&gt;, if it exists at all. Patients should not hesitate to undergo these tests if they are considered medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the number of CT examinations performed annually in the US has increased by more than 30 percent since 2007, and researchers suggest that unwarranted tests are exposing the population to unnecessary radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-are-hacking-bacteria-to-fight-cancer-then-self-destruct"&gt;Scientists Are Hacking Bacteria to Fight Cancer, Then Self-Destruct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in April, a team in the US and the UK predicted that low levels of ionizing radiation from CT scans could theoretically account for 5 percent of all new cancer diagnoses in the US. CT scans conducted in 2023 could be responsible for an estimated 103,000 future cases of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's based on some assumptions and historical data from high radiation events, but if right, it would put CT scans on par with other significant &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/radioactive-waste-exposed-children-in-missouri-to-cancer-risks-study-finds"&gt;risk factors for cancer&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heres-why-every-sip-of-alcohol-increases-your-risk-of-cancer"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, at least at a population level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CT is frequently lifesaving, yet its potential harms are often overlooked, and even very small cancer risks will lead to a significant number of future cancers given the tremendous volume of CT use in the United States," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; the international team of analysts, led by epidemiologist Rebecca Smith-Bindman from the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of now, these are just theoretical risks, but that doesn't mean they aren't worth considering. While scientists know that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2203/dose-response.07-013.Brooks"&gt;high doses of radiation cause cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6447446/"&gt;conclusive evidence&lt;/a&gt; to link low-level radiation to cancer is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential association is &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/prehospital-and-disaster-medicine/article/risk-of-cancer-from-ct-scans-and-other-sources-of-lowdose-radiation-a-critical-appraisal-of-methodologic-quality/23464B0D825CD456741B77476F9997F7"&gt;mostly based&lt;/a&gt; on long-term studies of atomic bomb survivors and those exposed to nuclear power plant meltdowns. For instance, in a group of &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/radiation-risk-from-medical-imaging"&gt;25,000 Hiroshima survivors&lt;/a&gt;, who received a dose of ionizing radiation on par with three or more CT scans, there was a slight but significant increase in cancer risk across a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether those results extend to CT scans remains &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2672242/"&gt;hotly debated&lt;/a&gt;, and the theoretical risks must be weighed against the benefits of this technology, which can now alert patients and doctors to a whole variety of hidden diseases and injuries with very low doses of radiation (about the same amount &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org.au/iheard/can-radiation-from-medical-tests-cause-cancer"&gt;you absorb from your environment&lt;/a&gt; over three years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171762" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171762" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-642x444.jpg" alt="A patient undergoing a CT scan, with a technician present" class="size-medium wp-image-171762" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-642x444.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-600x415.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-768x532.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171762" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The theoretical risks of CT scans must be weighed against the benefits.

Using statistics from 2016 to 2022, researchers predicted 93 million CT examinations were carried out in 2023, on roughly 62 million patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the associated radiation risks, the team estimates that CT scans in 2023 may be tied to 103,000 future cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To empirically quantify lifetime risk would require decades-long follow-up studies of very large populations," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505"&gt;acknowledge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, their results suggest that some people may be more susceptible to cancer from low-dose ionizing radiation than others.

In support, the World Health Organization (WHO) is deploying an initial team of responders and delivering medical supplies to assist in the ongoing efforts to determine the cause of infection and halt further transmission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, eight suspected cases have been reported. Laboratory testing is ongoing at the Ethiopia Public Health Institute to determine the exact cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support the national authorities, WHO is deploying a multi-disciplinary team of 11 technical officers with experience in responding to viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks to help strengthen disease surveillance, investigation, laboratory testing, infection prevention and control, clinical care, outbreak response coordination and community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO is also providing essential supplies including personal protective equipment for health workers and infection-prevention supplies, as well as a rapidly deployable isolation tent to bolster clinical care and management capacity. Additional technical capacity is being mobilized to support the overall response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has also released US$ 300 000 from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to provide immediate support to the national authorities.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral haemorrhagic fevers refer to a group of epidemic prone diseases that are caused by several distinct families of viruses. They include Marburg and Ebola virus diseases, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever and Lassa fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific signs and symptoms vary by the type of viral haemorrhagic fever, but initial signs and symptoms often include marked fever, fatigue, dizziness, muscle aches, loss of strength and exhaustion. All cases of acute viral haemorrhagic fever syndrome whether single or in clusters, should be immediately notified without waiting for the causal agent to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

As this evidence stacks up, scientists have accelerated calls for a vaccine that targets the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-735484" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we now better understand how this fastidious virus is responsible for autoimmune diseases, I think it’s time to figure out how to prevent it,” said Dr. Anca Askanase, clinical director of the Lupus Center at Columbia University, who wasn’t involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bd42ea" class="body-graf"&gt;In lupus patients, an autoimmune attack can result in extreme fatigue, joint pain and skin rashes. In rare cases, the disease may lead to fatal or life-threatening issues such as kidney damage, or weaken the immune system so the body can’t fight off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b10a42" class="body-graf"&gt;Scientists have long suspected a link between Epstein-Barr and lupus, but the exact connection had remained elusive. Dr. William Robinson, a co-author of the new study and chief of the division of immunology and rheumatology at Stanford University, said his new findings solve a major piece of that puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ec1d19" class="body-graf"&gt;“From our perspective, it’s the key, missing mechanistic link,” Robinson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6f7c1c" class="body-graf"&gt;“We think it applies to all lupus cases,” he added. Hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. are living with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-72aeb5" class="body-graf"&gt;But Hoang Nguyen, assistant vice president of research at the Lupus Research Alliance, said it’s too soon to know if the mechanism is behind every case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-36a76f" class="body-graf"&gt;“Although the evidence is intriguing and promising, more evidence is needed to demonstrate that the link to EBV applies to all lupus,” Nguyen said. The alliance is a private funder of lupus research and contributed grant funding to Robinson’s study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-860ed7" class="body-graf"&gt;An infection withe Epstein-Barr virus does not necessarily cause symptoms, especially among children, though the virus is also the most common cause of mononucleosis (often referred to as mono).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4721a" class="body-graf"&gt;It's primarily transmitted by saliva from kissing or sharing drinks, food, utensils or toothbrushes. After someone is infected, the virus lingers permanently in the body, where it usually remains inactive — though not always. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b388f" class="body-graf"&gt;The new study is not the first to tie Epstein-Barr to autoimmune issues. Past research has &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/study-suggests-epstein-barr-virus-may-cause-multiple-sclerosis" target="_blank"&gt;linked it to multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;. Though not the sole trigger of MS, the virus may be part of a chain of events that leads to the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6ef538" class="body-graf"&gt;Robinson said a pathway similar to the one described in his new study could also lead to other autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease, but more research is needed to tease that out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e018b2" class="body-graf"&gt;Of course, the vast majority of people who contract Epstein-Barr do not go on to get lupus, MS or any other autoimmune disease. Robinson said it’s possible that only certain strains of Epstein-Barr trigger autoimmune reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d9dbd6" class="body-graf"&gt;To determine the causal link between Epstein-Barr and lupus, Robinson and his co-authors focused on B cells — white blood cells that help fight off infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c0c09a" class="body-graf"&gt;Even in healthy individuals, Epstein-Barr lies dormant in a tiny portion of B cells. But those virus-containing B cells are far more prevalent in lupus patients, who have a 25 times higher share of them, according to the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8731d" class="body-graf"&gt;The study also highlights a type of protein called antinuclear antibodies, which bind to the nucleus of cells and are one of the hallmarks of lupus. The researchers found that Epstein-Barr infects and reprograms B cells to produce antinuclear antibodies that attack the body’s own tissue, thereby causing lupus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d2cba9" class="body-graf"&gt;Robinson said the findings go hand-in-hand with some other theories about what causes lupus. For instance, scientists suspect that a person’s genetics or hormones can predispose them to the disease, as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f2aeb" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07627-2" target="_blank"&gt;study published last year in the journal Nature&lt;/a&gt; also found that people with lupus have too much of a particular T cell — another type of white blood cell — that’s associated with cell damage and too little of another T cell associated with repair. Robinson said the pathway described in his study could &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/scientists-say-identified-root-cause-lupus-rcna160862" target="_blank"&gt;activate that T cell response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b7edf1" class="body-graf"&gt;The new research points to a few potential options for lupus treatment, according to Robinson, who is the co-founder of two drug development companies exploring treatments for autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-27444c" class="body-graf"&gt;Many of the current medications given to ease lupus symptoms, such as corticosteroids, broadly focus on reducing inflammation. Robinson said future therapeutics could specifically target B cells infected with Epstein-Barr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bdd93a" class="body-graf"&gt;But an Epstein-Barr vaccine — several of which are in clinical trials — could someday stop infections in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-33bf99" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Vaccination to protect people against ever being infected by EBV would be the ultimate, fundamental solution,” Robinson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOeTRZd0ZiX3F6ZU40LVUwN3VPZ2twRlV1Rzh4cWFrbUstMzloSEh6a1dnbHRBUWpmVW42SF9Lazg0aGNlakZoeVoxdHlWMEhKVVFfY0xDNnBXNVVWcGFfUVRiQlp3MzFWSlNJcG5YM25lQkF5RUdOOG9kQThmaFV0Y21XQmJIa0tOZlJFMDdrUnJ3U2pT0gFWQVVfeXFMTnh1UGJXWHg0SXc1YnZzUnZmTmpQUThWZ1FGbXV1cjV3M25FYUd3NEhEc1dhbWRzZDdkX2VjbkUxa1VIZV9sNVpGR2xsbjFCU3dmNHJiNFE</guid></item><item><title>密歇根州神经外科医生分享与更年期相关的鲜为人知的认知风险： “雌激素保护脑细胞免受……” |健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/michigan-neurosurgeon-shares-lesser-known-cognitive-risk-linked-to-menopause-101763023377236.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storyMainDiv" class="fullStory tfStory current videoStory story__detail storyAf101763023377236 " data-vars-storyid="101763023377236" data-story-section="lifestyle" data-story-subsection="health" data-vars-author="Eshana Saha" data-premium-story="false" data-performance-type="not-set" data-story-title="Michigan neurosurgeon shares lesser-known cognitive risk linked to menopause: ‘Oestrogen protects brain cells from…’"&gt; &lt;p class="htEchoTopPageBanner dHide"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="stickyCard"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h1 class="hdg1"&gt;Michigan neurosurgeon shares lesser-known cognitive risk linked to menopause: ‘Oestrogen protects brain cells from…’&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;div class="actionDiv flexElm topTime"&gt; &lt;p class="dateTime secTime storyPage"&gt;Published on: Nov 13, 2025 02:44 pm IST &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="googleFollow mHide"&gt; &lt;button class="htEchoShareBarDesk"&gt;&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2 class="sortDec"&gt;While common symptoms of menopause like heat flashes, mood swings and fatigue are widely discussed, Dr Jagannath draws attention to how it affects the brain.&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div class="storyDetails taboola-readmore"&gt; &lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/michigan-neurosurgeon-shares-lesser-known-cognitive-risk-linked-to-menopause-101763023377236.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/menopause" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Menopause"&gt;Menopause &lt;/a&gt;marks a major transition in a woman’s life, often accompanied by symptoms like hot flashes, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiac-surgeon-shares-7-subtle-signs-of-heart-failure-that-most-people-ignore-until-too-late-fatigue-bloating-more-101762677511972.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="fatigue"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, and mood swings.

Dr Jagannathan discusses the crucial role of oestrogen in cognitive function - and how its decline during menopause can affect the brain. He explains, “Oestrogen isn’t just a reproductive hormone - it’s a neuroprotective shield. It helps regulate blood flow, reduce inflammation, and protect brain cells from stress. So when oestrogen levels drop, that protection weakens.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hidden health risks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Dr Jagannathan, the decline in oestrogen plays a major role in raising cognitive health risks for women after menopause. Consequently, the likelihood of the following issues rises during and after this stage:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Silent strokes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Memory decline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Increased risk of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/festivals/neuroscientist-shares-3-major-risk-factors-for-developing-alzheimers-disease-vitamin-deficiency-inflammation-more-101762864342370.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Alzheimer’s"&gt;Alzheimer’s &lt;/a&gt;and cognitive fog&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/13/original/menopause_graphic_1763023653076.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Dr Jagannathan highlights 4 ways you can reduce the risk of cognitive decline during menopause.(Image generated via ChatGPT)" title="Dr Jagannathan highlights 4 ways you can reduce the risk of cognitive decline during menopause.(Image generated via ChatGPT)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Dr Jagannathan highlights 4 ways you can reduce the risk of cognitive decline during menopause.(Image generated via ChatGPT)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to reduce risks?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The neurosurgeon states, “Your brain health is deeply connected to your hormonal health.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it could “reverse the hard won gains”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, $5.9bn was available for prevention, diagnosis and treatment, far below the annual target of $22bn by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Declines in the global burden of TB and progress in testing, treatment, social protection and research are all welcome news after years of setbacks, but progress is not victory,” the WHO chief said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that TB continues to claim over a million lives each year despite being preventable and curable is simply unconscionable,” Tedros added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although TB deaths in 2024 were 29 percent lower than those recorded in 2015, the WHO had hoped to reduce this figure by 75 percent by 2025 and 90 percent by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of deaths could even rise in the years ahead, warned Tereza Kasaeva, director of WHO’s division for tuberculosis, HIV and related infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long-term cuts to international donor funding could result in up to 2 million additional deaths and 10 million people falling ill with TB between 2025 and 2035,” Kasaeva said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency was dealt a significant financial blow when the United States withdrew from it in January, forcing a 21 percent cut to its proposed spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision by US President Donald Trump’s administration to slash foreign aid, particularly from the US Agency for International Development, has also raised fears about global TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, critical international aid helped to prevent 3.65 million deaths from the disease, according to the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 08:37:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

It’s just dehydration, doctors at a busy &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-hampshire/index.html" id="mol-e4d6ee90-bfcc-11f0-9676-938fb839d8a8" class=""&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; emergency department assured her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the next morning, when Ladner woke up, she couldn’t move her legs at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was terrified,’ she told Daily Mail. ‘It was the worst feeling I have ever experienced.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rushed back to the hospital, where doctors tested the reflexes in her knee, only to find her leg didn't move.

Ladner is shown by the red circle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ladner said: 'I felt scared. I felt kind of helpless when doctors told me I might never walk again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But then, at the same time, I felt like, motivated, from that, that it was going to get better, and I was going to defy those odds and that, if anyone was going to be able to do it, it was going to be me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After receiving her diagnosis of GBS, Ladner's&lt;span&gt; situation worsened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told Daily Mail: 'It was spreading quickly [the numbness]. They wanted it to stop, because... it can spread all the way up [your body], you can become paralyzed everywhere, and people have to be on ventilators.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GBS is a rare autoimmune disorder where immune system cells misfire and target the peripheral nerves in the arms and legs, causing them to stop transmitting signals properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early stages, patients feel a tingling or numbing sensation in the affected limbs before losing the ability to move altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear what causes the condition, but doctors say it may be triggered by the immune system misfiring after attacking a common viral infection that the patient may not even know they had, such as the flu, Covid or Epstein Barr Virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Proteins in the viruses are similar to those on nerve cells, scientists say, which can confuse the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The tingling turned to numbness and, by the next morning, she was no longer able to walk. Ladner was rushed to the hospital, shown, for treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a rare reaction, however, with only about 3,000 to 6,000 cases diagnosed in the US every year. The disease can strike at any age, but it is slightly more common among older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 80 percent of GBS patients are able to walk independently six months after their diagnosis, while 60 percent fully recover their muscle abilities within a year, according to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20363006"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physicians say many patients recover because of the intensive treatments offered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About five to 10 percent&lt;span&gt; have very delayed or incomplete recovery, suffering from complications including paralysis, while less than two percent die as a result of the condition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Ladner's case, doctors infused the patient with &lt;/span&gt;immunoglobulin, proteins in the blood that fight infections, from a healthy donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although it is not a cure for GBS, physicians say it may help because the healthy plasma could contain substances that neutralize antibodies that are causing the body to attack its own nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eight hours later, Ladner had a second infusion, and said that the numbness then stopped advancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with GBS, she suffered from aspetic meningitis, inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. This is not caused by GBS, but can be triggered as a result of blood plasma infusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite the odds and concerns she would never walk again, she overcame them and has now run in three marathons. She is pictured above while competing in the New York City marathon this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the treatments worked and her numbness started to ease, Ladner, her doctors and her family breathed a sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while the paralysis wasn't advancing anymore, the virus had severely damaged the nerves in her legs, leaving her with almost no movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She remained in the hospital for several weeks, during which doctors worked to help her gradually regain the ability to climb out of bed and walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was then transferred to a rehabilitation facility, where she remained for several more months working with physical therapists, who helped her walk, run, climb and even kick a soccer ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was discharged in January 2018, eight months after her symptoms first emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today, Ladner says her immune system remains 'weak', and that she frequently contracts viruses like the common cold or flu, but that her athletic ability is much improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as returning to the soccer field, she also found a passion for running after moving to New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Joining New York Road Runners, a nonprofit that promotes running to boost health, she has now competed in three marathons and hopes to do more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She completed the Nashville marathon in April last year, and has now run the New York City marathon twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She still thinks back to her condition, however, fearing that it could return, but also using it to help motivate her to run more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said:&lt;span&gt; 'People always ask me, why am I motivated to run? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'And I really think that it's my like, having had Guillain-Barré, and having been told that I was never going to... be able to walk again, that motivates me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because, you know, there was a time when I was laying in a hospital bed unable to walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And so, even on the days when I'm like, not motivated, or when the training gets hard...  I think back to a time when I would have wished that I could have been doing what I am doing now. It helps me and pushes me to finish.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 05:16:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNWFFYVzNpYk9zTWFBVEhfNnMyQTJCSVlFYmZwb0F2R1ltQkxlblhxcmZ0OGJSZEYzRmZ1ZXhIYU5IdUtZX25GUjhHUVdzaEN0OVNDNFFoTWg1OFVyUzRvQmE5Z3ktbTI2VmlyUHA2ZzhadWtXUzkxQW1hck45eW04eFpCMU9EVkh4NTJ1RlA1UTVtMFAtUGxNUHE5RkpSZXJq0gGmAUFVX3lxTE8wZUJ4V2RCMzlsSG03NGhpWlp2TWhXZnhQdGd3SFVULVoza0hmOTg0RDBnVXNpS0p2el9SQ09WeEo0QVZhTzI0UjF6WGhId1p6eUxrck5obmgtNlFZbUU2aHNsbi10T3lDNDNtRTRCbUlTb0ZpVXZrWWc1QlRuMkJIYUhiQ2Z2QmI3LUw4cmFhRHEyNmVUY3RCbVIwdkRtVlFkaWstcUE</guid></item><item><title>告诉《华盛顿邮报》：您是否正在为更年期或围绝经期而苦苦挣扎？ -《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/12/menopause-perimenopause-experiences/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PTNO4LJZ3JAYHNRZC6Z7KDA3YQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Washington Post wants to hear about your experiences navigating health care with perimenopause and menopause.

The findings, based on a meta analysis of data from 96 studies involving more than 400,000 children across 21 countries, &lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(25)00281-0/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;were published in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The review suggests obesity was a “substantial driver” of the sharp uptick in childhood hypertension, with nearly 19% of those living with obesity affected by the condition, compared with fewer than 3% in children and teenagers considered a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The nearly twofold increase in childhood high blood pressure over 20 years should raise alarm bells for healthcare providers and caregivers,” said study author Prof Igor Rudan, the director of the Centre for Global &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Research at Edinburgh University’s Usher Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study also suggests a further 8.2% of children and teenagers have prehypertension, meaning blood pressure levels are higher than normal but do not yet meet the criteria for hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prehypertension is especially prevalent during adolescence, with rates reaching 11.8% among teenagers, compared with about 7% in younger children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Doctors said blood pressure levels rose sharply in early adolescence, peaking about the age of 14, especially among boys. This underlined the critical importance of regular screening during these critical years, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="79b1baab-ee9b-44d1-86a9-75e094011fb9" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":8,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Junk food leads to more children being obese than underweight for first time","elementId":"79b1baab-ee9b-44d1-86a9-75e094011fb9","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/sep/10/junk-food-upf-more-children-obese-than-underweight-unicef"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Children and teenagers with prehypertension are more likely to progress to full hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Steve Turner, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, who was not involved with the review, said: “This sharp rise in high blood pressure among children is deeply concerning and largely driven by increasing childhood obesity – an entirely preventable condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“These findings mirror what paediatricians are seeing on the frontline. Children are presenting not only with hypertension, but also other serious conditions linked to obesity such as type 2 diabetes – once unheard of in children – asthma and mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We know that persistent hypertension is a risk factor for an early death due to damage to the cardiovascular system and other organs. Healthy children grow into healthy adults, but with trends like these, I fear that without urgent action we are hurtling towards a public health emergency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The rate of children and teenagers experiencing high blood pressure globally nearly doubled between 2000 and 2020, according to the meta analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2000, about 3.2% of children had hypertension, but by 2020, the prevalence had increased to more than 6.2% of children and teenagers under 19, affecting 114 million young people across the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Study author Dr Peige Song, of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, said the uptick in cases was “driven largely by lifestyle factors such as unhealthy diets, decreased physical activity, and the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Hypertension in children and adolescents has emerged as a substantial public health concern,” she said, adding that parents had a pivotal role in preventing and managing high blood pressure in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Promoting healthy habits, such as a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains while minimising salt and sugar intake, can substantially reduce the risk of hypertension. Encouraging regular physical activity and limiting sedentary behaviours, such as excessive screen time, are equally crucial,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“For families with a history of hypertension, regular blood pressure monitoring for children is strongly recommended. Early detection of elevated blood pressure, particularly through home monitoring, can help mitigate the risk of long-term complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Bryan Williams, the chief scientific and medical officer of the British Heart Foundation, who was not involved with the review, said he was very concerned about the rise: “Elevated blood pressure in childhood often persists into adulthood, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke later in life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The good news was that obesity-related high blood pressure could be reversed, he said. But bold action was also needed from governments to prevent so many children from having obesity in the first place. “This includes expanding restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy products and exploring further measures to drive the food industry to make our everyday foods healthier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 00:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPbFNWaHY2TlVWNFNWSGZxZ0ZWR3QxcFoyQUxaTHNLa3RRX3VqY3JZNDFKMTh1QmdhX2FNUC1HcjFxTkxxVjFmTmFWeWp2T2lmQndPbFJTZjFoLTBvS3gwTldUaXgzamUyNVdkc3JTNVdFOFVBNXNzTlp2bEV2V2tNV1gtNjUwWWNpUDN3eF9QQkxGWjhhamhvMlp3RnV5cy1yRFhuN3BHYXU</guid></item><item><title>裂孔性疝气是什么感觉？ 50岁以上的女性不应忽视的4个症状-女性世界</title><link>https://www.womansworld.com/wellness/hiatal-hernia-symptoms-and-treatments-for-women-over-50</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body class="post-template-default single single-post postid-591114 single-format-standard post-hiatal-hernia-symptoms-and-treatments-for-women-over-50 theme-womans-world has-custom-search article-format-posts" id="readabilityBody"&gt;

            Global rates of hypertension, or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/10/health/childhood-obesity-cognitive-decline-wellness"&gt;high blood pressure, in childhood&lt;/a&gt; and adolescence have nearly doubled since 2000, putting more kids at risk for poor health later in life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge7900083b6nsaiqi8jn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In 2000, about 3.4% of boys and 3% of girls had hypertension. By 2020, those numbers had risen to 6.5% and 5.8% respectively,” said Dr. Peige Song, a researcher from the School of Public Health at Zhejiang University School of Medicine in China. Song is one of the authors of a study describing the findings that published Wednesday in the journal The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge7900093b6n6ea4r93c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children who have hypertension could be at greater risk later on of developing heart disease –– &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm" target="_blank"&gt;the No. 1 cause of death&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, said Dr. Mingyu Zhang, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000a3b6nd46b1zll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The good news is that this is a modifiable risk,” Song said in an email. “With better screening, earlier detection, and a stronger focus on prevention, especially around healthy weight and nutrition, we can intervene before complications arise.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000b3b6n4hcld71t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rise in hypertension in children is likely due to many factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000c3b6nu1288h8z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Childhood obesity is a significant risk factor, because it is associated with factors like insulin resistance, inflammation and vascular function, Song said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000d3b6n52urp9lc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dietary factors such as consuming high levels of sodium and ultraprocessed food can also contribute to hypertension risk, as well as poor sleep quality, stress and genetic predisposition, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000e3b6nz52l7v5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many children also get less movement than past generations and spend more time on sedentary activities, like screen use, which may be affecting risk, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000f3b6npefll77w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are also starting to know that other factors, including environmental pollutants, can contribute,” Zhang added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw7fvby00023b6n82iayngg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Zhang served as senior author on &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/health/pfas-blood-pressure-teens-wellness" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;a previous study&lt;/a&gt; that showed a connection between prebirth exposure to chemicals called PFAS — a class of about 15,000 human-made compounds linked to cancers, endocrine-related conditions and developmental issues in children — and childhood hypertension. Short for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFAS are sometimes called “forever chemicals” because they don’t fully break down in the environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000g3b6nnzu0m8du@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The biggest takeaway of this research for families is not to assume high blood pressure is only a problem for adults, Song said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000h3b6ntmk3wskw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are worried about your child’s risk for obesity or hypertension, pressure, shame and restriction are not the best approaches.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000i3b6ng2y4iswg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, focus on increasing healthy behaviors in a happy way, said Jill Castle, a pediatric dietitian in Massachusetts, in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/13/health/kids-size-health-wellness"&gt;a previous CNN article&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000j3b6nrto53sp5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The goal of the food pillar is really to embrace flexibility with food and to emphasize foods that are highly nutritious and … to allow foods also that might be minimally nutritious within the diet in ways that can be fully enjoyed and flexible,” Castle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000k3b6nlzirsnbi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Try to prioritize sitting down as a family for meals and avoid labeling foods as “good” or “bad,” said Castle, author of “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kids-Thrive-Every-Size-Between/dp/152352183X" target="_blank"&gt;Kids Thrive at Every Size&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000l3b6nbgm4zqvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The clean plate club or rewarding with sweets — they might work in the moment, but they don’t do a good job of establishing the self-trust and an intuitive, good relationship with food as kids grow up,” Castle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000m3b6n5jerqgql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study didn’t just track rates in the United States. Instead, researchers analyzed data from 96 studies across 21 countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000n3b6nqooncpgr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another important consideration the study team made is how blood pressure differs in and outside the doctor’s office. Some children might have normal blood pressure at home, but a higher reading in the office, while others might have a lower blood pressure in the office than they normally would.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000o3b6ng9l747cf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By including data from both office visits and at-home blood pressure readings, the researchers were able to include hypertension rates that are “masked,” or wouldn’t be caught in a doctor’s visit, Zhang said. Masked hypertension was found to be the most common kind, according to the data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000p3b6n8hf6cjkc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is important because it means that many children with true hypertension could go undetected if we rely only on office blood pressure readings,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000q3b6nmhrf70r3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The result show that one reading may not be enough, and there may be a need for more scalable solutions for better monitoring and care of hypertension around the world, Song added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

People who brought them in will then pick up the cat, and safely return them to the same location they picked them up to prevent repopulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some stipulations such as, if the temperatures are under 30 degrees overnight from Wednesday into Thursday morning, the shelter will cancel the trap and release day and wait till the next month. This is due to keeping the cats safe from being in the traps during below freezing temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shelter has vaccinated and sterilized a total of 162 cats so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, visit: &lt;a href="https://www.salina-ks.gov/animal-services"&gt;https://www.salina-ks.gov/animal-services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Salina Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 22:47:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9iWXVaRUY3bHpTS3dUdkVJVFVfdDE0Z2lpVnRxbnNWQm9oS1N6S1NwVHdMakJiUG1Yc2VZMkM1VklWZ0lNd2NwVHExZUU4X2dHalZCaEoxVFotRzI2bnp4eFdhSXVSS29HQVdFV1RlOUxSS1U</guid></item><item><title>创新的治疗方法，技术可以改变糖尿病护理- WJAR</title><link>https://turnto10.com/features/health-landing-page/beyond-blood-sugar-future-care-type-1-2-diabetes-epidemic-world-health-organization-glp-1-receptor-agonists-hormone-pancreas-insulin-pumps</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;NASHVILLE, Tenn. (Ivanhoe Newswire)  — &lt;/span&gt;The number of adults living with diabetes worldwide has surpassed 800 million, and the World Health Organization calls Type 2 diabetes an epidemic. But new science is giving hope. With more than 300 clinical trials underway, experts say prevention, early detection, and innovative treatments could dramatically change the outlook for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Lindsey Kovaleski, Type 1 diabetes has been part of her life since she was 12 -- just a little older than her girls, Lila and Evie, are now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I remember now being thirsty all the time. I remember running to the bathroom all the time," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindsey has navigated three decades of evolving treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I started off with multiple daily injections," she told Ivanhoe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, diabetes research seems to be moving at lightning speed. There's a new class of medications called GLP-1 receptor agonists. They are drugs that mimic a natural hormone to regulate blood sugar and reduce appetite. The next generation, triple agonists, is already in trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm really optimistic that those two things will decrease the need for orthopedic intervention in diabetic patients and ultimately decrease the need for amputation," said Dr. Mark J. Berkowitz, an orthopedic surgeon and director of the Foot and Ankle Center at Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEALTH CHECK: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology is transforming care as well. Continuous glucose sensors now link to insulin pumps that predict blood sugar spikes and drops before they happen, adjusting insulin automatically, day and night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are devices where patients can have their glucose readings immediately without poking their fingers," Dr. Barbara Gisella Carranza Leon, an endocrinologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also testing cell-based therapies that regenerate the insulin-producing beta cells destroyed by diabetes, with early trials showing some patients live months without insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Imagine having a medicine before that you had to give yourself twice a day, once a day, and now once a week. I'm looking forward to what is going to happen in the next 10 years," said Carranza Leon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies are engineering islet cells that evade the immune system, making pancreas transplants possible without immune-suppressing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's not just medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study at Harvard shows that a Mediterranean-style diet combined with moderate exercise and professional weight-loss support lowered the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by 31% in older adults -- proof that lifestyle changes, along with these cutting-edge treatments, can help turn the tide of this global epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributors to this news report include Marsha Lewis, producer; Matt Goldschmidt, videographer; and Roque Correa, editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WJAR</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 22:34:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwJBVV95cUxQYlg5Q3ktUHBaS2xhWlBxTFEzYWFCRFllRzEyMVdrQWpQeU9kTU5Ec29ESFJiUzBtZFFYN2pqdVVnRDM1dmhjam5wRGE3dzE5QnpCYUJQY2lYeDhIX2MxNHB4U2VvRGE2cVBvWHIzMjc1N0ItUE1OWUl4VHZtekxmZF95VEpuRkZieHI0cnUtcnVoVGt0STQzeTV4ZEtqZ1A0RGYweU9pSEZhU3VVYzlzZVpFWWFTeUlSNEZaQ1daTzE0d2o3WW1XUkwtSWNVa1NFMWs2U1l5UmVUR05ZZktVejNhd096eFFqZGZkTW5xMHpDR2pYWWZwSUcxQm4wTmhmSDFQYVM0SVNMSHo4WlhOWFlUYWNnNkE</guid></item><item><title>马里科帕县确认在2个公共场所接触麻疹-马里科帕县（ .gov ）</title><link>https://www.maricopa.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=3515</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content fr-view"&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-pasted="true"&gt;The Maricopa County Department of Public Health (MCDPH) has confirmed that a visitor from outside the county has been confirmed with measles and may have exposed people at two public locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are working closely with partners at the city and state levels, as well as at venues where the exposures occurred, to ensure that people are aware and protected,” said Dr. Nick Staab, chief medical officer at MCDPH. “This is a good reminder that any of us can face an exposure, and being vaccinated is our best defense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly infectious virus that can linger in the air for up to two hours, and approximately 90% of unvaccinated individuals who are exposed to measles will become infected. It is preventable with two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, typically given during childhood. Adults need at least one dose of MMR vaccine given after the age of one. Individuals born before 1957 or who had measles as a child are considered immune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposures occurred at the following venues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Home2 Suites by Hilton Phoenix Downtown &lt;ul type="circle"&gt;&lt;li&gt;125 E Jackson St, Phoenix, AZ 85004&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;November 5th at 3:00 pm through November 6th at 1:00 pm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watch for symptoms through November 27&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Concert at Mortgage Matchup Center&lt;ul type="circle"&gt;&lt;li&gt;201 E Jefferson St, Phoenix, AZ 85004&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;November 5th, 6:00 pm through November 6 at 12:30 am&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watch for symptoms through November 27&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who may have been exposed should watch for symptoms, which appear typically seven to 12 days after exposure but may take up to 21 days. Symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever (101 F or higher)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, and blotchy. The rash begins after other symptoms, usually on the face at the hairline, and moves down the body. The rash may last five to six days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals who develop symptoms are encouraged to seek medical care and testing.&lt;/strong&gt; They should call the provider ahead to let them know about symptoms and potential exposure before going in.

&lt;p&gt;The NOVA food classification system has been causing unnecessary confusion about which foods are “ultraprocessed.” It was developed by the Center for Epidemiological Studies in Health and Nutrition, School of Public Health at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and it groups foods by their level of processing and recommends avoiding “ultraprocessed foods” like candy and soda. All breakfast cereal is lumped in the ultraprocessed category. This has prompted debate among nutrition experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:%20courtney.pelitera@rd.topnutritioncoaching.com" target="_blank"&gt;Courtney Pelitera&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietician (RD), thinks the NOVA scale is being misinterpreted. “Processing simply refers to all physical, biological and chemical methods used during the food manufacturing process, including the use of additives. This classification system was never meant to determine the ‘healthiness of food’ as has become popular on social media channels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to RD &lt;a href="https://oldwayspt.org/inside-oldways/staff/kelly-leblanc/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7970648" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Kelly Toups LeBlanc&lt;/a&gt;, the VP of Nutrition Programming at Oldways, not all ultra-processed foods are created equal. “Some ultra-processed foods, like whole grain breakfast cereals, contain important food groups recommended in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Other ultra-processed foods, like candy bars and soft drinks, do not.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She takes issue with the way the NOVA list categorizes foods, especially whole-grain cereals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, refined grains like all-purpose flour, degermed cornmeal, and white rice, which have been processed to have their healthful bran and germ removed, are somehow considered minimally processed, putting them in the same category as fresh broccoli — while packaged 100% whole grain breads and whole grain breakfast cereals are considered ultra-processed,” LeBlanc said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that whole grain cereals can be an important part of nutrition assistance programs, providing valuable nutrition to vulnerable populations. “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623724346?via%3Dihub=" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7970648" data-affiliate="true"&gt;In a 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; from the USDA, government scientists designed a nutritious seven-day, 2,000-calorie diet in which 91% of calories came from ultra-processed foods,” LeBlanc said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does an RD look for in a breakfast cereal? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                Patients who are infected with malaria and dengue virus receive treatment in an isolation ward at a hospital in Pakistan. Drugs known as artemisinins have been remarkably effective in helping malaria patients recover but there's concern that the malaria parasite is developing resistance. A new drug called GanLum seems to offer a promising alternative.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;At the turn of the millennium, a new class of drugs derived from ancient Chinese herbal medicine revolutionized malaria care. Artemisinin's, as they're called, are based on extracts from the sweet wormwood plant. They arrived just as the drugs used since the 1970s were becoming useless for many, as the parasite that causes malaria evolved resistance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The deaths we saw in the late 1990s, the early 2000s — like 2 million a year — that was a direct result of drug failure," says &lt;a href="https://www.mmv.org/about-us/our-team/george-jagoe" target="_blank"&gt;George Jagoe&lt;/a&gt;, executive vice president of access and product management at Medicines for Malaria Venture, a non-profit. "No one ever wants to be behind the 8-ball again."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Artemisinins have saved millions of lives since then and are now the foundation of malaria treatment worldwide. But there are &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/11/15/g-s1-34176/malaria-drug-resistance-children-artemisinin-africa" target="_blank"&gt;worrying signs&lt;/a&gt; that these drugs are following in the footsteps of their predecessors. To prevent history from repeating itself, new drugs that target the malaria parasite differently are required, says Jagoe.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I would call it being ready, having a fire extinguisher in the back that you're ready to use, but maybe not necessarily deploying, versus the house catches on fire and you've got nothing," says Jagoe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After more than two decades, researchers are on the cusp of having that fire extinguisher.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A new drug, called GanLum, was more than 97% effective at treating malaria in clinical trials carried out across 12 African countries, researchers reported Wednesday at the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in Toronto. That's as good, if not better, than the current standard of treatment. If approved by regulators, it could be a powerful new tool against a disease that kills roughly half a million people each year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a big deal," says &lt;a href="https://biology.nd.edu/people/kasturi-haldar/" target="_blank"&gt;Kasturi Haldar&lt;/a&gt;, a biologist at the University of Notre Dame who has studied malaria for decades and was not involved in this study. "It's also pretty timely."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That's because of artemisinin resistance. First discovered in southeast Asia in the late 2000s, it's recently spread to the continent hardest hit by malaria. "Partial artemisinin resistance has been spreading quite aggressively across many parts of Africa," says &lt;a href="https://microbiology.columbia.edu/faculty-david-fidock" target="_blank"&gt;David Fidock&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiologist at Columbia University who wasn't involved in the study. "We've been sounding the alarm that we must have new drugs to deploy, should resistance lead to treatment failure. [GanLum] will help stem that significantly."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;GanLum stands for ganaplacide/lumefantrine, a combination of two drugs, one new and one old (most antimalarial treatments are combinations of drugs, to target the parasite at different stages of infection). The new one, ganaplacide, was discovered by scientists at Novartis after screening over 2.3 million molecules&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for antimalarial properties. It seems to work by disrupting the malaria parasites' ability to live inside human red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the lab, the researchers showed it could kill all known forms of the parasite, including those with mutations linked to artemisinin resistance. It also attacks the stage of the parasite that's responsible for transmission. "That is very desirable for a drug to have," says Haldar, since it can prevent the spread, in addition to just treating the patient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In clinical trial settings, the drug performed well too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The research team enrolled over 16,000 adults and children over 2 years old with malaria across a dozen countries in Africa. Half took GanLum over the course of three days and half got the current artemisinin-based standard of care. The team found both drugs were about equally effective, with GanLum coming out slightly on top. Both drugs had similar levels of side effects, including nausea and diarrhea. But the GanLum group did experience more vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The drug still needs to clear additional regulatory hurdles before it gets to patients. The team thinks that'll take about a year and a half. Even if it's approved and rolled out, GanLum likely won't be fully replacing artemisinin-based treatments anytime soon, since arteminisin-based treatments still work in many areas. "But at this point, it looks good enough that it could be used where there's a lack of responsiveness to the current [artemisinin-based] drugs," says Haldar. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, that could prolong the lifespan of both drugs, and help countries avoid the kind of surge in deaths that's happened when resistance overwhelms existing tools.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that socioeconomic disparities—particularly those limiting access to omega-3–rich foods like fish and nuts—intensify ADHD-related behavioral and attention difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after accounting for income and education, omega-3 deficiency remained a significant predictor of symptom severity. The findings highlight nutrition as a critical, low-cost public health strategy for managing ADHD in developing and conflict-affected regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutritional Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Adolescents with low omega-3 intake showed higher ADHD symptom scores.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socioeconomic Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Financial and educational disparities influenced dietary quality and ADHD risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Health Value:&lt;/strong&gt; School nutrition programs may help reduce ADHD symptoms affordably.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;De Gruyter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms are influenced by socioeconomic factors in regions affected by conflict and resource limitations, a new study focusing on non-Western populations has found. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that lower omega-3 fatty acid intake is significantly associated with higher ADHD symptom scores in Palestinian adolescents, reflecting findings from other research conducted in Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113876"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/ADHD-omega-3-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/ADHD-omega-3-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/ADHD-omega-3-neurosceince-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/ADHD-omega-3-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/ADHD-omega-3-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/ADHD-omega-3-neurosceince-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/ADHD-omega-3-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/ADHD-omega-3-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows kids eating food, thinking about fish." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/ADHD-omega-3-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/ADHD-omega-3-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/ADHD-omega-3-neurosceince-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/ADHD-omega-3-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/ADHD-omega-3-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/ADHD-omega-3-neurosceince-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/11/ADHD-omega-3-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study also identified a key link between ADHD symptoms and socioeconomic disparities, which directly affected participants’ omega-3 intake. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD likely affects more than 5% of children and early adolescents worldwide. Over several decades, neurologists have identified a strong link between ADHD symptoms and deficits in omega-3, which is essential for brain growth and overall cognitive functioning. As omega-3 can’t be produced by the body, it must be obtained through a diet rich in foods such as fish, nuts and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most previous studies into the association between ADHD and omega-3 intake have focused on Western populations, with limited evidence from developing regions. They have also largely focused on younger children rather than early adolescents, whose dietary habits and behavioral patterns are still rapidly forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research, published in De Gruyter Brill’s &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Adolescent Medicine and Health&lt;/em&gt;, aims to address this gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Omar Almahmoud and colleagues at Birzeit University&lt;u&gt;, &lt;/u&gt;Ramallah, Palestine, conducted a survey of 211 early adolescents in Palestine, including 38 with ADHD. Participants’ omega-3 intake was assessed using a culturally-adapted Food Frequency Questionnaire, reflecting dietary patterns typical of Palestinian families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also gathered data on socioeconomic factors, including participants’ age, gender, parental education and employment, and family income. This approach enabled them to explore the association within a culturally distinct and nutritionally under-researched population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when these factors were taken into account, the survey’s results broadly reflected the findings of previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lower omega-3 fatty acid intake was significantly associated with higher ADHD symptom scores,” Almahmoud said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adolescents with insufficient omega-3 consumption exhibited more attention-related and behavioural difficulties compared to their peers with adequate intake.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also identified a key link between ADHD symptoms and socioeconomic disparities, which directly affected participants’ omega-3 intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results highlight the importance of balanced nutrition – particularly omega-3 fatty acids – in supporting cognitive and behavioural health during early adolescence,” Almahmoud said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the findings suggest that public health interventions to improve omega-3 intake could offer a low-cost strategy to mitigate ADHD symptoms in school-aged children, both in Palestine and in other developing, conflict-affected regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than relying solely on challenging or potentially controversial pharmacological treatments, such efforts could take the form of school-based nutrition programs, caregiver education and subsidies for omega-3–rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1762983159497"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How does omega-3 intake affect ADHD symptoms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Lower omega-3 intake was strongly linked to higher ADHD symptom scores, suggesting this essential nutrient supports cognitive and behavioral regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1762983161784"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What role do socioeconomic factors play?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Adolescents from lower-income or conflict-affected regions were more likely to have poor omega-3 intake, worsening ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1762983161674"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why is this study important for ADHD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: It’s one of the first to examine ADHD and nutrition in a non-Western, conflict-affected population, showing global relevance for diet-based mental health interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and ADHD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#83e1eaefeffaadf0e2f4fae6f1f0c3e7e6e4f1f6faf7e6f1e1f1eaefefade0ecee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Billy Sawyers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://degruyterbrill.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;De Gruyter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Billy Sawyers – De Gruyter&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ijamh-2025-0149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Association between omega-3 fatty acid intake and ADHD symptoms among early adolescents aged 10–12 years: a cross-sectional study in Palestine&lt;/a&gt;” by Omar Almahmoud et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Journal of Adolescent Medicine and Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Association between omega-3 fatty acid intake and ADHD symptoms among early adolescents aged 10–12 years: a cross-sectional study in Palestine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deficits in omega-3 fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been implicated in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These fatty acids are essential for neurodevelopment and cognitive functioning during childhood and early adolescence. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between ADHD symptoms and dietary omega-3 intake among Palestinian early adolescents aged 10–12 years, with particular attention to socioeconomic determinants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study was conducted with 211 participants (38 with ADHD, 173 without ADHD). Parents completed a culturally adapted Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) to estimate intake of omega-3–rich foods (e.g., fish, nuts, seeds). ADHD symptoms were assessed by subtype, and socioeconomic factors were recorded. Group differences were tested, and logistic regression evaluated associations between omega-3 intake and ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with ADHD reported significantly lower omega-3 intake (mean=0.60 ± 0.68) than their peers without ADHD (mean=0.89 ± 0.72; p&amp;lt;0.001). The hyperactive/impulsive subtype had the lowest intake (mean=0.42 ± 0.62). Logistic regression indicated that each unit increase in omega-3 intake was associated with a 45 % reduction in hyperactive/impulsive symptoms (OR=0.55, p=0.03). Adolescents’ age, gender, parental education, parental employment, and family income were significantly associated with children’s omega-3 intake (p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower dietary omega-3 intake is associated with more severe ADHD symptoms, particularly in the hyperactive/impulsive subtype. Socioeconomic disparities further exacerbate nutritional deficiencies, with potential consequences for neurodevelopment and behavioral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health interventions—such as school-based nutrition programs, caregiver education, and subsidies for omega-3–rich foods—may support mental health and cognitive development among children and early adolescents in resource-limited and conflict-affected settings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 21:40:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTE05WlJ2ZUI4MjNOYmpKQS1xY29Bak9PZkpfcUowX1Y5SHEydzdaM05FcHE4RFZaWm5Ec0lybkhCRHNnRmFNWnd0bXoxM0VCVF9JcWhCbUg1cnZPMHk5</guid></item><item><title>BMJ对受到严厉批评的干细胞论文表示担忧- Retraction Watch</title><link>https://retractionwatch.com/2025/11/12/bmj-places-expression-of-concern-on-heavily-criticized-stem-cell-paper/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/11/06/sleuths-flag-complete-mismatch-in-data-of-bmj-stem-cell-study/"&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt;, the October 29 paper included results of a phase III clinical trial in Shiraz, Iran. Critics quickly began pointing out discrepancies in the data on PubPeer, including psychologist Nick Brown, who pointed out a “curious repeating pattern of records in the dataset” every 101 records. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj-2024-083382"&gt;expression of concern&lt;/a&gt; published today, &lt;em&gt;The BMJ&lt;/em&gt; acknowledged issues “apparent from the data that support the paper” including data irregularities, discrepancies in the age criteria and the ages of participants included in the study, and undeclared conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-133319"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/24/improving-reproducibility-what-can-funders-do-guest-post-by-dorothy-bishop/"&gt;Dorothy Bishop&lt;/a&gt;, professor of developmental neuropsychology at Oxford University, was the first to point out issues with the paper, specifically that the study claimed to have enrolled only patients under 65 years of age. However, in the &lt;a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/_b_PREVENT-TAHA8_study_Dataset_Prevention_of_Acute_Myocardial_Infarction-Induced_Heart_Failure_by_Intracoronary_Infusion_of_Mesenchymal_Stem_Cells_A_Phase_III_Randomized_Clinical_Trial_b_/29375153/2?file=55664687"&gt;accompanying data&lt;/a&gt;, 127 of the patients were older than 65 — a “complete mismatch,” she told us. She also noted the authors made the data available to the journal and reviewers only after the paper had undergone &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj-2024-083382/peer-review"&gt;two rounds of peer review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On PubPeer, Bishop pointed out potential conflicts of interest, noting author &lt;a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/whri/people/academic-staff/items/mathuranthony.html"&gt;Anthony Mathur&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at Queen Mary University of London, is a &lt;a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/10282577/officers"&gt;shareholder&lt;/a&gt; and trustee of the Heart Cells Foundation, a charity that funds &lt;a href="https://www.heartcellsfoundation.com/compassionate-centre/"&gt;a unit &lt;/a&gt;for administering stem cell therapies to cardiac patients.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The editors judge that the trial may have breached accepted practices and that the results may not be reliable,” the notice states. &lt;em&gt;The BMJ&lt;/em&gt; plans to investigate fully, the notice continues, and will consider an “auditable replacement dataset” the authors provided to the journal. Most of the authors, including corresponding author &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/armin-attar-26ba11173/?originalSubdomain=ir"&gt;Armin Attar&lt;/a&gt;, are researchers at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After our article was published, sleuths &lt;a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C08779C45DB6E407DFAC85583BE9C4#1"&gt;continued to point out issues&lt;/a&gt; with the paper. &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=Gideon+Meyerowitz-Katz"&gt;Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz&lt;/a&gt;, a research fellow at the University of Wollongong in Australia, noted “oddities” in the data, including that nearly half of recorded heart rates were divisible by five. He also pointed out an “unexpected” pattern in patient’s temperatures — of 311 recorded temperatures, 42 were exactly 36.2 degrees Celsius. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Retractions in &lt;em&gt;The BMJ &lt;/em&gt;are rare. The journal issued its first retraction in 1989 and has retracted a &lt;a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?%3d1%26jou%3dBMJ%253a%2bBritish%2bMedical%2bJournal"&gt;total of just 12 articles&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Retraction Watch Database.&lt;/p&gt;

Skowronski was senior &lt;a href="https://utppublishing.com/doi/10.3138/jammi-2025-0025"&gt;&lt;u&gt;author of the paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was published in the&lt;em&gt; Journal of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We look to the US to see what is circulating, because it drives what's going on in North America," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H3N2 shows early dominance in UK, Japan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has not posted the standard weekly respiratory illness &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;surveillance data since September 26&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it is unknown when or if national surveillance in the country will resume.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skowronski and her colleagues said sequencing information gleaned from the Northern Hemisphere 2024-25 influenza season showed influenza A mutations among emerging Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere H3N2 variants relative to the 2024-25 subclade J and updated 2025-26 subclade J.2 vaccine reference strains, which were used to formulate the current vaccine. H3N2 and H1N1 are both influenza A strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This subclade K emerged at the tail end of Southern Hemisphere's season after the WHO [World Health Organization] made the choice of the strain, which is subclass J2," she said.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H1N1 predominated the flu season this year in the Southern Hemisphere, with the H3N2 subclade K taking off only at the end. But early data from the United Kingdom and Japan show that the H3N2 subclade K was represented in 90% of flu samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A drift, not a shift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's too early to tell what this will mean for the United States, but Skowronski said she and her colleagues do not believe this strain of H3N2 will lead to a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a major drift, not a shift," she said. "This is the same subtype we have had circulating in human population since 1968. But each season, the virus evolves to evade immunity, and some seasons it's relatively more successful than other seasons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also said she was encouraged, because the mutation sites would not affect how well antiviral drugs work, and the mutations are not associated with increased virulence or severity.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if vaccine efficacy is significantly reduced, more flu cases should be expected, and surveillance is crucial to determine how much protection flu vaccines are offering.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveillance needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joshua Petrie, PhD, MPH, associate research scientist at Wisconsin's Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Population Health, said he's not seeing a lot of influenza activity — yet. The flu he and his colleagues have seen is primarily H1N1, but he expects H3N2 will be the dominant strain this year.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said most states will collect surveillance data throughout the season, but there's uncertainty given the lack of national surveillance provided by the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The influenza season can take off quickly, and it might sneak up on us you if we you aren't watching what is happening nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The influenza season can take off quickly, and it might sneak up on us you if we you aren't watching what is happening nationally," he said. "CDC also performs the more advanced characterization of circulating influenza viruses in terms of their genetics and how they interact with our existing immunity. These data are used to select viruses that will be represented in next year's vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now the experts have to wait. Skowronski said it could be that influenza B dominates instead of H3N2, though that's unlikely. In general, said Petrie, H3N2-dominant seasons pack a bigger punch, with lower effectiveness of the vaccine and more severe illness in older adults than in H1N1-dominant years.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrie said getting the flu vaccine is still important, even if there is a significant mismatch. "Even in seasons when vaccine effectiveness is lower, the vaccine still provides some protection and is the best thing you can do to reduce your risk of severe illness," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK preprint shows encouraging signs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/691349457a0ccd6a3aad7fa9/_Flu_interimVE_2526_.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Today preprint data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the UK Health Security Agency on early influenza virus characterization and vaccine effectiveness (VE) suggest that the 2025-26 vaccine is currently 70% to 75% effective at preventing hospital attendance in children aged 2 to 17 years, and 30% to 40% effective in adults.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The observed early VE is similar to end of season VE estimates typically seen in adults in recent years in the UK, Europe, and Canada," the authors wrote. "Our results are encouraging, though it is important to note that these observations are from a period very soon after vaccination when there has been no waning in effectiveness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strong protection, especially among children, is encouraging after the UK authors described reduced reactivity of subclade K with post-infection ferret antisera, and described an early and sharp rise in UK flu cases.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nevertheless, vaccine effectiveness against hospital attendance and admission in the early season currently remains within a typical range at 70 to 75% in children and 30 to 40% in adults," the authors added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This trend appears to be driven primarily by a rise in spanking, though the research also points to a smaller but significant increase in hitting and choking. The findings were published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2025.2565660" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Journal of Sex Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific literature has explored the connection between viewing pornography with aggressive content and holding attitudes that support aggression. A body of research indicates that exposure to aggressive pornography is associated with a greater likelihood of sexually aggressive behaviors and attitudes. Despite these connections, there has been considerable debate and variation in findings regarding how much aggression is actually present in mainstream pornography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous analyses of pornographic content have produced varied results about how common aggression is, partly due to different definitions, time periods, and types of media being studied. Most of this research did not include data from the last decade, a period of significant change in online content. The researchers of the current study sought to provide a systematic, long-term analysis to understand if, and how, depictions of aggression within highly popular online pornographic videos have changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was teaching a class on deviance and came across claims about rates of aggression in sexuality that were either not empirically substantiated or relied on problematic analyses and definitions of aggression. So I decided to conduct my own research on it, particularly on the common claim that mainstream pornography is becoming ‘harder and harder,”‘” said study author Eran Shor, a professor at McGill University and author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.routledge.com/Aggression-in-Pornography-Myths-and-Realities/Shor-Seida/p/book/9780367540302" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Aggression in Pornography: Myths and Realities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “This research is part of the larger picture that I present in my book.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate these trends, the researchers analyzed a sample of 255 videos from Pornhub, one of the most visited websites globally. They selected videos from the “most viewed” category, sampling content uploaded between the years 2000 and 2024 to create a long-term perspective. Each video had received at least two million views. This strategy was chosen to focus on the content most likely to be seen by large audiences and to maintain a consistent type of video for comparison across the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team used two different operational measurements for aggression. The first, termed “visible aggression,” included a predefined list of physical acts like spanking, hitting, and choking, regardless of whether performers appeared to consent. The second definition, “nonconsensual aggression,” was applied only when performers showed clear verbal or nonverbal signs of resistance or distress that were ignored by their partners. Coders also noted the presence of specific aggressive acts, titles suggesting aggression, and verbal aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the entire 25-year sample, visible physical aggression was present in 43.9% of the videos. Spanking was by far the most frequent act, appearing in 39.2% of all videos, followed by hair pulling at 10.2%. In contrast, nonconsensual aggression was found to be quite uncommon, appearing in only 1.6% of the videos analyzed. Titles that suggested aggression were also relatively uncommon, appearing in about 10% of the sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s analysis of trends over time provides evidence of a notable shift in content. The rate of visible aggression nearly tripled, rising from approximately 20% in the videos sampled from the early 2000s to around 55-60% in videos from the last decade. This suggests that viewers of popular pornography today are substantially more likely to encounter scenes with physical aggression than they were 15 to 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous research that covered data up to the mid-2010s did not find a significant increase in most types of aggression,” Shor told PsyPost. “So the significant increase in this study that covered data up to the mid 2020s was not necessarily expected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers report that this increase can largely be attributed to a sharp rise in the depiction of spanking. This practice was seen in less than 20% of videos from the 2000s but appeared in more than half of the videos sampled from the late 2010s and early 2020s. The authors note that spanking is often considered a milder form of aggression and that its meaning can be subjective, with some viewers not perceiving it as aggressive at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While spanking accounted for most of the change, the study also identified a statistically significant increase in other forms of aggression that are often considered more severe. Depictions of hitting a partner’s body or face showed an increase, as did the practice of choking or applying pressure to the neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise in depictions of choking was particularly consistent. This practice was absent in the earliest videos sampled for the study but showed a steady climb over the years, appearing in 15% of the most popular videos from the 2020s. This finding aligns with anecdotal reports and scholarly concerns about the normalization of choking in sexual contexts. The study did not find significant changes over time for nonconsensual aggression, titles suggesting aggression, or verbal aggression, which all remained relatively low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there’s a rise in overall aggression over the years, most of it can be ascribed to an increase in relatively light forms of aggression, primarily spanking,” Shor said. “Still, I also found a significant (though smaller) increase in hitting and strangulation. The latter is particulalry concerning, as it might affect young people’s sexual script and normalize a practice that could be health-risking and even life- endangering.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers propose that a bidirectional relationship may exist, where pornography both reflects and shapes sexual interests. As choking becomes more visible in pornography, it may be perceived as a normal or expected part of a sexual script. This can influence viewers to believe the practice is safe and does not require explicit consent, potentially leading them to incorporate it into their own sexual activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledge certain limitations to their study. The sample size was relatively modest, and the analysis was confined to the “most viewed” videos on a single website, which may not represent all available pornographic content. Relying on the platform’s own viewership data also presents a potential constraint, as such figures could be manipulated for commercial reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For future research, the study suggests expanding analyses to include larger samples, other websites, and different genres of pornography.

            On Monday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced that after 20 years, they were righting a medical wrong — what Makary has called “maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine” — by pushing to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/hormone-therapy-menopause-fda-warning-wellness"&gt;remove the “black box” warning&lt;/a&gt; on hormone therapy for menopause symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00022e6fzxt827bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By dismissing the classwide boxed warning that flagged risks of heart disease, breast cancer and potentially dementia from estrogen-containing products, the FDA expects to open access to a therapy that Makary said was so impactful, it ranks near &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrMakaryFDA/status/1987891721922138128" target="_blank"&gt;antibiotics and vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwax2o6001v3b6qijj2zmmi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary blamed the broad&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;22-year-old warning on flawed, misrepresented research he said became dogma and “medical groupthink” that spread fear and dismissal of women’s menopausal “mood swings, night sweats, weight gain, hot flashes, divorce.” He hailed the “profound long-term health benefits that few people, even physicians, know about.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb4bqp00243b6qedceb4w6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “HRT has saved marriages, rescued women from depression, prevented children from going without a mother,” Makary said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb38i900213b6qqlif026a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, addressing an audience that included his wife and two daughters, described how prescription pills, creams, sprays, patches and injections that deliver estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progesterone could dramatically cut a woman’s risk of heart disease and dementia and even extend life an additional decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb5qa100263b6q2yyy3btd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Physicians who treat women applauded parts of the decision but said they worry that the benefits of hormones might be oversold based on outdated or cherry-picked data. Some said the removal of the black box warning from all forms of hormone therapy — particularly pills, which deliver estrogen to the entire body — isn’t scientifically justified and downplays evidence of real risks of longer-term use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb7jqz002g3b6q0pirwzho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They’re not miracle drugs, they say, and benefits and risks will vary from woman to woman.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwaw547001s3b6qr5vomf7g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I really worry about this overwhelming embrace of hormone replacement therapy without understanding the data,” said Dr. Leslie Cho, an interventional cardiologist and director of the Cleveland Clinic’s Women’s Cardiovascular Center. Cho was the lead author of a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061559" target="_blank"&gt;comprehensive research review&lt;/a&gt; published in 2023 that detailed the risks and benefits of hormone therapy for women of various ages and health histories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb6a1r002a3b6qp0axhpao@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cho and other experts say that what’s needed now is better balance. They are asking FDA officials and doctors to treat hormone therapy like any other drug that has both benefits and risks, and remember that hormones aren’t the only options for treating menopausal symptoms anymore.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00052e6fp0iuc4vq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After extolling the benefits of hormones, Makary emphasized that doctors and patients would decide what treatments to use and for how long. The government, he said, is not the doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwao5sc00153b6q3e5a5luf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We want people to talk to their doctors,” he said, “and we want doctors to have the right information, and part of that means removing these scary black box warnings and putting the nuanced discussion in the package insert of the medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000f2e6fjno14x4i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2002, a large government-funded randomized controlled trial called the Women’s Health Initiative was stopped early by an outside panel of experts who were monitoring the results in real time. The panel, called the data safety monitoring board, had determined that the risks of taking a combination of estrogen and progesterone outweighed the benefits to study participants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000i2e6fhdoflnc7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After analyzing the results of the study in detail, the FDA determined in 2003 that women should be informed of the risks of estrogen-containing therapies and ordered&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that those risks be prominently featured on the product labels as a boxed warning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000g2e6f1xhkau1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women stopped using hormones in droves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000h2e6fnr8b7qsh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Basically, we went from everybody wanting to put estrogen in the water to prevent heart disease, to then this black box label where you wouldn’t dare use it,” said Dr. Marcia Stefanick, a professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Researcher Center, who was one of the original investigators on the Women’s Health Initiative study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000j2e6f8xlrpmy3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And now we’re going back to ‘Let’s remove the black box label,’ so it feels like we really have come full circle.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000l2e6fx6y9gltc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Newer evidence suggests that hormones applied to the skin aren’t metabolized by the body the same way as bodywide estrogen therapies and thus may have lower risks. Women’s health advocates have argued for years that these blanket warnings have unfairly lumped estrogen applied to the skin and the lining of the vaginal canal with estrogen pills and injections that raise estrogen levels in the blood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000m2e6fthozsvys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary said this week that the FDA’s decision to ditch &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841321" target="_blank"&gt;most of the black box warning&lt;/a&gt; — it will still caution women who have a uterus not take estrogen alone, since that increases the risk of endometrial cancer — was based on an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fda-expert-panels/fda-expert-panel-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-women-07172025" target="_blank"&gt;expert panel&lt;/a&gt; discussion held earlier this year and the agency’s own “robust review of the latest scientific evidence.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000n2e6f6tr64aj5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary said that the FDA’s staff scientists enthusiastically recommended the move and that their evidence review would be published at a later date.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000o2e6frnwc5dd2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Tuesday, a person with direct knowledge of the FDA’s plans said Makary was referring to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841321" target="_blank"&gt;a Viewpoint article&lt;/a&gt; co-authored by Makary and three other FDA officials in the medical journal JAMA. (In the conflicts of interest section, the article notes that Makary receives royalties from sales of his 2024 book, “Blind Spots: When Medicine Gets It Wrong, and What It Means for Our Health,” which devotes a chapter to hormone therapy.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000p2e6fyaqmxqa9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The JAMA article was essentially that. The FDA conducted their comprehensive review,” said the person, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to share the information with the media.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000q2e6fmkm8hagb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the JAMA Viewpoint is not the detailed study of studies that researchers and regulators typically undertake when trying to assess the benefits and risks of a treatment. Instead, it is a position statement that cited selected studies to support its points.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000r2e6f1f9waqvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During Monday’s announcement, for example, Makary held up a study he said was “from the journal Cancer” in 2023 that “concluded that more than 40 observational studies show a consistent 30% to 50% reduction in coronary heart disease.” &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9178928/" target="_blank"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; Makary referenced was not from Cancer, a highly cited medical journal published by the American Cancer Society, but from a lesser-known publication called The Cancer Journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000s2e6fcvclu6f4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary also didn’t mention&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the sentence in that paper that said randomized controlled trials “have shown a null effect of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;[hormone replacement therapy] on [coronary heart disease] in analyses of women over all ages, typically 45–90 years old when randomized to HRT versus placebo” — meaning studies that have compared women taking estrogen-containing hormone therapies with those on a placebo have found no net benefit for heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000t2e6fym2eib53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other studies cited in an HHS fact sheet on the decision – including one to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of heart disease by 50% – come from research reviews that are decades old and don’t include more recent scientific findings. A citation to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of dementia by 65% comes from an older, relatively small Danish study of 343 women published in 2005.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000u2e6f0bcq9lvv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The type of evidence, as well as the breadth of evidence the FDA uses to make its regulatory decisions, matters, experts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000v2e6f7917bay7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Rebecca Thurston, the assistant dean of women’s health research at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, noted that the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning “was a deviation from the typical process.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000w2e6f5ejegtbx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the past, the agency has followed &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-requires-removal-some-prescribing-and-dispensing-restrictions" target="_blank"&gt;a very different protocol&lt;/a&gt; when considering the removal of black box warnings from drugs like the diabetes treatment&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Avandia, which had a warning removed in 2013. The agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-revises-description-mental-health-side-effects-stop-smoking" target="_blank"&gt;followed similar steps&lt;/a&gt;, including the review of new data and convening of an advisory committee, when it removed the boxed warning from the smoking cessation drug Chantix in 2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000y2e6fiegh68sb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Asked Monday why the FDA had not convened an advisory committee to review all the data on hormone therapy and make recommendations to the agency, Makary said it was because such committees are “are bureaucratic, long, often conflicted and very expensive, so we can have an active, robust discussion as a group of medical experts spontaneously.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000z2e6fhkt1g061@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In July, at the FDA’s panel on hormone therapy, many of the experts were there to champion the removal of the warning from a specific group of hormone products: vaginal estrogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwai2as00113b6ql198ibz1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Medical groups including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Menopause Society had advocated to remove the warning from those products for nearly a decade. The FDA had rejected a petition to remove the boxed warning from the vaginal estrogen products in 2018, citing a lack of evidence on their safety.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00132e6fwjgaevk3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaginal estrogens prevent thinning and drying of the tissues that line the vaginal walls, which can lead to painful sex and urinary tract infections. Estrogens inserted into the vagina stay in the tissues there and don’t seem to affect blood levels, said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00142e6fawrsrdhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The boxed warning for local vaginal estrogen was inappropriate. It was not evidence-based, and it was leading to many women not benefiting from a safe and effective medication for a common debilitating condition,” Manson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwcklm900003b6qjvc4kz51@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Four major medical societies that have established guidelines on the use of hormone therapy to relieve menopause symptoms — the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Menopause Society, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology and the Endocrine Society — told CNN that the FDA did not reach out to them before making the new decision to lift the boxed warning on estrogen-containing products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00162e6fyeytklhw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This week, some experts said they felt that the FDA was going too far in removing the warning from systemic therapies — such as pills or injections that don’t just stay in one area but travel around the body — especially in the absence of any new clinical trial evidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00172e6ff5ucoacl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “HHS and the FDA have claimed that the removal of the boxed warning for hormone replacement therapy will ‘restore gold-standard science to women’s health.’ In fact, the opposite is true. These treatments have well-documented cardiovascular, cognitive and cancer safety risks,” Nina Zeldes, a health researcher at Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, said in a statement Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00182e6fjts7bpiq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Zeldes pointed out that claims that hormones could lengthen life and prevent dementia and heart disease go beyond what these products are approved for: treating menopausal symptoms and prevention of bone loss in osteoporosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00192e6fj7td5js1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unsubstantiated claims by senior FDA officials about the effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for unapproved indications undermines public trust in the agency’s decision-making,” Zeldes said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001a2e6fdjbmwjyc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said the group was supportive of the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning since it would surely encourage more conversations between women and their doctors about using hormone therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001b2e6fhd00gztx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fleishman cautioned, though, that not all hormone therapy products carry the same risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001c2e6fnyvqu9oz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is important to distinguish that systemic estrogen products — such as oral estrogen and transdermal patches, gels, and sprays — have a different safety profile than low-dose vaginal estrogen. Like all medications, systemic estrogen products are not without risk, and their use should be based on an individualized conversation between patients and their clinicians,” he said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001e2e6fpe1tsdw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All things considered, experts say, there’s still not enough evidence that taking hormones long-term can prevent chronic diseases of aging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001f2e6fam6pwjqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most women who are post-menopausal can probably take hormone replacement therapy,” said the Cleveland Clinic’s Cho. “However, what we now know from many, many years of hormone replacement trials is that there are women in whom we should really have sort of careful discussion, risk-benefit analysis before starting hormone replacement therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001g2e6fp3veyrbu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If women have high blood pressure, they have high cholesterol, they are overweight, we should really pause before we start hormone replacement therapy and discuss the pros and cons.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001h2e6fz01skpsx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is good evidence that some types of hormone therapy reduce the risk for hip fracture, which many older adults struggle to recover from. The FDA approved hormone therapy for osteoporosis in 1988. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9632404/#:~:text=A%20population%2Dbased%20case%2Dcontrol%20study%20in%20Sweden%20found,gave%20similar%20risk%20estimates%20as%20oral%20regimens" target="_blank"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; estimated that each year of hormone therapy decreased the risk of hip fracture by about 6% per year of use, and data from the Framingham heart study found that the risk of hip fracture was reduced by 65% in current users of hormone therapy and about 30% in former users.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001i2e6f1a1k8xab@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But hormone therapy isn’t the only drug that treats bone health, so experts say women should weigh all their options with their doctors before making their decision.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001j2e6fqcpuwdv7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some worry that the FDA overshot the mark by removing the warning from all types of hormone therapies, especially pills, which expose the entire body to hormones and may increase a person’s risk for dangerous blood clots as much as fivefold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001k2e6fjejxsm2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would prefer a more nuanced change of the labeling if it was for systemic therapies,” said Dr. Cynthia Stuenkel, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California at San Diego.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001l2e6f10026pxb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that there are estrogen preparations, particularly oral ones, that the black box warning is still relevant for, and I think for the combinations of hormone therapy that were used in the [Women’s Health Initiative], I think those warnings are relevant. That’s where these data came from.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001m2e6fz52e5com@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Transdermal, or through-the-skin, estrogen creams, gels, patches and sprays don’t seem to be metabolized by the liver the same way pills are. As a result, there’s some evidence that transdermal forms of estrogen may not raise blood clot risk the same way pills do, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001n2e6fbovpi2gz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think if it was just the vaginal preparations, a lot of us have been saying for a long time that this would make sense,” Stuenkel said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001o2e6fs0p34u17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other experts are worried that doctors and patients will misread the FDA’s action as a green light to use hormones in all women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001p2e6f842zwmf7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Already, says Dr. Stephanie Faubion, a physician at the Mayo Clinic who is medical director of the Menopause Society, says she’s had patients well past the age of menopause come in and ask to take estrogen. One wanted to know whether she should take it for tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, and to improve markers of heart health like homocysteine and cholesterol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001q2e6f3ejr6eoh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a weird place to be in,” Faubion said. “With every patient, and I’m like, ‘All right, which side are we on?’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001r2e6f6fn8w2qw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Invariably, Faubion finds herself having one of two very different kinds of conversations with patients about hormone therapy: Either “it’s not an anti-aging drug. You shouldn’t take it for everything” or “it’s not going to kill you, really. I promise it’s a safe therapy, and you can use it for your hot flashes,” she said. “But it’s one or the other.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001s2e6f1j0fdssa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2840561?widget=personalizedcontent&amp;amp;previousarticle=201958" target="_blank"&gt;recent viewpoint&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, Thurston, at the University of Pittsburgh, said she hopes this time that women and their doctors won’t treat hormone therapy like a miracle drug, but with the same consideration they’d give any other medication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olx001t2e6fs0s9pwb0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It has risks, it has benefits, it has indications, it has contraindications, but it is neither a panacea nor poison,” Thurston said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olx001u2e6fhhmlnqvz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Every woman is different, and every woman’s needs during perimenopause and menopause will be unique. In recent years, the FDA has even approved two nonhormonal drugs that can help women manage their hot flashes, Veozah and Lynkuet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwbdg0v002u3b6qpt9r6gob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said patients and their doctors should carefully consider their choices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olx001v2e6fkkoacw7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And really, women deserve a range of different options,” Thurston said.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8hvq000x2cnja9mm34me@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Monday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced that after 20 years, they were righting a medical wrong — what Makary has called “maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine” — by pushing to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/hormone-therapy-menopause-fda-warning-wellness"&gt;remove the “black box” warning&lt;/a&gt; on hormone therapy for menopause symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00022e6fzxt827bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By dismissing the classwide boxed warning that flagged risks of heart disease, breast cancer and potentially dementia from estrogen-containing products, the FDA expects to open access to a therapy that Makary said was so impactful, it ranks near &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrMakaryFDA/status/1987891721922138128" target="_blank"&gt;antibiotics and vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwax2o6001v3b6qijj2zmmi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary blamed the broad&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;22-year-old warning on flawed, misrepresented research he said became dogma and “medical groupthink” that spread fear and dismissal of women’s menopausal “mood swings, night sweats, weight gain, hot flashes, divorce.” He hailed the “profound long-term health benefits that few people, even physicians, know about.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb4bqp00243b6qedceb4w6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “HRT has saved marriages, rescued women from depression, prevented children from going without a mother,” Makary said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb38i900213b6qqlif026a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, addressing an audience that included his wife and two daughters, described how prescription pills, creams, sprays, patches and injections that deliver estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progesterone could dramatically cut a woman’s risk of heart disease and dementia and even extend life an additional decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb5qa100263b6q2yyy3btd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Physicians who treat women applauded parts of the decision but said they worry that the benefits of hormones might be oversold based on outdated or cherry-picked data. Some said the removal of the black box warning from all forms of hormone therapy — particularly pills, which deliver estrogen to the entire body — isn’t scientifically justified and downplays evidence of real risks of longer-term use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb7jqz002g3b6q0pirwzho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They’re not miracle drugs, they say, and benefits and risks will vary from woman to woman.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwaw547001s3b6qr5vomf7g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I really worry about this overwhelming embrace of hormone replacement therapy without understanding the data,” said Dr. Leslie Cho, an interventional cardiologist and director of the Cleveland Clinic’s Women’s Cardiovascular Center. Cho was the lead author of a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061559" target="_blank"&gt;comprehensive research review&lt;/a&gt; published in 2023 that detailed the risks and benefits of hormone therapy for women of various ages and health histories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb6a1r002a3b6qp0axhpao@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cho and other experts say that what’s needed now is better balance. They are asking FDA officials and doctors to treat hormone therapy like any other drug that has both benefits and risks, and remember that hormones aren’t the only options for treating menopausal symptoms anymore.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00052e6fp0iuc4vq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After extolling the benefits of hormones, Makary emphasized that doctors and patients would decide what treatments to use and for how long. The government, he said, is not the doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwao5sc00153b6q3e5a5luf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We want people to talk to their doctors,” he said, “and we want doctors to have the right information, and part of that means removing these scary black box warnings and putting the nuanced discussion in the package insert of the medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000f2e6fjno14x4i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2002, a large government-funded randomized controlled trial called the Women’s Health Initiative was stopped early by an outside panel of experts who were monitoring the results in real time. The panel, called the data safety monitoring board, had determined that the risks of taking a combination of estrogen and progesterone outweighed the benefits to study participants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000i2e6fhdoflnc7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After analyzing the results of the study in detail, the FDA determined in 2003 that women should be informed of the risks of estrogen-containing therapies and ordered&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that those risks be prominently featured on the product labels as a boxed warning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000g2e6f1xhkau1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women stopped using hormones in droves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000h2e6fnr8b7qsh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Basically, we went from everybody wanting to put estrogen in the water to prevent heart disease, to then this black box label where you wouldn’t dare use it,” said Dr. Marcia Stefanick, a professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Researcher Center, who was one of the original investigators on the Women’s Health Initiative study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000j2e6f8xlrpmy3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And now we’re going back to ‘Let’s remove the black box label,’ so it feels like we really have come full circle.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000l2e6fx6y9gltc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Newer evidence suggests that hormones applied to the skin aren’t metabolized by the body the same way as bodywide estrogen therapies and thus may have lower risks. Women’s health advocates have argued for years that these blanket warnings have unfairly lumped estrogen applied to the skin and the lining of the vaginal canal with estrogen pills and injections that raise estrogen levels in the blood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000m2e6fthozsvys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary said this week that the FDA’s decision to ditch &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841321" target="_blank"&gt;most of the black box warning&lt;/a&gt; — it will still caution women who have a uterus not take estrogen alone, since that increases the risk of endometrial cancer — was based on an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fda-expert-panels/fda-expert-panel-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-women-07172025" target="_blank"&gt;expert panel&lt;/a&gt; discussion held earlier this year and the agency’s own “robust review of the latest scientific evidence.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000n2e6f6tr64aj5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary said that the FDA’s staff scientists enthusiastically recommended the move and that their evidence review would be published at a later date.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000o2e6frnwc5dd2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Tuesday, a person with direct knowledge of the FDA’s plans said Makary was referring to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841321" target="_blank"&gt;a Viewpoint article&lt;/a&gt; co-authored by Makary and three other FDA officials in the medical journal JAMA. (In the conflicts of interest section, the article notes that Makary receives royalties from sales of his 2024 book, “Blind Spots: When Medicine Gets It Wrong, and What It Means for Our Health,” which devotes a chapter to hormone therapy.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000p2e6fyaqmxqa9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The JAMA article was essentially that. The FDA conducted their comprehensive review,” said the person, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to share the information with the media.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000q2e6fmkm8hagb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the JAMA Viewpoint is not the detailed study of studies that researchers and regulators typically undertake when trying to assess the benefits and risks of a treatment. Instead, it is a position statement that cited selected studies to support its points.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000r2e6f1f9waqvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During Monday’s announcement, for example, Makary held up a study he said was “from the journal Cancer” in 2023 that “concluded that more than 40 observational studies show a consistent 30% to 50% reduction in coronary heart disease.” &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9178928/" target="_blank"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; Makary referenced was not from Cancer, a highly cited medical journal published by the American Cancer Society, but from a lesser-known publication called The Cancer Journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000s2e6fcvclu6f4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary also didn’t mention&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the sentence in that paper that said randomized controlled trials “have shown a null effect of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;[hormone replacement therapy] on [coronary heart disease] in analyses of women over all ages, typically 45–90 years old when randomized to HRT versus placebo” — meaning studies that have compared women taking estrogen-containing hormone therapies with those on a placebo have found no net benefit for heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000t2e6fym2eib53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other studies cited in an HHS fact sheet on the decision – including one to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of heart disease by 50% – come from research reviews that are decades old and don’t include more recent scientific findings. A citation to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of dementia by 65% comes from an older, relatively small Danish study of 343 women published in 2005.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000u2e6f0bcq9lvv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The type of evidence, as well as the breadth of evidence the FDA uses to make its regulatory decisions, matters, experts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000v2e6f7917bay7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Rebecca Thurston, the assistant dean of women’s health research at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, noted that the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning “was a deviation from the typical process.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000w2e6f5ejegtbx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the past, the agency has followed &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-requires-removal-some-prescribing-and-dispensing-restrictions" target="_blank"&gt;a very different protocol&lt;/a&gt; when considering the removal of black box warnings from drugs like the diabetes treatment&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Avandia, which had a warning removed in 2013. The agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-revises-description-mental-health-side-effects-stop-smoking" target="_blank"&gt;followed similar steps&lt;/a&gt;, including the review of new data and convening of an advisory committee, when it removed the boxed warning from the smoking cessation drug Chantix in 2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000y2e6fiegh68sb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Asked Monday why the FDA had not convened an advisory committee to review all the data on hormone therapy and make recommendations to the agency, Makary said it was because such committees are “are bureaucratic, long, often conflicted and very expensive, so we can have an active, robust discussion as a group of medical experts spontaneously.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000z2e6fhkt1g061@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In July, at the FDA’s panel on hormone therapy, many of the experts were there to champion the removal of the warning from a specific group of hormone products: vaginal estrogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwai2as00113b6ql198ibz1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Medical groups including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Menopause Society had advocated to remove the warning from those products for nearly a decade. The FDA had rejected a petition to remove the boxed warning from the vaginal estrogen products in 2018, citing a lack of evidence on their safety.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00132e6fwjgaevk3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaginal estrogens prevent thinning and drying of the tissues that line the vaginal walls, which can lead to painful sex and urinary tract infections. Estrogens inserted into the vagina stay in the tissues there and don’t seem to affect blood levels, said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00142e6fawrsrdhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The boxed warning for local vaginal estrogen was inappropriate. It was not evidence-based, and it was leading to many women not benefiting from a safe and effective medication for a common debilitating condition,” Manson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwcklm900003b6qjvc4kz51@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Four major medical societies that have established guidelines on the use of hormone therapy to relieve menopause symptoms — the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Menopause Society, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology and the Endocrine Society — told CNN that the FDA did not reach out to them before making the new decision to lift the boxed warning on estrogen-containing products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00162e6fyeytklhw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This week, some experts said they felt that the FDA was going too far in removing the warning from systemic therapies — such as pills or injections that don’t just stay in one area but travel around the body — especially in the absence of any new clinical trial evidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00172e6ff5ucoacl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “HHS and the FDA have claimed that the removal of the boxed warning for hormone replacement therapy will ‘restore gold-standard science to women’s health.’ In fact, the opposite is true. These treatments have well-documented cardiovascular, cognitive and cancer safety risks,” Nina Zeldes, a health researcher at Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, said in a statement Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00182e6fjts7bpiq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Zeldes pointed out that claims that hormones could lengthen life and prevent dementia and heart disease go beyond what these products are approved for: treating menopausal symptoms and prevention of bone loss in osteoporosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00192e6fj7td5js1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unsubstantiated claims by senior FDA officials about the effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for unapproved indications undermines public trust in the agency’s decision-making,” Zeldes said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001a2e6fdjbmwjyc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said the group was supportive of the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning since it would surely encourage more conversations between women and their doctors about using hormone therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001b2e6fhd00gztx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fleishman cautioned, though, that not all hormone therapy products carry the same risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001c2e6fnyvqu9oz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is important to distinguish that systemic estrogen products — such as oral estrogen and transdermal patches, gels, and sprays — have a different safety profile than low-dose vaginal estrogen. Like all medications, systemic estrogen products are not without risk, and their use should be based on an individualized conversation between patients and their clinicians,” he said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001e2e6fpe1tsdw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All things considered, experts say, there’s still not enough evidence that taking hormones long-term can prevent chronic diseases of aging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001f2e6fam6pwjqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most women who are post-menopausal can probably take hormone replacement therapy,” said the Cleveland Clinic’s Cho. “However, what we now know from many, many years of hormone replacement trials is that there are women in whom we should really have sort of careful discussion, risk-benefit analysis before starting hormone replacement therapy.

            “If women have high blood pressure, they have high cholesterol, they are overweight, we should really pause before we start hormone replacement therapy and discuss the pros and cons.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There is good evidence that some types of hormone therapy reduce the risk for hip fracture, which many older adults struggle to recover from. The FDA approved hormone therapy for osteoporosis in 1988. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9632404/#:~:text=A%20population%2Dbased%20case%2Dcontrol%20study%20in%20Sweden%20found,gave%20similar%20risk%20estimates%20as%20oral%20regimens" target="_blank"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; estimated that each year of hormone therapy decreased the risk of hip fracture by about 6% per year of use, and data from the Framingham heart study found that the risk of hip fracture was reduced by 65% in current users of hormone therapy and about 30% in former users.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001i2e6f1a1k8xab@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But hormone therapy isn’t the only drug that treats bone health, so experts say women should weigh all their options with their doctors before making their decision.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001j2e6fqcpuwdv7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some worry that the FDA overshot the mark by removing the warning from all types of hormone therapies, especially pills, which expose the entire body to hormones and may increase a person’s risk for dangerous blood clots as much as fivefold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001k2e6fjejxsm2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would prefer a more nuanced change of the labeling if it was for systemic therapies,” said Dr. Cynthia Stuenkel, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California at San Diego.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001l2e6f10026pxb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that there are estrogen preparations, particularly oral ones, that the black box warning is still relevant for, and I think for the combinations of hormone therapy that were used in the [Women’s Health Initiative], I think those warnings are relevant. That’s where these data came from.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001m2e6fz52e5com@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Transdermal, or through-the-skin, estrogen creams, gels, patches and sprays don’t seem to be metabolized by the liver the same way pills are. As a result, there’s some evidence that transdermal forms of estrogen may not raise blood clot risk the same way pills do, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001n2e6fbovpi2gz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think if it was just the vaginal preparations, a lot of us have been saying for a long time that this would make sense,” Stuenkel said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001o2e6fs0p34u17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other experts are worried that doctors and patients will misread the FDA’s action as a green light to use hormones in all women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001p2e6f842zwmf7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Already, says Dr. Stephanie Faubion, a physician at the Mayo Clinic who is medical director of the Menopause Society, says she’s had patients well past the age of menopause come in and ask to take estrogen. One wanted to know whether she should take it for tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, and to improve markers of heart health like homocysteine and cholesterol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001q2e6f3ejr6eoh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a weird place to be in,” Faubion said. “With every patient, and I’m like, ‘All right, which side are we on?’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001r2e6f6fn8w2qw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Invariably, Faubion finds herself having one of two very different kinds of conversations with patients about hormone therapy: Either “it’s not an anti-aging drug. You shouldn’t take it for everything” or “it’s not going to kill you, really. I promise it’s a safe therapy, and you can use it for your hot flashes,” she said. “But it’s one or the other.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001s2e6f1j0fdssa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2840561?widget=personalizedcontent&amp;amp;previousarticle=201958" target="_blank"&gt;recent viewpoint&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, Thurston, at the University of Pittsburgh, said she hopes this time that women and their doctors won’t treat hormone therapy like a miracle drug, but with the same consideration they’d give any other medication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olx001t2e6fs0s9pwb0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It has risks, it has benefits, it has indications, it has contraindications, but it is neither a panacea nor poison,” Thurston said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olx001u2e6fhhmlnqvz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Every woman is different, and every woman’s needs during perimenopause and menopause will be unique. In recent years, the FDA has even approved two nonhormonal drugs that can help women manage their hot flashes, Veozah and Lynkuet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwbdg0v002u3b6qpt9r6gob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said patients and their doctors should carefully consider their choices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olx001v2e6fkkoacw7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And really, women deserve a range of different options,” Thurston said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

It can be mild or life-threatening, and there is no cure for the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have known for years that the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/epstein-barr/about/index.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Epstein-Barr&lt;/a&gt; virus, an extremely common virus that mainly spreads through bodily fluids like saliva, appeared to be linked to lupus. About &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23469-epstein-barr-virus" data-link="native" class=""&gt;95% of adults&lt;/a&gt; have EBV, which is one of the most common causes of mononucleosis. Once you have EBV, it remains dormant in your system and rarely causes issues after the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. William Robinson, a professor of medicine and the chief of the division of immunology and rheumatology at Stanford University, as well as the lead author on the study, said that for decades, researchers have been unable to understand why just a fraction of people with EBV develop lupus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s been the enigma in the whole field,” he told SFGATE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md:pt16 md:sy16 md:bb md:bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class="vh y0 mb0 md:vv md:y100 md:mb16"&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="NTV7ARD" data-large-id="Inline-2" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To figure out why only some people with EBV get lupus, Robinson and his team along with researchers from multiple institutions — including the University of Massachusetts School of Medicine, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in Cincinnati and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center — homed in on EBV’s impact on a type of immune cell called B cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0 ruduv2y"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An electron micrograph showing three Epstein-Barr virus particles, which are colorized red-orange, in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BSIP/Universal Images Group/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24669-b-cells" data-link="native" class=""&gt;B cells&lt;/a&gt; are white blood cells that work by identifying &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24067-antigen" data-link="native" class=""&gt;antigens&lt;/a&gt;, the markers that signal the body when a foreign agent like a virus or bacteria has arrived. Once B cells identify the antigens, they release antibodies that fight off the invaders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can also act as a sort of billboard for other immune system cells, where they “display” the antigen that is being targeted, thereby helping the immune system identify the enemy. While some B cells can become autoreactive, meaning they target our own healthy tissues, these autoreactive cells tend to remain basically inert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My lab made a sequencing technology that enables us to pinpoint those [B cells] and thereby characterize them,” Robinson explained. “And we, to our surprise, discovered that EBV infects the B cells that cause autoimmunity and lupus.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team discovered that people with lupus had 1 in 400 B cells infected with EBV instead of the 1 in 10,000 rate found in people without the condition. And while the virus usually remains dormant, it can push autoreactive B cells to create a viral protein called &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/epstein-barr-virus-autoimmune-diseases" data-link="native" class=""&gt;EBNA2&lt;/a&gt;, which then can kick-start the immune system to start attacking healthy tissues.

Once B cells identify the antigens, they release antibodies that fight off the invaders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can also act as a sort of billboard for other immune system cells, where they “display” the antigen that is being targeted, thereby helping the immune system identify the enemy. While some B cells can become autoreactive, meaning they target our own healthy tissues, these autoreactive cells tend to remain basically inert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My lab made a sequencing technology that enables us to pinpoint those [B cells] and thereby characterize them,” Robinson explained. “And we, to our surprise, discovered that EBV infects the B cells that cause autoimmunity and lupus.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team discovered that people with lupus had 1 in 400 B cells infected with EBV instead of the 1 in 10,000 rate found in people without the condition. And while the virus usually remains dormant, it can push autoreactive B cells to create a viral protein called &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/epstein-barr-virus-autoimmune-diseases" data-link="native" class=""&gt;EBNA2&lt;/a&gt;, which then can kick-start the immune system to start attacking healthy tissues.

        &lt;p&gt;Oddly, about 20% of the B cells in our bodies are &lt;i&gt;autoreactive&lt;/i&gt;. They target antigens belonging to our own tissues — not by design, but due to the random way B-cell diversity comes about: through sloppy replication, apparently engineered by evolution to ensure diversification. Fortunately, these B cells are typically in a dopey state of inertia, and they pretty much leave our tissues alone.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;But at times, somnolent autoreactive B cells become activated, take aim at our own tissues and instigate one of the disorders collectively called autoimmunity. Some awakened autoreactive B cells crank out antibodies that bind to proteins and DNA inside the nuclei of our cells. Such activated “antinuclear antibodies” — the hallmark of lupus — trigger damage to tissues randomly distributed throughout the body, because virtually all our body’s cells have nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of EBV-infected people (most of us, that is) have no idea they’re still sheltering a virus and never get lupus. But essentially everyone with lupus is EBV-infected, studies have shown. An EBV-lupus connection has been long suspected but never nailed down until now.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;h3&gt;The antinuclear B cell gets ornery&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Although latent EBV is ubiquitous in the sense that almost everybody carries it, it resides in only a tiny fraction of any given person’s B cells. As a result, until the new study, it was virtually impossible for existing methods to identify infected B cells and distinguish them from uninfected ones. But Robinson and his colleagues developed an extremely high-precision sequencing system that enabled them to do this. They found that fewer than 1 in 10,000 of a typical EBV-infected but otherwise healthy individual’s B cells are hosting a dormant EBV viral genome.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Employing their new EBV-infected-B-cell-identifying technology along with bioinformatics and cell-culture experimentation, the researchers found out how such small numbers of infected cells can cause a powerful immune attack on one’s own tissues. In lupus patients, the fraction of EBV-infected B cells rises to about 1 in 400 — a 25-fold difference.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;It’s known that the latent EBV, despite its near-total inactivity, nonetheless occasionally nudges the B cell it’s been snoozing in to produce a single viral protein, EBNA2. The researchers showed that this protein acts as a molecular switch — in geneticists’ language a “transcription factor” — activating a battery of genes in the B cell’s genome that had previously been at rest. At least two of the human genes switched on by EBNA2 are recipes for proteins that are, themselves, transcription factors that turn on a variety of other pro-inflammatory human genes.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The net effect of all these genetic fireworks is that the B cell becomes highly inflammatory: It dons its “professional antigen-presenting cell” uniform and starts stimulating other immune cells (called helper T cells) that happen to share a predilection for targeting cell-nuclear components. These helper T cells enlist multitudes of other antinuclear B cells as well as antinuclear killer T cells, vicious attack dogs of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;When that militia bulks up, it doesn’t matter whether any of the newly recruited antinuclear B cells are EBV-infected or not. (The vast majority of them aren’t.) If there are enough of them, the result is a bout of lupus.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;h3&gt;What comes next?&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Robinson said he suspects that this cascade of EBV-generated self-targeting B-cell activation might extend beyond lupus to other autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease, where hints of EBV-initiated EBNA2 activity have been observed.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The million-dollar question: If about 95% of us are walking around with latent EBV in our B cells, why do some of us, but not all of us, get autoimmunity? Robinson speculates that perhaps only certain EBV strains spur the transformation of infected B cells into antigen-presenting “driver” cells that broadly activate huge numbers of antinuclear B cells.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Many companies are working on an EBV vaccine, and clinical trials of such a vaccine are underway. But that vaccine would have to be given soon after birth, Robinson noted, as such vaccines are unable to rid an already-infected person of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Stanford University’s Office of Technology Licensing has filed a provisional patent application on intellectual property associated with the study’s findings and technologies used to obtain them. Robinson, Younis and a third study co-author, Mahesh Pandit, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in immunology and rheumatology, are named inventors on the application. They are co-founders and stockholders of a company, EBVio Inc., a company exploring&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;an experimental lupus treatment, ultradeep B-cell depletion. This procedure involves total annihilation of all circulating B cells, which are replaced over the following few months by new, EBV-free B cells born continually in the bone marrow. Robinson is also a director of EBVio Inc. and a co-founder and shareholder of Flatiron Bio, LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Researchers from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cincinnati; the University of Massachusetts School of Medicine; the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center; and Rockefeller University contributed to the work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhw9o1wp004ap8ma3ntlohxl@published"&gt;My 5-year-old daughter, “Wren,” has been a nail-biter for the past six months. Nothing my husband and I tried could break her of the habit. Then miraculously, she stopped. When I mentioned my relief to my mother-in-law, she took credit for it. Then she told me her “solution.”&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not sure how to feel about this. On the one hand, I’m pissed my mother-in-law would lie to my daughter. On the other hand, it worked. Do I need to tell Wren the truth, or can my husband and I (at least for the time being) keep up the ruse?&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes, telling them the truth is cruel and heartless. (When my 5-year-old asked those questions, I said to him that most people live on this planet for 1,000 years before they go to cloud city in heaven to live forever, and that Santa and his sack of presents can take on a gaseous form and come up through the shower drains when there are no chimneys. I panicked!)&lt;/p&gt;

But if she asks about it directly—”Mom, I accidentally bit my nails in my sleep, but I don’t want my hair to fall out!”—well, please tell her the truth so she doesn’t grow paranoid about her hair loss and insist on wearing a wig.&lt;/p&gt;

As she munched happily on her chocolate cupcake after we sang “Happy Birthday,” my mother-in-law jokingly chided, “That’s gonna go straight to your hips, girl!” Several of the women present chuckled or pitched in affirmative comments. (Of course, no one has ever made a remark like this to my 3-year-old son, who also enjoyed a slab of cake before family at his birthday party recently.)&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, the 25-milligram oral version of Wegovy is awaiting regulatory approval, which could come by the end of the year. Notably, the drugmaker shared new data showing that the pill is both safe and effective. As a result, Dr. Jason Brett, Novo’s U.S. medical lead, said that the results give doctors and patients more information to help decide if this option is right for them, especially for people who don’t want to take injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Meet Your ETF AI Analyst&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data from the OASIS 4 trial showed that the pill improved blood sugar levels and supported heart health. For example, 71.1% of prediabetic patients returned to normal blood sugar levels after 64 weeks, compared to just 33.3% in the placebo group. Those who lost at least 15% of their body weight also saw improvements in blood pressure, inflammation, and triglyceride levels. This was similar to the results seen with injectable Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, the pill provided benefits to people across different groups, including women at all stages of menopause. Indeed, pre-menopausal women lost an average of 18.2% of their body weight, while peri- and post-menopausal women lost about 15%. It also helped people with low physical function feel better over time. More specifically, 77.3% reported noticeable improvement compared to 42.9% on placebo. It’s worth noting that the timing of this news is important for Novo, as it looks to strengthen its position in the obesity drug market &lt;a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/pfizer-clinches-10-billion-metsera-deal-as-novo-nordisk-loses-weight-loss-drug-battle"&gt;after losing a bidding war with Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-ticker="PFE" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pfe"&gt;(PFE)&lt;/a&gt; over Metsera &lt;a data-ticker="MTSR" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mtsr"&gt;(MTSR)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is NVO Stock a Good Buy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on NVO stock based on five Buys, three Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the &lt;a href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvo/forecast"&gt;average NVO price target&lt;/a&gt; of $60.16 per share implies 20.7% upside potential.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ethiopia’s Ministry of Health has confirmed an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in Jinka town, located in the South Ethiopia Regional State.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement issued Wednesday, the Ministry said eight suspected cases have been identified so far. Health authorities have deployed a rapid response team to the area to determine the cause, conduct laboratory testing, and prevent further spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Ministry, in collaboration with partners, is undertaking coordinated surveillance and response activities,” the statement said. “Community-level monitoring, contact tracing, and house-to-house case finding have been intensified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type of hemorrhagic fever has not yet been confirmed, and samples are being analyzed to identify the specific virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents have been advised to seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms such as unexplained bleeding, fever, diarrhea, or vomiting. The Ministry also urged the public to maintain strict hygiene practices, including regular handwashing and avoiding contact with individuals showing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health facilities across the region have been instructed to strengthen patient screening, isolate suspected cases, and promptly report any new infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further updates will be provided once laboratory results are available, the Ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We really do 'fall' asleep, a new study shows. Far from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-to-silence-your-thoughts-and-drift-off-to-sleep-an-expert-explains"&gt;gently drifting off&lt;/a&gt;, the brain rapidly transitions into sleep after passing a tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using brain scans taken from thousands of volunteers, researchers from Imperial College London (ICL) and the University of Surrey in the UK discovered a surprisingly sudden change in electrical activity around 4.5 minutes before the onset of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We discovered that falling asleep is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory"&gt;bifurcation&lt;/a&gt;, not a gradual process, with a clear tipping point that can be predicted in real time," &lt;a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/270894/falling-asleep-follows-brain-tipping-point/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; ICL neuroscientist Nir Grossman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-used-to-sleep-twice-every-night-heres-why-it-vanished"&gt;Humans Used to Sleep Twice Every Night. Here's Why It Vanished.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ability to track how individual brains fall asleep has profound implications for our understanding of the sleep process and for developing new treatments for people who struggle with falling asleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team's model converted 47 features of brain activity captured by an electroencephalogram (EEG) into an abstract mathematical space. This allowed them to record changes in the brain between bedtime and sleep, which, when mapped as a trajectory, resembles a ball rolling down a steepening slope towards a fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180977" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180977" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/sleep-feature-space-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-180977 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/sleep-feature-space-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/sleep-feature-space-1-600x234.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180977" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Graphical illustration of the computational framework, transforming one-dimensional EEG data (a) into a many-dimensional space (b) to calculate how close someone is to sleep when they nod off (c).

Permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a pilot study, published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2511778" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, a novel gene therapy was able to reduce patients’ low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol – 'bad' cholesterol – by almost 50 per cent, as well as triglycerides by an average of 55 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If future trials continue to be successful, then the single, one-off treatment could replace the daily cocktail of drugs millions take to control their cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDL cholesterol and triglycerides are fats that our livers naturally produce. If they build up in our blood, however, they can cause fatty deposits. These can lead to cardiovascular disease, which is responsible for 1 in 3 deaths in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Both LDL cholesterol and triglycerides are associated with major adverse cardiovascular outcomes such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/the-discoveries-bringing-an-end-to-heart-attacks"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;, stroke or death,” &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/steven-nissen/4268279" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Steven Nissen&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner School of Medicine, in the US, told &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nissen was part of a group that hoped to reduce people’s cholesterol levels by targeting the ANGPTL3 gene, which is associated with LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 1 in 250 people have a mutation that turns this gene off. As a result, these people have low levels of both blood fats. “Importantly, they also have a low incidence of cardiovascular disease,” said Nissen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, who gets the benefit of this mutation isn’t solely up to the genetic lottery anymore, thanks to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/crispr"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt;, the gene-editing technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using CRISPR, Nissen and his colleagues were able to tailor the therapy to switch off the ANGPTL3 gene in the liver. It was then administered, via an infusion, to 15 patients for an preliminary trial to test its safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within two weeks, the treatment substantially lowered the participants’ LDL and triglyceride levels. The study confirmed they remained low 60 days later, but according to Nissen, “These changes are expected to be permanent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors recommend keeping LDL cholesterol levels below 100mg/dL for optimal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/tags/the-heart"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; health. While diet and exercise can help, many people struggle to meet this goal, particularly those with a genetic predisposition to high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medications can help, but none of them lower both LDL cholesterol and triglycerides simultaneously. As a result, people often have to take multiple daily medications throughout their lives to manage their cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The next phase of the trial will begin within a few months and involve more patients with elevations in LDL cholesterol or triglycerides,” said Nissen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these continue to be successful, then the medication could offer a long-term weapon in the quest to defeat one of the world’s biggest killers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When we lose weight, we don’t just lose body fat – we lose muscle, too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be a problem for many reasons, because skeletal muscle is far more than the tissue that helps us move. It plays a crucial role in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/2046-2395-3-9"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;, regulating &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00033.2024"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/54.5.B207"&gt;healthy ageing&lt;/a&gt;. Losing muscle mass is linked to a reduced mobility, increased injury risk and is thought to potentially impair long-term weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With millions of people now using weight loss drugs such as Wegovy and Ozempic, understanding what impact this muscle loss &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.6586"&gt;might have on their health&lt;/a&gt; is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loss of muscle mass is also a significant challenge for athletes too, as many sports encourage them to keep body weight low while still maintaining demanding training loads and keeping their power-output high. So an energy deficit can put significant stress on an athlete’s body – but to what extent it affects their normal function, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40279-024-02108-y"&gt;is unclear&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet despite these widespread implications, we still know surprisingly little about how human muscle responds at the molecular level to the combination of calorie restriction and exercise. Understanding what happens to muscle when exercising in a calorie deficit is extremely important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202502384RR"&gt;Newly published research&lt;/a&gt; from myself and my colleagues casts light on this exact topic. We showed that weight loss accompanied by aerobic exercise might not be that bad for the muscles after all – and indeed it may have positive effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recruited ten healthy, fit young men who completed two tightly controlled five-day experimental trials in our laboratory. During their first trial period, they consumed enough calories to maintain their body weight. But during the second, we reduced their daily calorie intake by 78% – a severe energy deficit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During both trials, participants completed a tightly-controlled, 90-minute low- to moderate-intensity cycling exercise three times during each five-day period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the trials, we measured blood markers such as glucose, ketones, fatty acids and key hormones linked to energy preservation. We did this to determine if – and to what extent – the energy deficit was affecting them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also collected muscle biopsies before and after each testing period. Using an advanced method called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-9802-9_9"&gt;dynamic proteomic profiling&lt;/a&gt;, we analysed the production and abundance of hundreds of muscle proteins. This allowed us to build a detailed picture of how muscle adapts to sudden, substantial calorie restriction – even when exercise demands are maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the five days in an energy deficit, participants lost about 3kg. Hormones such as leptin, T3 and IGF-1 also dropped sharply – clear signs the body was getting into an energy preservation mode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But inside the muscle itself, something more unexpected was happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Muscle tissue changes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The muscle tissue mounted a strong and surprisingly positive response to the combination of exercise and calorie restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we saw an increase in the amount of mitochondrial proteins within the muscle – and these proteins were also being created more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are the power generators inside cells. They convert fat and carbohydrates into usable energy. Higher amounts of mitochondrial proteins, and faster production of them, are hallmarks of a healthier and more efficient muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The positive changes we saw within the muscle tissue correlated with a more youthful muscle profile.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/mans-grip-on-his-painful-elbow-2327824925"&gt;BigBlueStudio/ Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also saw a clear decrease in the amount and production of collagen and collagen-related proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collagen is an abundant protein that plays a role in providing structure and strength to the muscle. However, collagen tends to accumulate in excess as we age – contributing to stiffness and impaired function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these changes resemble a shift toward a more metabolically youthful muscle profile. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of response has also been seen in long-term calorie-restriction &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2019.12.002"&gt;studies in monkeys&lt;/a&gt;. But this is the first time it has been demonstrated in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Healthier ageing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it seems paradoxical that the body would invest energy in maintaining or improving muscle during a time of scarcity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muscle tissue is demanding and costly to maintain – and movement is energetically expensive, too. Shouldn’t the body simply reduce muscle activity to save energy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question may lie in our evolutionary past. Humans evolved as hunter-gatherers, who often faced periods of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30573-1"&gt;low food availability&lt;/a&gt;. During those times, the ability to move efficiently – to walk and run long distances, forage or hunt – was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-024-01876-x"&gt;essential for survival&lt;/a&gt;. A body that shut down muscle function during hunger would have been less likely to survive and reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the protective response we observed may reflect deep evolutionary adaptations: muscles stay ready to move even when fuel is running low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our study involved a small number of young men who were deliberately following an extreme energy deficit for a short period of time. As such, we cannot assume identical responses in women, older adults or people who are obese or have chronic health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future studies will need to compare weight loss with and without exercise, examine less extreme calorie deficits, include women and older adults, and measure how these molecular changes translate into actual physical performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, our findings support the idea that exercise during weight loss may protect muscle quality – and may even enhance characteristics linked to healthier ageing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings also have key implications for many people. People who are taking weight loss drugs or trying to lose weight may benefit from structured exercise to help them preserve muscle quality. Older adults, who are more vulnerable to muscle loss, may especially benefit from exercising while losing weight. Athletes may approach any energy deficit with care, but know that muscle keeps adapting to exercise stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our study shows that human muscle is remarkably resilient. Even under severe stress, when much of the body is trying to conserve energy, muscle tissue seems to respond robustly – boosting its energy-producing machinery and limiting age-related degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, losing weight and exercising doesn’t just help preserve muscle – it may help keep it younger.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

        

        
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Conversation</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 17:28:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOLUdPb1BwNUppMElXTUdGSm45UVdWaVBldXltdENXRkcwOVZRRXlrSkRJMEJMVEZ0TS1GU3FONFB4dEpnWG5sVkJ2RlFiSHl1Mk1yMWRtRU5NT0R1Y2ZTMXJld3lIdEhDM2ZJRHdqbkdRNnRoWlJJNEtGY2Rpa3RIV0F1dk5yRV9vUkFLcWlyWlVmdS1IaTMzYW8xaVRLeU5aTU1BN2lKbnFKcWJBVDB1VHE0MkF0OW1xQmc</guid></item><item><title>可能有助于延长寿命和减缓衰老的五种生活方式改变-对话</title><link>https://theconversation.com/five-lifestyle-changes-that-might-help-you-live-longer-and-slow-down-ageing-268326</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Society is fascinated with health, fitness and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/longevity-20168"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt;. This obsession has spawned a multi-million pound industry centred around pushing the latest cutting-edge science, lifestyle modifications and products that claim to prevent ageing and live as long as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the secret to a long life doesn’t have to be so complicated. There are many simple things everyone can do to slow down time and feel younger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about age, we aren’t always talking about how many candles are on your birthday cake. We actually have two different ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is of course chronological age. This is the number of years you’ve been alive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we also have a “&lt;a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/abc/a/mJmKp8SPc4fcQWNQ7HhyMKf/?lang=en"&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt;.” This is sometimes referred to as “true age” or “internal body age.” This refers to how well all of the body’s internal systems are functioning by looking for signs of ageing in the cells, blood and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.101020"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research indicates that a person’s biological age, rather than their chronological age, is related to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article-pdf/76/7/1295/38620245/glab069.pdf"&gt;how long they live&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s say you looked at two 60-year-old people. The person whose biological age is younger would be more likely to outlive the person who had a higher biological age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are now many ways to measure your biological age with &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8856/5/2/28"&gt;epigenetic testing&lt;/a&gt;, which only requires a little bit of spit and can be done at home. The saliva sample is then processed in a lab where the &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15592294.2018.1461295"&gt;DNA is extracted&lt;/a&gt; to get information about what’s happening in the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The everyday lifestyle choices we make affects our biological age. While some of the decisions we make can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.18611"&gt;increase it&lt;/a&gt; (such as drinking, smoking or being inactive), other factors can actually turn back the clock. Thus, how long we live may truly be in our hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are five evidence-backed ways of reducing your biological age:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Run away from ageing – literally&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being more physically active and regularly exercising throughout life reduces risk of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.07.236"&gt;death from all causes&lt;/a&gt; – directly increasing longevity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also never too late to get started. One study found that sedentary people who adopted an eight-week exercise programme (60 minute workouts done three times a week) &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02701367.2023.2228388"&gt;reversed their biological age&lt;/a&gt; by around two years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mixture of strength and endurance exercises done three to four times a week (with sessions as short as 23 minutes) is also shown to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.13841"&gt;significantly reduce ageing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise influences something called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.101020"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt;, a process which controls whether certain genes are “on” or “off.” As we age it’s natural that our genes start switching off – this is why we get winkles and grey hair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But exercise helps to slow these processes down, meaning the genes that help do important functions in the body continue doing their job for longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. You are what you eat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15112431"&gt;healthier food choices&lt;/a&gt; directly reduces biological age. This effect is even greater in those with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/about/index.html"&gt;chronic disease&lt;/a&gt; and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One study, which looked at nearly 2,700 women, found that adopting healthier eating patterns for 6-12 months was a key factor in staying &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqab307"&gt;younger for longer&lt;/a&gt;. This diet was also shown to slow ageing by an average of 2.4 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Healthier foods choices may lower your biological age by years.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/salmon-superfood-salad-grilled-fish-kale-2390870025"&gt;Sea Wave/ Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-00841-x"&gt;Healthier food choices&lt;/a&gt; included eating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, fish, lean proteins and healthy fats (such as oil) and reducing intake of red meat, saturated fat, added sugars and sodium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-balanced diet provides antioxidants, vitamins and anti-inflammatory compounds that help cells repair damage and reduce stress on our DNA. These nutrients also influence DNA methylation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Improve sleep habits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep is one of the strongest predictors of healthy ageing because it affects nearly every bodily system. Good quality sleep allows the body to repair DNA, restore hormonal balance, reduce inflammation and clear &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1134/S2079057025600053"&gt;cellular waste&lt;/a&gt; – helping the immune, metabolic and nervous systems stay youthful and resilient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One review showed that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coemr.2021.03.021"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt; is directly associated with how fast we age. People who sleep less than five hours per night have a significantly increased risk of age-related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a large UK study of nearly 200,000 participants found that those on shift work – and particularly night shifts – had a biological age &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-025-01575-z"&gt;around one year higher&lt;/a&gt; than their counterparts who worked at normal hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Avoid unhealthy vices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habits such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13148-023-01577-8"&gt;vaping&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-025-01485-x"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.205153"&gt;drinking alcohol&lt;/a&gt; are the strongest and most consistent accelerators of ageing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smoking, for instance, is shown to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13148-019-0777-z"&gt;rapidly age&lt;/a&gt; the lungs by up to 4.3 years and the airway cells by nearly five years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a study looking at 8,046 adults aged 30–79 years old found that consuming any amount of alcohol was associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16501"&gt;accelerated biological ageing&lt;/a&gt;. The more alcohol consumed the more age is accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These habits speed up biological ageing because they directly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15376516.2018.1528650"&gt;damage DNA&lt;/a&gt;, increase inflammation and overload cells with stress. This causes the body and organs to work harder – ageing them quicker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Master your mind&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress management is key. Research shows that being able to regulate emotions and manage stress levels &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-021-01735-7"&gt;predicts age acceleration&lt;/a&gt;. Another study found that working more than 40 hours a week on average &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.203872"&gt;increased biological age by two years&lt;/a&gt;, probably due to the stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress can directly accelerate biological age due to the way it affects hormonal response, damages DNA and reduces immunity. Stress can also indirectly affect other factors that may accelerate age, such as diet, sleep and whether we drink or smoke. This is why having a set of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559031/"&gt;positive coping mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; to manage stress is so important.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-025-01597-7"&gt;growing body of research&lt;/a&gt; is also showing that factors such as loneliness, exposure to extreme heat and cold, air pollution and our environment (such as living in deprived areas) can all also affect how we age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the affect of these factors on age may vary depending on the person, their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3295054/"&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt;, how long they’ve stuck with these lifestyle habits and other factors at play. &lt;/p&gt;

In accordance with Danish legislation, the above-mentioned ethics committee waived the need for specific informed consent in biomedical research based on existing biobanks. iPSYCH was approved by the ethics committee in 2012, with subsequent amendments in 2013, 2015 and 2018. More details can be found at &lt;a href="https://ipsych.dk/en/data-security/health-research-and-ethical-approval"&gt;https://ipsych.dk/en/data-security/health-research-and-ethical-approval&lt;/a&gt;. New Danish legislation (effective from January 2024) introduces the possibility for participants to opt out of studies that are exempt from active informed consent. After consulting with the Ethics Committees and patient organizations, iPSYCH contacted all participants (around 140,000) in the iPSYCH cohort in June 2025 and offered the possibility of opting out of new genetic studies initiated henceforth. Overall, 1.8% of the iPSYCH participants chose to opt out, and their data will be deleted from the active research database. Data included in finalized and ongoing studies will not be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical data were approved by the ethics committee at the University of Würzburg in Germany. In the Netherlands, they were approved by the regional ethics committee (Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek: CMO Regio Arnhem—Nijmegen; protocol III.04.0403 and 2014/290; ABR: NL47721.091.14) and the Institutional Review Board of the Radboud University Medical Center. Participants were included at the Department of Psychiatry at the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre.

None of the individuals was diagnosed with ID. They were recruited as part of the International Multicenter Persistent ADHD Collaboration (IMpACT) at two sites: Radboud University Medical Center, the Netherlands, and University Hospital Würzburg, Germany. In analyses of these clinical samples, we used control samples from individuals recruited together with the clinical cases at the IMpACT site at Radboud University Medical Center (ADHD-screened controls), and from 1,766 German control individuals who were recruited from the German MI Family Study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 52" title="Broeckel, U. et al.

To recap, the sequencing of 34,544 individuals from the iPSYCH cohort was performed using the Illumina Nextera Capture kit and the Illumina HiSeq sequencer. The sequencing process was performed in waves, including a pilot wave and three more substantial production waves. After sequencing, raw data were processed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) v.3.4 to generate a variant call format (VCF) v.4.1 file.

Next, we did thorough, multiple-round quality checks on the samples and the genetic variations using Hail 0.1. Samples were removed if they lacked complete phenotype information; if the imputed sex was inconsistent with the reported sex in the registries; if duplicates or genetic outliers were identified by principal component analysis (PCA); if they had an estimated level of contamination greater than 5%; or if they had an estimated level of chimeric reads higher than 5%. In addition, one of each pair of related samples was removed if the pairwise pi-hat value was 0.2 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genotypes were removed if they did not pass GATK variant quality score recalibration (VQSR) or had a read depth lower than 10 or higher than 1,000. QC was done in Hail 0.1. Homozygous alleles were removed if they had reference calls with a genotype quality lower than 25, homozygous alternate alleles with PL(HomRef) (that is, the phred-scaled likelihood of being homozygous reference) &amp;lt; 25 or less than 90% of reads supporting the alternate allele. Heterozygous alleles were removed if they had PL(HomRef) &amp;lt; 25 or less than 25% of reads supporting the alternate allele, less than 90% informative reads (that is, number of reads supporting the reference allele plus number of reads supporting the alternate allele &amp;lt; 90% of the read depth) or a probability of the allele balance (calculated from a binomial distribution centred on 0.5) less than 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;. After these filters were applied, variants with a call rate lower than 90% were removed, then samples with a call rate lower than 95%, and then variants with a call rate lower than 95% were removed. After QC, 28,448 individuals and 1,362,971 variants remained for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, we selected for this study the individuals diagnosed with ADHD and controls as described above, resulting in 8,895 cases and 9,001 controls (see Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM3"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt; for sample of individuals with other ancestries not included in this study). Finally, we defined rare variants (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 565,053) as those with an allele count no higher than five across our dataset (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 17,896) and the exome subset of gnomAD used in this study (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 44,779).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec21"&gt;Clinical samples&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biological samples collected at the Dutch and German IMpACT sites were sequenced at BGI, Shenzhen, China. The coding regions of the DNA were targeted using BGI´s exome-capture kit (developed by Beijing Genomics Institute targeting 58.8 Mb) and paired-end sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, with an average sequencing depth of 50×. The exome-sequencing data obtained from dbGaP were generated at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT using Illumina’s ICE Capture reagent kit, and sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 or 2500. Bam files for all samples (clinical cases and dbGaP controls) were reprocessed together, adhering to the same QC approach described above for the iPSYCH samples. After this QC process, 2,816 samples, consisting of 1,078 individuals with ADHD and 1,738 controls, remained for further analysis. We were not able to obtain a group of completely homogenous individuals after the exclusion of genetic outliers based on PCA (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM1"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;), and thus, to minimize the effect of population stratification in subsequent analyses, we aimed at getting as close to de novo mutations as possible; we therefore included only ultra-rare variants, defined as singletons not in the non-psychiatric subsample of individuals in the ExAC&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Lek, M. et al.

To avoid biases caused by variations in call rates between cases (entirely iPSYCH) and controls (83.3% gnomAD), all autosomal genes with higher rates of rare synonymous variants in cases than controls were excluded (15,603 out of 18,866 autosomal genes remained; 3,263 excluded).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variants were grouped depending on their impact on ADHD: class I variants include rPTVs and rare missense variants with MPC &amp;gt; 3 (rSevereDMVs); class II variants include missense variants with 2 ≤ MPC ≤ 3 (rModerateDMVs). Gene-based burden analysis was performed with a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. Only genes with an increased load of class I (3,698 genes) and/or class II (1,026 genes) variants in cases compared with controls were considered. We did not consider genes with higher numbers of class I and II variants in controls, because such observations could be caused by a generally higher number of variants in controls, owing to the previous filtering step in which only genes with a higher number of rare synonymous variants in controls than in cases were retained. A small number of genes (347) had an increased load of both class I and class II variants in cases, and for these genes we also estimated the combined impact of class I and class II variants in a meta-analysis using the weighted &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-score method. Weights were the ratio of the standardized effect sizes observed for the classes in enrichment analysis of constrained genes. For the 347 genes, we used the minimum &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value across the three analyses done for these genes. In total, we tested 15,603 genes (347 genes were tested three times) resulting in 16,297 tests. We considered a gene significantly associated with ADHD if the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value was lower than 0.05/16,297 = 3.07 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As described above, genes with an increased rate of rare synonymous variants in individuals with ADHD relative to controls were excluded to avoid biases when combining iPSYCH and gnomAD data. When inspecting the QQ-plot of rare synonymous variants (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM1"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;), the plot revealed the anticipated pattern of inflation that corresponds to our gene selection strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the clinical sample, we performed a gene-based burden test of class I variants using emmaxCMC&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 57" title="Li, B. &amp;amp; Leal, S.

This method allows for the incorporation of a kinship matrix to account for potential remaining population stratification among individuals. We generated the kinship matrix using ‘epacts make-kin --min-maf 0.01 --remove-complex’. In addition, we included sex, the number of ultra-rare synonymous variants, the number of all variants and PC1–PC10 from PCA (performed after excluding non-European samples) as covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Gene-set analyses in the clinical sample&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested for increased load of ultra-rare class I and class II variants in ADHD compared with controls in the clinical sample. We used different &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-value thresholds from the gene-based burden test in iPSYCH + gnomAD samples to define three ADHD rare-variant risk gene sets: &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; (20 genes), &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; (316 genes) and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (583 genes) (gene sets are listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM3"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;). The control group included 870 with cardiovascular disease and 896 without, so we also tested for the potential difference in ultra-rare class I variants across the two groups in the three ADHD gene sets. Only class I variants were tested, because these were the only type of variants with a tendency to be overrepresented in clinical ADHD cases versus controls (&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM1"&gt;Supplementary Information&lt;/a&gt;, Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM1"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM3"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;). The gene sets were tested using logistic regression with sex, number of ultra-rare synonymous variants, number of all variants, and PC1–PC10 from PCA (performed after excluding non-European samples) as covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;X-chromosome analyses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the distinct regions of the X chromosome, we applied region-specific thresholds to define rare variants: in the pseudoautosomal regions (PARs), rare variants were defined as those with an allele count of five or less following what was done for the autosomes. In non-pseudoautosomal regions (nonPARs), the rare-variant threshold was adjusted to an allele count of three of less to account for the hemizygosity in male individuals. This adjustment was derived using a scaling factor based on the relative contributions of male individuals and female individuals in iPSYCH (6,002 female and 11,894 male individuals) and subset of gnomAD used in this study (19,916 female and 24,863 male individuals):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ1" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$5\times \frac{({{\rm{n}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{m}}}_{{\rm{m}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{s}}}+2\times {{\rm{n}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{m}}}_{{\rm{f}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{m}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{s}}})}{2\times ({{\rm{n}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{m}}}_{{\rm{m}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{s}}}+{{\rm{n}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{m}}}_{{\rm{f}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{m}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{s}}})}=3.53$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variants were categorized into class I, class II and synonymous variants, using the same criteria applied for autosomal variants. In the burden test of male individuals, the number of alleles for nonPAR variants was counted as two to account for hemizygosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logistic regression was performed on three gene sets stratified by their pLI score, comparing the following groups of individuals: ADHD versus controls; ADHD without ID versus controls; ADHD with ID versus controls; and ADHD with ID versus ADHD without ID. Covariates included birth year, sex, the first ten PCs from PCA (non-European samples excluded), total variant count, rare synonymous variant count, exome target coverage (percentage ≥ 20×), mean read depth at target sites and sequencing batch (one-hot encoded). In addition, sex-stratified analyses were performed using the same approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For gene discovery on the X chromosome, we applied the same approach as for autosomes when combining iPSYCH data with gnomAD. We excluded genes with higher numbers of synonymous variants in individuals with ADHD than in controls and retained genes with a higher rate of class I variants in cases than in controls (78 genes included) or a higher number of class II variants (44 genes). We performed gene-based burden analysis separately for male individuals and female individuals, in which we, for each gene, compared the number of individuals with ADHD carrying at least one class I or class II variant to the number found for control individuals, using a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. Notably, six genes had both increased class I and II variants in cases compared with controls; for these genes, a meta-analysis was used to combine the effect of class I and class II variants using the weighted &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-score method. The weight was determined as the ratio of the standardized effect sizes observed for class I and class II variants in the enrichment analysis of constrained genes on chromosome X (weight = 1.03/1.86 = 0.55). In total, we performed 78 × 3 tests for class I variants (female, male and combined), 44 × 3 tests for class II variants and 6 tests for combining class I and II, resulting in a total of 372 tests. The Bonferroni correction threshold for statistical significance was set at &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 1.34 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;Rare burden heritability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used BHR&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 26" title="Weiner, D.

We used BHR to estimate the heritability of ADHD explained by the load of rare class I, class II and synonymous variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variant-level summary statistics associated with ADHD, including allele count and allele frequency from the iPSYCH exome data, were used as input for BHR. The method regresses gene burden test statistics (based on the variant category being evaluated) against burden scores that correspond to the combined allele frequency. The slope of the regression represents the burden heritability and confounding factors such as population stratification, are controlled through the intercept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec27"&gt;PPI-network analyses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ANK2 PPI networks were derived from published IP–MS datasets included in Table S2 of a previous study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 27" title="Pintacuda, G. et al.

To generate UMAPs for these data, we did the following, using Python and the single-cell analysis libraries Scanpy and AnnData: for each of the four scRNA-seq datasets, the raw counts were filtered to contain genes represented in a minimum of 30 cells. Afterwards, the raw counts were normalized and log-transformed, and highly variable genes were identified using ‘highly_variable_genes’ in Seurat&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 65" title="Satija, R., Farrell, J.

The expression data for the highly variable genes were scaled and used as input in PCA generated using the singular value decomposition (SVD) solver method in the ‘arpack’ algorithm implemented in Scanpy. PCs from the PCAs were then used to compute a neighbourhood graph generated using the Scanpy function ‘pp.neighbors’, which afterwards was embedded and visualized as a UMAP constructed with the Scanpy function tl.umap. For study I, the neighbourhood graph was constructed with the first 20 PCs and ‘n_neighbors’ set to 100. For study II, the neighbourhood graph was constructed with the first 40 PCs and ‘n_neighbors’ set to 30 for each of the 3 datasets. The parameters were set based on visual inspections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the&lt;i&gt; P&lt;/i&gt; values from the top 100 most associated genes from the gene-discovery analysis of iPSYCH + gnomAD samples as input for scDRS analysis, which was done separately for the above-described data from studies I, II and III. The number of genes was set to 100, which is the recommended minimum number of genes for the method. The method computes, on the basis of the expression of these 100 most significant genes, one raw disease score per cell. In addition, 1,000 raw control scores were computed for each cell. The control scores were generated using Monte Carlo sampling, in which 1,000 gene sets were produced, each consisting of 100 genes with similar gene size, mean gene expression and expression variance to that observed for the disease gene set. The computation of scores was corrected for relevant covariates (see below) and the number of genes in each of the cells. The normalized disease score was compared with the empirical normalized control score distribution to estimate a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value that quantifies the association between the disease genes and their expression in individual cells. These scores were used in the downstream scDRS cell-type-level analysis to test the association between the scores and predefined cell types using a &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test and the top 5% quantile of the disease score of cells from the given cell type.

Both the compute-score and the perform-downstream functions were run with default settings on raw counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We included donor ID as a covariate in analyses of studies II and III. Information on donor ID was not available for study I, and we were therefore not able to correct for the potential effects of factors captured by the donor ID covariate; that is, differences in biological variance between individuals, potential technical variation linked to donor samples or unequal donor representation among cells. The day of cell collection (collected from week 6 to week 11) was also used as a covariate in analyses of data from study I. Sex was used as a covariate in the analyses of data from study II.

Logistic regression of ADHD status on the nine dummy variables was performed to estimate the impact on ADHD risk in each PGS pentile using individuals in the first pentile with no class I variants in constrained genes as reference. This was done separately for individuals with no class I variants in constrained genes and for individuals with at least one class I variant in constrained genes. The regression was adjusted for individual birth year, total number of variants, number of rare synonymous variants, percentage of exome target covered at a read depth of at least 20, mean read depth at sites within the exome target passing VQSR, sequencing wave, and the first ten PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec35"&gt;C-alpha test&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess whether the rare variants identified in ADHD and ASD come from the same underlying gene distribution, we performed C-alpha tests on the iPSYCH exome data, including both ADHD and ASD. This comparison was designed to be simultaneous. To start with, we identified individuals diagnosed with either ADHD or ASD by the end of 2016, along with a control group in the quality-controlled iPSYCH data (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 28,448). Subsequently, we defined and classified the rare variants into class I, class II and synonymous categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed a C-alpha test between ADHD without ASD (ADHD only) and ASD without ADHD (ASD only), regardless of ID comorbidity. In addition, we stratified the samples by the presence or absence of ID to perform C-alpha tests between ADHD only and ASD only.

&lt;p id="5bca948b-6d1e-4da9-b38e-5571ecb61607"&gt;Exercise has big benefits for the brain, but the exact reasons why have been mysterious. Now, new studies suggest that exercised muscles release brain-boosting substances into the blood — and at least in lab animals, that boost can be transferred from one individual to another via an injection of those substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, common explanations for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity/features/boost-brain-health.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity/features/boost-brain-health.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;why regular physical activity is good for the brain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed to better blood flow, less stress and a stronger heart. But those ideas didn't fully explain how movement directly affected neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="5bca948b-6d1e-4da9-b38e-5571ecb61607-2"&gt;Clues are emerging from animal research. In a study published in October in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899325005669?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899325005669?via%3Dihub" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brain Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one group of young adult mice ran freely on wheels for four weeks while others stayed sedentary. Scientists then isolated extracellular vesicles — molecular "packages" that carry proteins and genetic material — from the runners' blood and injected them into the sedentary mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4695f372-1fb4-4e7f-9723-1256d06a70bc"&gt;After getting these injections twice a week for four weeks, these treated sedentary mice grew about 50% more new brain cells in a memory-related region called the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/hippocampus" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/hippocampus"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hippocampus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, compared with untreated sedentary mice. Most of the new cells developed into mature neurons, a process known as neurogenesis. (For humans, there's &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/can-adults-make-new-brain-cells-new-study-may-finally-settle-one-of-neurosciences-greatest-debates" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/can-adults-make-new-brain-cells-new-study-may-finally-settle-one-of-neurosciences-greatest-debates"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ongoing debate around whether neurogenesis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; occurs in meaningful amounts in the adult brain.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/mgconnol" target="_blank" data-url="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/mgconnol" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Meghan Connolly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Alberta, told Live Science in an email that she was struck by how specific the effect was — vesicles isolated from running mice boosted neuron growth, while those from sedentary animals did not. The researchers don't yet know whether the vesicles entered the brain or acted indirectly through other bodily signals. But Connolly explained that the vesicles themselves carried many proteins linked to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/antioxidants" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/antioxidants"&gt;&lt;u&gt;antioxidant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; defenses and neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, this surge in new brain cells may matter only if those cells survive long enough to fully integrate into the brain's existing structure, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/l/u/p.j.lucassen/p.j.lucassen.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/l/u/p.j.lucassen/p.j.lucassen.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Paul Lucassen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist at the University of Amsterdam who was not part of the study. The study zoomed in on "newborn neurons that still need weeks to grow and wire themselves into the brain's existing circuits," he told Live Science in an email.

In AD, neurons malfunction and die off over time in part due to a buildup of abnormal proteins, including amyloid and tau. In the experiment, one set of mice ran voluntarily on wheels for six months while another group was sedentary; the active mice showed less amyloid buildup in the cortex and better metabolism and memory than their counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another part of that study, the researchers gave vesicles from mice that had just exercised to sedentary Alzheimer's-model animals.

He told Live Science in an email that his group is now running follow-up experiments with human participants, comparing vesicles heading to and from the brain during exercise. Preliminary results hint that the vesicles heading toward the brain may be enriched for proteins affecting cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vesicles may be only one piece of this puzzle. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_9846506342847547781&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-025-03955-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fexercise%2Fbrain-benefits-of-exercise-come-from-the-bloodstream-and-they-may-be-transferrable-mouse-study-finds" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03955-6" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-025-03955-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fexercise%2Fbrain-benefits-of-exercise-come-from-the-bloodstream-and-they-may-be-transferrable-mouse-study-finds" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Other recent studies in humans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggest that regular exercise likely helps the brain via multiple biological pathways.

It’s a mixed answer, but the bright spot is scientific progress on vaccines. The Covid vaccines were produced faster than any previous effort, and are credited with &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;saving millions of lives from 2021&lt;/a&gt; onwards. The mRNA vaccines – Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna – were designed within days of the Sars-CoV-2 genome being published in January 2020, and went into safety trials over the following months before finally being approved in the UK at the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But could they have additional benefits? According to a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03432-7" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in Nature, mRNA vaccines seem to trigger a powerful immune response that increases the median survival time by about 75% for certain cancer patients. These findings – which are being further developed – could indicate the power of repurposing vaccines and medicines that have already passed trials for safety and are available at reasonable cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;How could Covid vaccines play a part in cancer treatment? Cancer develops when normal cells in the body grow and divide without control. Usually, cell division is strictly controlled, but when certain mutations happen – sometimes caused by tobacco, or radiation, inherited genetic factors or environmental exposure – the body is no longer able to stop uncontrolled cell growth. These cells (often referred to as malignant) build up to form a tumour – an abnormal growth. To keep growing, these cells create new blood vessels to feed themselves and start to spread around the body – called metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Our immune system is excellent at recognising invaders in our body – think of viruses or bacteria – but given that cancerous cells are part of our body, they prove hard for our immune system to distinguish from healthy cells. In treating cancer, doctors have several options. Surgery or radiotherapy is usually the start, to simply remove or target localised cancerous cells. If they have spread throughout the body, then chemotherapy is necessary: basically “nuking” the body to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs target cells that divide quickly to stop tumours growing, but this means they also kill off healthy cells in hair follicles, the stomach lining and bone marrow. It’s a blunt and barbaric intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Immunotherapy is a more targeted approach: its aim is to prime the immune system to attack only cancerous cells. Most of the research efforts here have focused on developing targeted vaccines and drugs for specific cancers, which means a long and expensive process of testing for safety, efficacy and dosage. But what appears to happen with mRNA vaccines is something different: it looks as if they activate the immune system in general, and this helps the body fight cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers in the US looked at the medical records of patients with stage 3 and stage 4 lung cancer treated between 2015 and 2022 at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Of those, 180 patients had received a Covid mRNA vaccine – either Pfizer or Moderna – within 100 days of starting immunotherapy treatment. In this observational study, the researchers compared them with 704 patients who had the same drugs but did not have the Covid jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After controlling for age, disease severity and other confounding factors, the results were striking: vaccinated patients lived a median of 37.3 months compared with 20.6 months in the unvaccinated group. Three years after starting treatment, 55.7% of vaccinated patients were alive compared with 30.8% of those who weren’t. A similar pattern was found when looking at a second group of patients with metastatic melanoma (a skin cancer that has spread around the body). The same benefit was found regardless of whether it was Pfizer or Moderna, but not in non-mRNA Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The gains are significant and far beyond the norm for most cancer drugs. A study &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10333065/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reviewing the clinical impact&lt;/a&gt; of 124 new cancer drugs approved by the US FDA between 2003 and 2021 found that, on average, new drugs increased median overall survival only by 2.8 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To delve deeper into these findings, scientists studied the impact of mRNA vaccines in mice. They found that pairing an mRNA vaccine with immunotherapy helped activate the immune system and turn previously hidden (“cold”) tumours into recognisable ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What could explain this? The researchers suggest that mRNA vaccines act as a flare, activating immune cells throughout the body. This doesn’t directly target cancer, but primes the immune system to be more alert and responsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If these findings are confirmed in other studies, this could revolutionise how cancer is treated. As &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/study-finds-covid-19-mrna-vaccine-sparks-immune-response-to-fight-cancer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Dr Elias Sayour,&lt;/a&gt; an oncologist and a co-author of the study, said: “We could design an even better non-specific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all patients.” Because Covid mRNA vaccines have already been tested for safety in millions of people, researchers see potential in repurposing them as a low-risk, inexpensive way to boost the immune system alongside traditional cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-11" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Matters of Opinion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"matters-of-opinion","successDescription":"Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The findings come from an observational study – that is, looking back at medical records of patients, rather than one designed from the ground up to test this effect – meaning it can show association, not causation. Randomised control trials (or RCTs) are needed to confirm whether it is indeed the vaccine making the difference. Animal studies are also needed to further examine the exact biological mechanism beyond just general immune system activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But just imagine having more precise and effective cancer treatments without the heavy toll and side-effects of chemotherapy. I remember my father suffering through round after round of chemo and wondering if the cure was worse than the disease. The Nature study is a reminder that science often advances in surprising ways. The mRNA Covid vaccines may not only have saved lives during the pandemic – they might also save lives from cancer too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;

Refined sugars like corn syrup and table sugar have a different effect on the body to sugars found in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;sources like fruit, vegetables, and whole grains, because they don't contain fiber or healthy fats, which help keep blood sugar levels stable. Over time, too many spikes can lead to insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating lots of sugar is linked to a higher risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, but there's also some evidence to suggest it impacts our skin. A 2022 systematic review published in the journal JAAD International found a "modest yet significant" link between a diet high in refined sugar and acne, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You need to have that slice of cake when you want it. What I try to do is keep things away from home," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavda-Sitaram applies moisturizer, vitamin C serum, and retinol daily, but said that unless you're leading a healthy lifestyle too, topical products aren't going to give you the glow you're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
