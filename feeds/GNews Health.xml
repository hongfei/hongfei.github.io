    &lt;p&gt;Diane Davis thought a diagnosis of advanced ovarian cancer was the answer she had been looking for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For months, she had been sick. Antibiotics were no help. When she went to the emergency room, a CT scan and MRI showed no definitive answers. She bounced from specialist to specialist. A colonoscopy showed nothing. All the while, Davis had lower back pain and was so nauseous she could barely eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just got sicker and sicker," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2017, she found herself in the office of Dr. Christopher Darus, a gynecologic oncologist at MaineHealth Maine Medical Center. He was concerned by the multiple cases of cancer in her family history. He scheduled her for exploratory surgery for the next day and found a softball-sized ovarian tumor that had spread to other organs. At last, Davis knew what she was facing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was devastating, obviously, but I was relieved too, because at least now we knew," Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darus, who removed the mass during the surgery, outlined a plan to treat the advanced ovarian cancer. Next would be chemotherapy. But after three cycles of chemo, Darus found a new mass growing in her pelvis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's "extremely rare, extremely ominous" for ovarian cancer to return that quickly, Darus said. Generally, women whose cancer does not return within six months have a better prognosis. Those whose cancer recurs faster typically "live less than two years," Darus explained. To make matters worse, Davis' cancer had also spread to her lymph nodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I did not expect, halfway through chemotherapy, to be in a worse situation than I was when I was first diagnosed," Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;"Like a ping-pong ball" &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darus submitted Davis' tumor for molecular testing, which identified unique biomarkers and led to her diagnosis with a condition called Lynch syndrome. The condition is "essentially a cancer syndrome," said Dr. Paul Oberstein, a medical oncologist at NYU Langone who studies it. A person with Lynch syndrome is more susceptible to different forms of cancer, including ovarian cancer. The diagnosis gave context to the Davis family's cancer history and opened the door for more treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are at least four proteins that can be involved in Lynch syndrome, Darus said. The proteins typically help repair DNA. If one or more proteins are missing, as they are in Lynch patients, mistakes in the cells can accumulate, Darus said. That "is like having a messy room" to the immune system: The body knows something is wrong and immune cells will migrate to the area, Darus said. But the cancer can turn off those immune cells, so the body doesn't respond appropriately and the cancer begins to form. The tumors that arise in Lynch syndrome may have 50, 100 or more mutations, Oberstein said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That large number of mutations makes it easier for a person's immune system to respond to the tumor, Oberstein said. Using immunotherapy to activate a Lynch syndrome patient's immune system against those cancer cells can lead to positive outcomes in many cases, he said, though no treatment works for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With few options, Darus started looking at drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which "unmask" tumors and allow the immune system to attack cancer cells. After the Food and Drug Administration approved a drug called pembrolizumab for some patients in June 2017, he was able to prescribe it to Davis. She received the immunotherapy treatment every three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within two treatments, the new mass in Davis' pelvis was gone, and the cancer on her lymph nodes was receding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was kind of like a ping-pong ball: You get diagnosed, and then you get sick again, and then having the immunotherapy just swung me right back to feeling good," Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Finding new hope   &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis' Lynch syndrome diagnosis changed her family. Lynch syndrome is genetic, with about a 50% chance of it being passed from parent to child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis was the first in her family to be diagnosed with it, but her family has traced it back to her paternal grandfather. Her father and uncle, who both passed away from cancer in their 60s, likely had it. Davis' brother and two sisters were also diagnosed with the condition. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She encouraged her children to get a screener for it. Her son tested negative, but her daughter was positive. She immediately started early cancer screenings. A colonoscopy when Davis' daughter was 29, more than a decade earlier than most people begin receiving such tests, found a "very, very large precancerous polyp." It was removed without complication, Davis said. Today, her daughter remains in good health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At 29 years old, she would not have had that screenings until she had much more serious symptoms," Davis said. "So it's been really good in that respect." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis stayed on the immunotherapy treatment for two years. Six years later, she is still healthy and thriving, with her cancer in complete remission. She still gets regular scans and is at higher risk of being diagnosed with other forms of cancer. Instead of dwelling on what the future may hold, she focuses on her grandkids, who visit often for activities like hiking and snowmobiling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been amazing. It's getting further and further in the distance, which is really strange, because when the chemotherapy failed, I pretty much thought, 'This is it.' I didn't think the future looked very promising at that moment. I thought I had maybe six months, given the speed at which the cancer grew," Davis said. "But it was amazing. It was really, really amazing." &lt;/p&gt;

I’ve gone from, “Addiction is complicated and I love my parents, but they can’t change,” to “F these people, they put their two kids at risk.” How do I figure out what to do here?&lt;/p&gt;

One of the surprises for you is a reconsideration of your own childhood and your parents’ parenting of you. This particular category of surprise is not uncommon. There’s nothing quite like contemplating the utterly vulnerable, perfect, beloved brand-new human being in your arms to make you suddenly aware, in a way that’s impossible to brush off, of the mistakes, deep flaws, failures, and bad decisions of your own parents in your infancy and childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhpegopn00193b79xg3q5v00@published"&gt;I think it’s fair to say that many revelations about one’s old childhood—like yours—do not constitute new information. Like many adults, until now you managed to compartmentalize the past—your parents’ smoking, the harm it caused you, and their failure to even attempt to quit—in a way that kept you from feeling (at least consciously) hurt, bewildered, and angry. Your son’s birth cracked that compartment open. Now the question is: What to do with that opened-up Pandora’s box of feelings?&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="165" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhpegorf001a3b79fsu533c7@published"&gt;Don’t try to tamp them down (they’ll just pop back up). Once opened, the box cannot be closed. So feel your feelings, as unpleasant and destabilizing as they are right now. Talk about them to anyone you’re sure will be a good listener—compassionate, kind, and disinclined either to debate you &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; egg you on (or to try to “fix” you). Your husband might be a good place to begin. Your brother might be too. But don’t underestimate the value of talking to good friends—people who love you but have no personal stake in the issue at hand. And, of course, if your parents are the kind of people who can be talked to frankly and openly without getting defensive or going on the attack (I won’t simply assume they’re not! I am ever-optimistic!), have a conversation with them, too. But if you find that you are &lt;em&gt;consumed&lt;/em&gt; with rage, are becoming depressed or extremely anxious, then talking to a therapist would be an excellent idea.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhpegotg001b3b79dabh7b8q@published"&gt;Once you begin to deal with the feelings about your childhood that have bubbled to the surface, you’ll be able to confront and make a decision about the issue at hand. Letting your parents meet their grandson—and, beyond that, allowing them to be in his life—does not have to be tightly entwined with how you feel about your own childhood: It can be decoupled from that, if you wish to decouple it.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhpegovy001c3b79xk5sdepn@published"&gt;I want to be clear. I’m not saying you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; introduce your baby this winter as planned. If you are still too hurt and angry to do that, put it off. Don’t force yourself to go through something that will further pain you. Make an excuse if you like. Or if you’d prefer to confront things directly, tell your parents the truth (no matter what kind of people they are), letting them know you need time to work through this, and set a tentative future date. You can always postpone that date if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="155" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhpegoy1001d3b79ssoblrkc@published"&gt;It seems your parents are open to making an effort where their grandchild is concerned (there are plenty of grandparents who would be offended by being asked to change into new, clean clothes!), and I gather you’d be seeing them in your own home or on neutral grounds for the holidays, not in their smoky, smelly house. I would hope that they’ve committed to not smoking in his presence (if not, go ahead and lay down those ground rules). So the questions to consider are these: Do you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; your child to have a relationship with his grandparents, or not? Do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; want to continue to have a relationship with your parents, or not? If the answers to these questions are yes, you’re going to make sure both these things happen—if not now, then eventually. And if you’re uncertain about the answers to these questions … well, then, be patient with yourself. Give yourself grace.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhpeqpkv002k3b791oiz7sj2@published"&gt;My children (10, 8, 6, and 5) have been attending school virtually since March. Our 5-year-old misses his friends and the in-person nature of school, but has been doing very well in long-distance kindergarten. He’s always been a little bit behind (within normal parameters) for self-regulating and similar skills, but he’s not regressed too much. My mother-in-law moved in with us in August, for the foreseeable future, and my partner and I have noticed that she treats the 5-year-old differently than she did the others at the same age, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/12/mil-too-harsh-discipline-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;especially when it comes to discipline.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It also seemed they may not readily cross the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-think-theyre-on-the-verge-of-breaching-the-blood-brain-barrier"&gt;blood brain barrier&lt;/a&gt;: a decisive checkpoint for any drugs targeting the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But newer studies have overcome these challenges, with animal model lab experiments showing that engineered nanobodies can cross the blood brain barrier to target and eliminate key markers of Alzheimer's disease thought to drive symptoms, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58383-4"&gt;tau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24032632"&gt;amyloid beta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Camelid nanobodies open a new era of biologic therapies for brain disorders and revolutionize our thinking about therapeutics," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/camels-and-llamas-could-hold-the-key-to-treating-future-brain-disorders"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Philippe Rondard, neuropharmacologist at CNRS. "We believe they can form a new class of drugs between conventional antibodies and small molecules."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before these drugs get anywhere near a living human brain, scientists will need to evaluate their stability, proper folding, and ensure the absence of aggregation, Rondard says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"These are highly soluble small proteins that can enter the brain passively," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/camels-and-llamas-could-hold-the-key-to-treating-future-brain-disorders"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; functional genomicist Pierre-André Lafon. "By contrast, small-molecule drugs that are designed to cross the blood-brain barrier are hydrophobic in nature, which limits their bioavailability, increases the risk of off-target binding, and is linked to side effects."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also need to know more about exactly how they're crossing the blood brain barrier, and how long they hang around in the brain, to ensure proper dosage. Scientists will also need to develop clinical-grade, stable formulations that can survive long-term storage and transport, from lab to patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our lab has already started to study these different parameters for a few brain-penetrant nanobodies and has recently shown that conditions of treatment are compatible with chronic treatment," Lafon &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/camels-and-llamas-could-hold-the-key-to-treating-future-brain-disorders"&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one day we will be thanking camels for saving our precious memories – but it's still a long way off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2025.10.004"&gt;Trends in Pharmacological Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, that is true! Read on to know more…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Perlmutter says that while exercise is one of the most powerful ways to build new brain cells, amidst that, walking is the clear winner. According to the doctor, taking walks can actually stimulate the formation of new neurons. This simple, free and no fuss activity, can bolster memory and decelerate the onset of cognitive decline. In an IG video, Dr Perlmutter laid out the data that demonstrate how walking, and other forms of movement, can reshape the brain in a new direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fires up the brain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Perlmutter points to research showing that taking walks can actually kick‑start the birth of new brain cells, a process scientists call neurogenesis. Key areas of the brain involved in memory particularly the hippocampus, grow larger with regular physical activity. In a landmark trial involving adults those who logged a year of walking, ended up with roughly 2 % larger hippocampus size, than the participants who stuck to stretching alone; on the other hand, the stretch‑only group even experienced a slight shrinkage. This growth matters, because the hippocampus is crucial for both forming new memories, and pulling them back when we need them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking walks fortifies this brain area, helping it stay robust and fend off the impacts of aging and illnesses such as Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How walking helps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Perlmutter, getting your body moving sends a burst of signals to your brain urging it to stay sharp and alert. Those cues essentially tell your brain that you’re actively engaging with your surroundings, prompting neurons to stay healthy and tightly linked. Exercise also ramps up blood flow and oxygen delivery to brain tissue improving brain activity. Not only that, constant movement nudges muscles to release a mix of signaling molecules called myokines, among which the well‑known brain‑derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a role. BDNF plays the role of a fertiliser for brain cells, nudging the creation of neurons, while bolstering the survival and performance of the ones already present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Major boost for brain health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a stroll is one of the best ways to get the heart pumping, and the blood flowing, and it doesn't demand any fancy equipment or a gym card. According to Dr. Perlmutter, a quick dose of movement, like a regular walk, gives a boost to every system that fuels the brain-from immunity and metabolism, to neuroplasticity (the brain’s ability to adapt and rewire). Clocking in a handful of walking sessions each week, can actually increase brain matters that govern memory, cognition and emotional regulation. The best part is that walking is accessible to all, without any limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Reduces risk of cognitive decline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to research highlighted by Dr. Perlmutter, taking a stroll does more than grow new cells - it also appears to slow the slide of cognitive decline. Larger brain volumes and elevated BDNF levels, have been linked to a risk of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. A range of studies shows that people who make walks a habit, tend to preserve memory, keener attention and more agile problem‑solving abilities, as they age. Those benefits in turn, help them stay independent longer and enjoy a steady quality of life. A steady walking routine pushes back on inflammation and other dangerous mechanisms that wear down tissue, making it a crucial non‑pharmacological approach, to brain protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How to walk for brain health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Perlmutter recommends a consistent routine: walk for at least thirty minutes a day most days of the week. You don’t need to be an athlete, he says: just move enough to raise your heart rate and breathe a little heavier (the rule of thumb is that you should be able to talk, but not sing) If thirty minutes feels challenging at first, break it into 2 sessions of 15 minutes each. Walking outside in a park, or garden also adds benefits like soaking up sunlight for vitamin D, and giving the mind a relaxing break. Pick routes that feel safe, so you can really enjoy your walk, and make sure that you wear the right shoes, since the wrong ones might leave you with pain, or worse, an injury. The trick is staying consistent, because that way your brain keeps soaking up those growth signals day after day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgJBVV95cUxNWTVhZTFSZThVRzhYcWxKZW1NMmRUX2d1d19Bcnp5U0x5bUJWMDdLX1BfWDZRR0VWLTNLdEdJYWxId042TnBNMHo0V2hxcjMwQ3NjbExPM3pJaFdCRDk0MUxwUWtYUTBHTUpVYm5lVG9XNDl3N2thaTRzQV9WN2YwcUdSb0NlNTVKVHNoQUNKREQ1NVlGN2xOVXBsMFVvTzk0Ni1vRElsMVFfc0xxUFA3M3R3U1hXSVJtUVVYNS1JMTM4S3k4WmhZTW5MVGdEMnZvdDdIU2liVW16clRXS3lHNFBJQjVDOWhxYTY3UWxaVUhXVHZJOXhPUTBsb2gwRmkydVhtTzFWWUhHSjJrOGI5MGp5NzB4QQ</guid></item><item><title>服用降压药的理想时间是什么时候？顶尖心脏病专家揭示令人惊讶的事实--《印度时报》</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/when-is-the-ideal-time-to-take-your-blood-pressure-medicine-top-cardiologist-reveals-surprising-fact/articleshow/125135399.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who suffer from Hypertension, or high Blood Pressure, often wonder when is the right time to take their blood‑pressure medication. Dr. Levine, a New York‑based cardiologist recently answered this in a video, according to research findings and patient‑focused strategies, for effective blood‑pressure control. Let’s dig deeper…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Is the timing important&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistently taking one’s medication is a way to keep hypertension in check, and cut down on the odds of heart attacks, strokes and kidney disease. For years, a handful of experts have speculated that the timing of taking the medicine, be it sunrise or bedtime, might change the outcomes. Dr. Levine however, argues that the ideal timing is simply the slot that merges best with an individual’s schedule; in practice, sticking to the regimen and making it convenient, outweighs any clock‑time considerations for most drugs, says Dr Levine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What Dr. Levine recommends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Levine advises his patients to take their blood‑pressure medication at whatever time they will remember it-he often suggests leaving the bottle by the bathroom sink, and taking a dose after brushing teeth. He stresses that this habit helps avoid skipping doses, which is a far bigger concern, than taking it at a particular time of the day. Skipping a dose, even for one day, can mess up your Blood Pressure readings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, patients should pick a routine that best fits their lifestyle, whether that means a morning, afternoon or evening dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What the data says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier investigations hinted that taking blood‑pressure pills at night might better curb the early‑morning spikes. However, latest studies, notably the TIME trial, found no meaningful difference in outcomes between morning and evening dosing. Cardiologists now agree that the crucial point is taking your medicine consistently, and not the hour on the clock. Whether you choose a morning dose, an evening dose or any time that fits your routine, the evidence shows each approach is equally safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Medication type matters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Levine notes that whenever feasible, a once‑daily dose is the right approach, rather than multiple doses. Requiring patients to take medication two or three times a day, often leads to confusion and missed pills-a problem especially common among older adults. He is particularly wary of instructions such, as "one and a half tablets twice a day", because they tend to reduce the likelihood of intake. Both his clinical experience and research findings confirm that adherence slips, as the number of doses rises, and shifting from a once‑daily to multiple doses can cut compliance by 14 %. If you have been prescribed multiple doses, talk to your doctor-he/she might be able to blend doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Individual preferences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, Dr. Levine stresses that physicians should personalise patient recommendations, and adjust medication seamlessly into each individual’s lifestyle, so it never slips the mind. You might decide to take your pill with breakfast right after you’ve brushed your teeth or at bedtime-just pick the slot you’re certain you won’t miss. This flexibility hands control back to the patient, that in the long run, tends to deliver stronger more durable results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Doctor suggestion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Levine says that certain physicians still endorse nighttime dosing for patients whose blood pressure fails to dip after dark-called the "non‑dippers." Following your doctor’s advice is reasonable, says Dr Levine, when a medical reason exist - whether it’s to sidestep side effects, mitigate diabetes risk, or because of the medication’s properties. (for instance, diuretics generally work better when taken in the morning). Dr Levine advises that if there is any doubt, one should bring it up with their doctor; but avoid altering the regimen on your own without guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The power of habit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Levine says that linking your medication to a habit, whether it’s brushing your teeth, grabbing breakfast or winding down for bedtime, greatly ups the odds, and you’ll actually remember to take it. Dr. Levine suggests putting the pill bottle at a place you’ll see every day. What really matters is staying consistent, and not nailing the minute on the clock. Skipping doses can push blood pressure higher, and wipe out the gains even if you otherwise regular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Using Diuretics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diuretics-often called "water tablets”-work best when taken in the morning, since they prompt the kidneys to fluid, and can interrupt sleep if taken at night. Likewise, many other medicines may interact with other health conditions, foods or other prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies confirm that patients who follow their prescription-no matter the hour-generally achieve better blood‑pressure control, and protect their heart. Dr. Levine suggests that whenever possible, consolidating medicines into one pill, can simplify the regimen and raise adherence. If your current schedule feels confusing, talk to your doctor about adjusting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwJBVV95cUxON1pVbkpWRFc1NkVFRktVdm5zSWJsSW1wN093Y092a0VtTmtaeEI0djVZcGExdUpndHF5QTdMRTNNeEktd2JNaFB6dVJmb3BnMGNudHZFOWJSX1JxSDgxbHFTT1l5TFk4Ul9KLW9GQkY0YXJ5ck14Z1YySzRQM05xUFdlMUctb0wxZXlIWWRBejcyRm9oQ3d6YlZvWV9ZZTNvTFYtUWxlNnRfTlZ5dGxJQWdrbEpWVDVGY3ZleTd2SjMtQzZTcmNNb2E3QkhpWkVCSEpZbkE0WUFhYzM1OGRNZHhJSXVGWlVRUVZxUVJrdW1QWFNvWHVjczBvWXprS1JKcjRvRmFybEJGRHNUM1ZXcmlZX01PS055WTZ6N3l0ZTNnRUZUZVVn</guid></item><item><title>七栋被带状疱疹覆盖的鳞片状房屋- Dezeen</title><link>https://www.dezeen.com/2025/11/08/scaly-shingles-houses-roundup/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="main-article-body"&gt;
                



                
                
                &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/barns/"&gt;barn&lt;/a&gt; in rural England and a lakeside &lt;a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/cottages/"&gt;cottage&lt;/a&gt; in Poland feature in this roundup of &lt;a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/houses/"&gt;homes&lt;/a&gt; with highly textured facades, finished with scaly-looking &lt;a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/shingles/"&gt;shingles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span id="more-2266242"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shingles are a type of roof and wall cladding formed of small overlapping elements, favoured for their durable and tactile qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can be made from everything from slate to thatch, but are most commonly made from wood – a variation known as shakes – with both smooth and rough surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples in this roundup demonstrate how shingles, especially when made of wood, can give rise to tactile, scaly-looking facades with a naturalistic quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on for seven houses sheathed in shingles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Grayley Architecture opted for a shingle exterior for this extension to Church Cottage in Suffolk to complement the existing 18th-century building's &lt;a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/thatch/"&gt;thatched&lt;/a&gt; roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shingle-covered walls were raised on a plinth of red &lt;a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/bricks/"&gt;bricks&lt;/a&gt; and were teamed with wooden window frames and a green roof, adding to the rustic charm of the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oyama and Julia Manaças Architecte designed this 260-square-metre home to blend in with its site in a forest clearing in Quebec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the studios divided it into three volumes to reduce its visual mass and unified them with walls of &lt;a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/cedar/"&gt;cedar&lt;/a&gt; shingles. They described this as creating "strange bodies in familiar clothing".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulties transporting equipment to the site of Bridge House – a home spanning a seven-metre-deep gorge in India – led its architecture studio, Wallmakers, to use locally available construction materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among them was &lt;a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/grass/"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;, used to create a scaly coat of thatched shingles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new smartphone-assisted test called LEO helps people who avoid gluten — an estimated 1% with celiac disease and another 6% with sensitivities — quickly screen foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using as little as 20 milligrams of a sample on a lateral-flow strip, LEO provides a visual result in about two minutes, with an optional app image that refines the estimate in one minute.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The system detected gliadin at 5 ppm with 98% accuracy — beating the FDA labeling threshold — and identified cross-contamination in restaurant foods labeled “gluten-free.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; About 1% of the United States population has celiac disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/signs-and-symptoms-gluten-sensitivity" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Children's Hospital of Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;. It explained that when people with celiac disease consume foods containing gluten, it can trigger an "autoimmune response that damages the small intestine and can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms, poor growth, and long-term problems, like anemia, osteoporosis, and even lymphoma." While those with celiac certainly experience more severe symptoms, an additional 6% of the population might also have a gluten sensitivity, making them feel unwell when they consume gluten products, too. That means several million people across the country do all they can to avoid it in food and drinks. But now, scientists have developed something new to make that job a lot easier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In September, researchers published a paper in the &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.5c07872" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;detailing their new gluten detection device, which could help millions of people avoid gluten with ease — and at a very low price. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The team, which included scientists from Taipei Medical University, named their device LEO, short for Lateral flow Enhanced by Optical imaging, and it works much like a high-tech home pregnancy or COVID-19 test that includes its own smartphone app, LEOMyFood.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s how the LEO test works: A diner takes a small crumb of food, as little as 20 milligrams, and places it into a small vial. They then add a few drops of liquid, similar to how one swabs their nose for at-home COVID-19 testing. Next, users put a few drops of the solution onto a test strip that detects gliadin, the gluten protein that triggers reactions in individuals with celiac disease. The test strip has three lines: one serves as a baseline, while the second and third lines detect lower and higher gluten levels, respectively. The entire process takes about two minutes. If users are unsure of the results, they can take a photo and upload it to the companion app, which provides a more detailed analysis within one minute.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In their lab tests, the team found that the LEO system accurately identified gluten levels as low as 5 ppm, meaning it outperforms the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/gluten-free-means-what-it-says" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Food and Drug Administration’s labeling threshold&lt;/a&gt; and detects gliadin with “98% accuracy.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They also tested the strips in real-world scenarios, including evaluating everyday restaurant meals and packaged snacks. They discovered that cross-contamination often happens in restaurants, especially when food is prepared in shared fryers and mixing bowls. The LEO device also successfully detected gluten traces in restaurant foods mislabeled as “gluten-free,” including fries and salads that had likely been exposed to cross-contamination during preparation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here's the best news about this scientific breakthrough: It's already available for purchase. Anyone can buy a sample pack of three for $35 or a jumbo pack of 40 for $250, making each one $6.25 on the &lt;a href="https://leoverified.com/collections/gluten-free-testers" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;LEO Verified site&lt;/a&gt;. However, the team hopes to bring these prices down eventually. “Our goal is to get it to them at the most reasonable price,” Seaton Smith, a cofounder of LEO Verification Systems, shared with &lt;a href="https://www.powelltribune.com/stories/powell-based-start-up-creates-new-convenient-way-to-test-for-gluten,166205" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Powell Tribune&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. “Because as a celiac, my breads cost twice as much as yours and tastes twice as terrible.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The team noted in their study that while the strips are currently designed for gluten testing, they could be adapted with minor modifications to detect other common food allergens, such as peanuts, shellfish, and dairy, in the future. That way, everyone can enjoy a stress-free meal.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="979fa198-3d51-4dec-bc42-d71b336ca033"&gt;If you’re trying to lose weight you might have heard that it’s good to eat more protein, particularly if you want to maintain lean muscle. But how much should we be eating to achieve this? And why is protein so important when it comes to dropping body fat and growing muscle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Dr Lena Rebecca Larsen, a nutrition specialist at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://morenutrition.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://morenutrition.co.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;More Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, who explained more about how this essential macronutrient can aid weight loss. “The feeling of satiety (fullness) that protein helps promote is a major factor. This can contribute to a reduced overall calorie intake which is key for losing body fat, however, there are a number of contributory elements that influence this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="979fa198-3d51-4dec-bc42-d71b336ca033-2"&gt;“Firstly, from a hormonal standpoint, protein affects the release of hormones that regulate appetite. It can decrease levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin, and increase levels of the hormones GLP-1 and cholecystokinin, which signal fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This feeling of fullness is also experienced due to protein as a macronutrient having a higher thermic effect of food, and so the body expends more calories during its digestion and when metabolising it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Plus, when you eat enough protein, this will help maintain muscle mass during a calorie deficit. Where your body might otherwise start breaking down muscle tissue for energy, it is more likely to oxidize fat effectively to burn fat for energy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-why-protein-intake-is-important-for-weight-loss" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-protein-intake-is-important-for-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why protein intake is important for weight loss &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="5b8e62d0-31cb-48d0-82d9-564bde24ea1e"&gt;“Studies have indicated that up to 25% of weight lost can come from muscle mass if protein intake is insufficient,” says Larsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says when you eat enough protein during your weight loss journey, you can maintain muscle mass. And because muscles burn more calories at rest compared with fat, this can also help you lose weight and avoid regaining it later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-MAQnQtPCVcX78WsfyAbDsm" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-MAQnQtPCVcX78WsfyAbDsm slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you’d expect, protein requirements vary based on lots of factors including activity levels, age and body composition. Larsen has come up with this protein formula, below, so you can work out your personalised needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“1.6g to 2g of protein per kilogram of body weight is a formula that can be used by men and women to work out roughly how much protein you should be consuming,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For very active people (ambitious hobby sports or competitive sports) or very overweight people, this amount should also be increased to 2.4g/kg. In bodybuilding with the aim of building muscle (and gaining weight) even higher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d recommend trying to split your individual protein calculation evenly across meals and snacks. Also, strength training can be incredibly beneficial if you’re looking to build or maintain lean muscle mass while losing body fat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The table below provides a good overview, taking into account that every person is individual and that these are average values.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-table-MAQnQtPCVcX78WsfyAbDsm-yPm2ZK9KaGaY3hBIrAq3yiP8Qe8ibDCb" class="slice-container table-wrapper table-MAQnQtPCVcX78WsfyAbDsm-yPm2ZK9KaGaY3hBIrAq3yiP8Qe8ibDCb slice-container-table"&gt;&lt;div class="table__instruction"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swipe to scroll horizontally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 23 30" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;path d="M21.554 15.726a2.878 2.878 0 0 0-1.705-.374 2.881 2.881 0 0 0-1.388-3.068 2.877 2.877 0 0 0-1.992-.333 2.884 2.884 0 0 0-.1-.766 2.865 2.865 0 0 0-1.346-1.75c-.47-.27-.996-.4-1.527-.385l2.742-4.73a2.87 2.87 0 0 0 .323-.83h2.612V2.084h-2.661A2.861 2.861 0 0 0 15.18.385a2.903 2.903 0 0 0-3.952 1.055l-.373.644H2.983l1.003-1L2.99.09 1.28 1.793l-.999.995L2.99 5.484l.998-.994-1.003-.999h7.054L6.505 9.586c-.34.066-.905.186-1.523.366-1.405.41-2.321.895-2.8 1.483-.742.911-1.159 2.513-1.277 4.898l-.001.01c-.067 1.816.946 6.943.99 7.16a.688.688 0 0 0 1.35-.266c-.01-.051-1.023-5.177-.963-6.84.127-2.556.598-3.64.97-4.098.133-.163.602-.587 2.104-1.027l.206-.058-1.425 2.458a.685.685 0 0 0 .252.937c.33.19.75.077.94-.251L12.42 2.126a1.52 1.52 0 0 1 2.07-.552c.35.2.6.527.705.916.105.39.051.797-.15 1.145l-4.767 8.222a.685.685 0 0 0 .252.937c.33.19.75.077.94-.25l.794-1.368c.201-.348.529-.597.92-.702a1.508 1.508 0 0 1 1.854 1.066c.105.39.052.796-.15 1.144l-.377.652-.002.002-.898 1.55a.685.685 0 0 0 .252.938c.329.189.75.077.94-.251l.9-1.551c.201-.348.528-.597.92-.702a1.512 1.512 0 0 1 1.703 2.21l-1.223 2.11a.685.685 0 0 0 .252.938c.33.189.75.076.941-.252l.5-.862c.202-.348.529-.597.92-.702.392-.104.8-.051 1.15.15.723.416.972 1.34.554 2.06l-3.525 6.08c-.517.892-1.57 1.795-3.044 2.611-1.156.64-2.163.998-2.173 1.002a.685.685 0 0 0 .23 1.333.688.688 0 0 0 .229-.04c.18-.062 4.419-1.575 5.952-4.22l3.524-6.08a2.878 2.878 0 0 0-1.059-3.934Z" fill="#333"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="table__container"&gt;&lt;table tabindex="0" class="table__wrapper table__wrapper--inbodyContent table__wrapper--sticky table__wrapper--divider"&gt;&lt;caption class="table__caption table__caption--top table__caption--left"&gt;Recommended protein intake by activity level or goal&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;thead class="table__head"&gt;&lt;tr class="table__head__row"&gt;&lt;th class="table__head__heading table__head__heading--left" colspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of person&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th class="table__head__heading table__head__heading--left" colspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective recommended protein intake (g/kg bw/day)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th class="table__head__heading table__head__heading--left" colspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody class="table__body"&gt;&lt;tr class="table__body__row"&gt;&lt;td class="table_body__data" colspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimally active (everyday life, walks)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="table_body__data" colspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.6 - 2.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="table_body__data" colspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/C5FO01530H" target="_blank"&gt;Wu (2016)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2017-097608" target="_blank"&gt;Morton, R.

Do you feel fitter? Are you performing better at sports? If not, then it may be—if there is no other reason, such as a metabolic disorder or illness—that the protein content is not yet sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Remember that the need for protein increases with age. So, a woman in her mid-50s may be surprised at how more protein is needed, even if she mainly does ‘relaxed’ sports such as walking and yoga.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-get-more-protein-into-your-diet" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-get-more-protein-into-your-diet"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to get more protein into your diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="youtube-video youtube-facade" data-nosnippet id="kST3tC9J-CU"&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Is it OK to mix and match meals if there's one I don't like?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7889605/diabetes-friendly-recipes-for-healthy-blood-sugar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;delicious diabetes-friendly recipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 295-339 calories while the lunches span 357-408 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What is the difference between natural and added sugars?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural sugars are found in fruit, vegetables and dairy foods. Added sugars are any type of sugar that has been added during the processing of a food. This can include "natural" sources like honey, agave and maple syrup. Once these sugars are added to a food, they become an added sugar. Unlike added sugars that only provide sweetness without nutrition benefits, foods containing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291857/heres-why-you-should-eat-fruit-even-though-it-contains-sugar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;natural sugars also have other nutrients&lt;/a&gt; like fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-tips-for-managing-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_156-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Tips for Managing Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_157-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose water and unsweetened drinks: &lt;/strong&gt;Because &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009374/best-and-worst-hydration-drinks-for-people-with-diabetes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sugar-laden drinks&lt;/a&gt; are a huge source of added sugars, opting for water, seltzer and other zero-carbohydrate drinks can have a beneficial impact on your blood sugar levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise: &lt;/strong&gt;Moving your body in whatever way feels good is always helpful, especially if you are aiming to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7834958/what-you-need-to-know-about-exercise-diabetes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower blood sugars&lt;/a&gt;. Exercise doesn't have to be extreme to have benefits. Research shows that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7998411/walking-after-meals-lower-blood-sugar-science/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;walking for just two minutes after each meal&lt;/a&gt; can benefit your blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair carbohydrates with protein or fat:&lt;/strong&gt; Pairing carbs with foods containing protein or fat helps reduce blood sugar spikes, keeps you fuller for longer and provides more stable energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Increasing fiber, a type of carbohydrate that's not digested, has a ton of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, including improved blood sugar levels.&lt;/li&gt;

Thankfully, he got resuscitated, but insisted on going to work that same day! Dr Kunal Sood, MD, recently put up a video explaining that while heart attacks can be fatal, if you survive one, recovery and rest is equally important to prevent a repeat episode…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kunal Sood advises that the path to post‑heart‑attack recovery should rest on measures aimed at restoring health, and enhancing overall quality of life. He blends guidance with everyday lifestyle tweaks, underscoring the need to spot warning signs early and to cultivate supportive habits. Let’s take a look…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Tune in to warning signs…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sood stresses that even the faintest alarm from the heart shouldn’t be dismissed-even tiny changes can be significant. He points out that new chest ache palpitations, accompanied by fainting, or shortness of breath, swelling in the legs, all call for medical attention. Ignoring these cues can postpone treatment, and worsen the outlook. If anything feels off, call a doctor right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Stay on track with your medication plan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medicines your doctor prescribes are meant to prevent clot formation, keep your blood pressure down, and keep the heart’s rhythm in check. Dr. Sood urges everyone to keep up with their medicines, and never miss a dose, or stop taking medicine, without talking to the doctor first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Eat foods that keep your heart healthy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opt for foods that nurture your heart-colorful fruit, crunchy vegetables, whole‑grain staples, lean protein sources and beneficial fats. Dr. Sood advises cutting out processed items, an overabundance of salt, sugary treats and saturated fats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise smoking and heavy drinking should be avoided, given their tendency to damage blood vessels and elevate blood pressure. Embracing a Mediterranean‑style diet can shield the heart, and promote blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving the body gives the heart a chance to bounce back while keeping weight in check. Dr. Sood recommends low‑key options, such as a stroll, a jog, or a 20‑30 minute session on a stationary bike, each day. It’s wise to consult your doctor before starting, and to stop the routine the moment chest pain, breathlessness or dizziness surface. Over time, steady activity eases the strain on the heart, and gradually builds strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sleep well, and keep rest at bay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rest plays a key role in the healing journey. Dr. Sood advises that a good night’s sleep and a steady sleep schedule, are non‑negotiable. Engaging in calming pursuits-meditation, deep‑breathing techniques or quality time with loved ones, can bolster emotional health and keep relapse at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Quit smoking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tobacco eats away at the arteries and bumps up the risk of heart disease. Dr. Sood says quitting smoking is one of the best steps you can take to protect your heart. Even the tiniest amount of tobacco, chewing tobacco included, should be stopped, because it makes recovery harder and raises the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Maintaining weight and blood pressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrying weight taxes the heart, and can drag out the recovery timeline. Dr. Sood suggests maintaining an ideal weight, keeping a watch on salt intake, and having blood pressure measured on a routine basis. When that surplus fat drops, the odds of another heart attack shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Get a support system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recovering from a heart attack feels less overwhelming when friends, family or a support group step, in to help. Dr. Sood advises leaning on others, asking for assistance and sharing worries. Such emotional support can reduce stress, and sustain motivation, which is crucial for long‑term heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Consistent health check‑ups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a heart attack, staying on schedule with visits to your doctor becomes essential. Dr. Sood underscores the importance of blood work and cardiac scans, to catch any trouble early on. Throughout recovery, physicians often lean on imaging, lab tests and a range of tools to steer treatment and keep complications at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Red flags that demand urgent attention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An abrupt uneasy pressure in the chest that radiates toward the jaw, arm or neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A manifested swelling, in the legs, or a sudden spell of breathlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palpitations, those flutterings of the heart, may be accompanied by vertigo or even a sudden loss of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental fog for days at a stretch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sood says that one should never ignore these warning signs, especially if they occur after a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 05:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAJBVV95cUxObkNXVF93M2Jnc3JLZjlGLThPdlR6cjBjR09uNWRYN0JzdGVBdmxDelZVdWwtTFN3TUFiaGd1LVFaLUdpOERBaTM1bm1EVlRlTUFQOGE0WEVMS0FDaGFsQWJPUm5ndWo5MmphVUM3R3Y4clV1T3BDOFd6UXBVcW81NmVYVWpuanphejRIdm5IcFMwV1NoVTR3SkRxbmVsS3plTDk1enU2a1VOZmZsZVRwcWJiZS1wYl9FcjNXLWRGWFlLMEF2VjlPV05OeDNKaUpEWGsyQnVaNGtvanlGUUJ3MEIxY2F1UWpNUVU0Q0xiZF9hUm9zdVFmRDJ3VEtyMk41RzVLZFRJNU93alBxZ3hRWHZrb3UzVER0dXhRTzkzNHFHZnBCSzNZUjl5WE9vc1N0eV9kSURDV2pJMnI4R21VdEh4NXpIVExm</guid></item><item><title>根据科学家的说法，这种病毒性护肤趋势实际上是有效的- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/according-to-scientists-this-viral-skincare-trend-actually-works/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 04:47:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPbGZmY1g3VUhTd0FWOHJHS25heGpKQU12VEJsYlRkaVVJY3BwN2I1RWF0R2h3Q2dBdmdMYUZoUHBwcnk1aFVkcmtPajNGdWJRR25tLUl4UmtQVlZUSzBZZnZ2cDBoX3BUU3MyQWZBd19HRmVjMkNoT04ybVEyZEI0UmdsOWZxWllWUEdVZ04welFvTTd1</guid></item><item><title>一直便秘？ 5种医生批准的食物组合，帮助您自然排便-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/constipated-all-the-time-5-doctor-approved-food-combinations-that-help-you-poop-naturally/photostory/125177679.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Alka's approach is refreshingly simple. She suggests listening to one's body, sticking to a routine with these combinations, and adjusting their times according to one's needs. Start with hydration, make movement a non-negotiable, load up on fiber, and then try these soothing, fiber-rich pairings. You really don't need expensive supplements or strong medications for most cases of mild constipation; nature often provides what you need&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pairing the right fruits with soothing liquids at the right time can gently support our digestive system and help with occasional stomach-related issues, such as constipation. It is imperative to understand that these solutions are not for chronic constipation and if the issues persist, it is better to consult a medical health professional, as it could be an underlying symptom of a disease not been well diagnosed. As Dr. Alka emphasises, blending evidence-backed nutrition with traditional wisdom makes the gut happy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 04:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>肥胖症的发现震惊了科学家，挑战了60年的信仰-SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/obesity-discovery-stuns-scientists-challenges-60-year-old-beliefs/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 04:12:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNQjdEUGFVdDVPVUZJTGVLend2emRmX3k3N1dNQUFyS1kzZ0FfWElJeHNOVDN0NWluYWRxTk5MMmZwdEtVbDJqMXpOQzFJSlU0a1BWM0NfTWFqMUFyS1AxZ0FqY3E1dHkxTFRqOEN3azBaRDFKM0sxUlJpZzJaTHlHUnZFLVhRWGRLbXZGdGE0VTFoZlQxd2c</guid></item><item><title>肾脏疾病是十大死亡原因之一； 8亿人受到影响，大多数人甚至不知道：以下是如何及早发现肾脏疾病的方法-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/kidney-disease-among-top-10-causes-of-death-800-million-people-affected-and-most-dont-even-know-it-heres-how-to-catch-it-early/photostory/125177425.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The countries with the highest number of individuals with CKD in 2023 were China (152 million; 142–164) and India (138 million; 129–148), with the USA, Indonesia, Japan, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, the Philippines, Viet Nam, Thailand, and Türkiye all having more than 10 million adults with CKD," the report says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 02:48:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>从镁到钾：支持健康血压的5种必需营养素-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/from-magnesium-to-potassium-5-essential-nutrients-that-support-healthy-blood-pressure/articleshow/125150685.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;High Blood Pressure, also known as a 'silent killer' , is a serious concern that can increase the risk of heart disease and strokes over time. While lifestyle changes, cutting back on salt, and exercise might be the key to keeping blood pressure in check, but some daily nutrients also play a major role in controlling high blood pressure. Certain nutrients have been shown to support healthy blood pressure naturally, and research published in NIH, PubMed Central, all highlight five particular vitamins that are essential for our heart health and overall wellbeing. And these are...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium helps the blood vessels relax, which is great for the heart. and blood flow. Studies published in the National Institute of Health highlight the role of magnesium for hypertension management, and suggest that magnesium intake of 500 mg/gl to 1000 mg/f may reduce blood pressure and as much as 5.6/2.8 mm Hg. Infact, the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25129" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Heart Association Journals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;also recommend that magnesium is beneficial in reducing BP among people with hypertension and hypomagnesemia. Magnesium works by helping the body release nitric oxide, which opens up the blood vessels and reduces resistance, making the heart muscles to function better, thereby pumping blood more efficiently&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Natural Ways to Control High Blood Pressure Effectively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Omega-3 Fatty Acids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long chain omega-3 fatty acids, known as EPA and DHA found in fish oil, might be a meaningful way to lower blood pressure. A 2014 study published in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24610882/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;PubMed Central&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; follows a randomised trial, which found that EPA+DHA led to an average reduction of about 1.5 mmHg in systolic and 1.0 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure levels across all participants. The reason? EPA and DHA are these healthy fats that helps to reduce inflammation, improve blood vessels and lower vascular resistance. High-quality recommended supplements and fish oil may be a smart part of the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potassium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium plays a crucial role in maintaining a healthy balance of sodium within the human body. It aids in relaxing the walls of blood vessels, which in turn facilitates the excretion of sodium through urine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), an increase in dietary potassium intake is shown to significantly lower blood pressure among adults. Foods rich in this essential element include bananas, spinach, and sweet potatoes, which are notably effective in promoting health. Additionally, a study published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) revealed that an average increase of 4.7 grams (or 120 mmol) of dietary potassium per day is correlated with a notable reduction in blood pressure, with averages of 8.0/4.1 mm Hg recorded, varying according to race and the relative intake of other minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Calcium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calcium consumption, however, exerts a rather modest effect on blood pressure compared to the other nutrients. Consistently, supplementation of calcium has been shown to decrease systolic blood pressure by about 1.4 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by about 1.5 mm Hg.One such meta-analysis is published in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.HYP.31.1.131" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Heart Association Journals,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; it suggests that calcium supplementation has a small effect (−1.7 mm) on systolic blood pressure in hypertensive but not normotensive patients. It is involved in the contraction and relaxation of the wall of the blood vessels, and its proper intake is essential to maintain the blood pressure within its normal range. Recommendation for enough intake of calcium from dairy or plant origin is necessary, especially for those people with low dietary calcium&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between vitamin D and blood pressure often sparks controversy, especially when considering the cholecalciferol form of the vitamin. As research continues to develop in this area, some important findings are beginning to surface. A recent meta-analysis featured in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29776759/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;PubMed Central&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; indicates that vitamin D can lead to a modest reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings, primarily in individuals who are vitamin D deficient or those living with diabetes. While the results remain mixed and somewhat ambiguous, one conclusion can be drawn: supplementation of vitamin D may provide some beneficial effects for people experiencing high blood pressure, though it is less likely to significantly influence those who already maintain adequate levels of vitamin D and have no underlying metabolic risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 02:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>常见的甜味剂可能会损坏关键的大脑屏障，危及中风- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/erythritol-sweetener-blood-brain-barrier-study</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Found in everything from protein bars to energy drinks, erythritol has long been considered a safe alternative to sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But research suggests this widely used sweetener may be quietly undermining one of the body's most crucial protective barriers – with potentially serious consequences for heart health and stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Colorado suggests erythritol may damage cells in the blood-brain barrier, the brain's security system that keeps out harmful substances while letting in nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings add troubling new detail to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9"&gt;previous observational studies&lt;/a&gt; that have linked erythritol consumption to increased rates of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/21-year-study-links-gum-disease-and-cavities-to-higher-stroke-risk"&gt;21-Year Study Links Gum Disease And Cavities to Higher Stroke Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the recent study, researchers exposed blood-brain barrier cells to levels of erythritol typically found after drinking a soft drink sweetened with the compound. They saw a chain reaction of cell damage that could make the brain more vulnerable to blood clots – a leading cause of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol triggered what scientists call oxidative stress, flooding cells with harmful, highly reactive molecules known as free radicals, while simultaneously reducing the body's natural antioxidant defences. This double assault damaged the cells' ability to function properly, and in some cases killed them outright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps more concerning was erythritol's effect on the blood vessels' ability to regulate blood flow. Healthy blood vessels act like traffic controllers, widening when organs need more blood – during exercise, for instance – and tightening when less is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They achieve this delicate balance through two key molecules: nitric oxide, which relaxes blood vessels, and endothelin-1, which constricts them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that erythritol disrupted this critical system, reducing nitric oxide production while ramping up endothelin-1. The result would be blood vessels that remain dangerously constricted, potentially starving the brain of oxygen and nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This imbalance is a known warning sign of &lt;a href="https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0211-9"&gt;ischaemic stroke&lt;/a&gt; – the type caused by blood clots blocking vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more alarming, erythritol appeared to sabotage the body's natural defence against blood clots. Normally, when clots form in blood vessels, cells release a "clot buster" called &lt;a href="https://bmjopenrespres.bmj.com/content/6/1/e000440"&gt;tissue plasminogen activator&lt;/a&gt; that dissolves the blockage before it can cause a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the sweetener blocked this protective mechanism, potentially leaving clots free to wreak havoc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The laboratory findings align with troubling evidence from human studies. Several large-scale observational studies have found that people who regularly consume erythritol face significantly higher risks of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9"&gt;One major study&lt;/a&gt; tracking thousands of participants found that those with the highest blood levels of erythritol were roughly twice as likely to experience a major cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the research does have limitations. The experiments were conducted on isolated cells in laboratory dishes rather than complete blood vessels, which means the cells may not behave exactly as they would in the human body. Scientists acknowledge that more sophisticated testing – using advanced "blood vessel on a chip" systems that better mimic real physiology – will be needed to confirm these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are particularly significant because erythritol occupies a unique position in the sweetener landscape. Unlike artificial sweeteners such as aspartame or sucralose, erythritol is technically a sugar alcohol – a naturally occurring compound that the body produces in small amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This classification helped it avoid inclusion in recent &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/15-05-2023-who-advises-not-to-use-non-sugar-sweeteners-for-weight-control-in-newly-released-guideline"&gt;World Health Organization guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that discouraged the use of artificial sweeteners for weight control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol has also gained popularity among food manufacturers because it behaves more like sugar than other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sucralose is 320 times sweeter than sugar, erythritol provides only about 80% of sugar's sweetness, making it easier to use in recipes without creating an overpowering taste. It's now found in thousands of products, especially in many "sugar-free" and "keto-friendly" foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180493" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180493" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Eating-a-protein-bar-close-up-.jpg" alt="Woman eats a chocolate protein bar " class="size-full wp-image-180493" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Eating-a-protein-bar-close-up-.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Eating-a-protein-bar-close-up--600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180493" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Erythritol can be found in many keto-friendly products, such as protein bars. (Valeriia Sviridova/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Trade-off&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory agencies, including the European Food Standards Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration, have approved erythritol as safe for consumption. But the new research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that even "natural" sugar alternatives may carry unexpected health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-this-artificial-sweetener-may-cause-heart-damage?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Study Reveals How This Artificial Sweetener May Cause Heart Damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For consumers, the findings raise difficult questions about the trade-offs involved in sugar substitution. Sweeteners like erythritol can be valuable tools for weight management and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="180489" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; prevention, helping people reduce calories and control blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if regular consumption potentially weakens the brain's protective barriers and increases cardiovascular risk, the benefits may come at a significant cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research underscores a broader challenge in nutritional science: understanding the long-term effects of relatively new food additives that have become ubiquitous in the modern diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While erythritol may help people avoid the immediate harms of excess sugar consumption, its effect on the blood-brain barrier suggests that frequent use could be quietly compromising brain protection over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As scientists continue to investigate these concerning links, consumers may want to reconsider their relationship with this seemingly innocent sweetener – and perhaps question whether any sugar substitute additive is truly without risk.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261500/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

According to the National Institute of Health, adults require 7-9 hours of quality sleep every night for optimal rest and repair of the body in order to consolidate memory and regulate important hormones. Poor sleep is strongly associated with a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Eliopoulos emphasizes that quality sleep is not about how much you get, it is about consistency and creating a restorative environment. Dr. Vass suggests getting into a regular pattern of sleep, reducing exposure to blue light in the hours before bedtime, and making the bedroom quiet and dark. Improved sleep quality and experience had been associated with better cardiovascular health, improved immune status, and lower levels of systemic inflammation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigJBVV95cUxOeXpYcm5oMjlOT1J3Yjl3QXdqVTQzamFISTc1bGZHRktMOHN3MzlRbkFOb3U1SlVydzMzbFFCZUNfQWpNc1g4NXZTM3h4WXVYR19fNjJNT1FsRFFCREd6OGJHRkJGMVRFUzZDbVBnaTNIb0NFRld4MVY2WVFuYTgtVTJHNzJLaDU0Y1hTSjZMOVhCYU85eWNWWnozd0w2ZDJqcjllQVRHdUFfTEFmckx0MzNFVmdaTGRoUGh0XzVyZkpvUi1PMzM3OU05WW44LTByQlVYdDE4MjlWSFVRYTByYWtObUhCaHZpai1HMTE0N2ZSSXdsYlVBcVJ3VndYdmVBcGVmNFBCeC1CQdIBkgJBVV95cUxQckRYelktTmh0STBWRWY5ZTZkeXdzeGgwT3FvR1ZaS2lFU2RfV25uaTVSb21fcTBpaDJYMnhXM0VYZkdvel9qRl81YUJsUnFzUGJldWtVMGthMWFKVWZXb3pqVUg0b2daT2VoM0VKd2NIelh1Z29GdU5UM3hMangyX3BoN3RGc05kdktZeFJ5N09EelNQS19OOWc4SVZ6dlo1NmEzVFE1T3pDMXVHOC1WVmprM3lkUTM4VVVka2VmYVZxU05CWmJ3d1RDLWtuSFgyeXFtWkNjUzJYWWV3Z2Zfbjl5aTJ4dVB5dUZzNGxtV1JHRk5vZXpXSWNOMzlXTzd5VWdVdTBTLTkzNGxXU0lUc3hB</guid></item><item><title>一项研究质疑褪黑激素的使用和心脏健康，但不要因此而失眠-美联社新闻</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/melatonin-heart-failure-sleep-insomnia-155dab27c5d86976288fe30912105c7c</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="LeaderBoardAd-Mobile "&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — Don’t lose sleep over headlines linking melatonin to heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the message after some scary-sounding reports about a preliminary study involving the sleep-related supplement. It raised questions about the safety of long term use of melatonin for insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have long known that too little or interrupted sleep raises the risk of heart disease. But heart experts say this kind of so-called observational study can’t prove that melatonin use plays any role — instead of the insomnia patients were trying to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should not raise the alarm and tell patients to stop taking all their melatonin,” said Dr. Pratik Sandesara, an interventional cardiologist at Emory Healthcare who wasn’t involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our bodies naturally produce melatonin, a hormone that regulates our sleep cycles. Levels normally increase as it gets darker in the evening, triggering drowsiness. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;People may take lab-produced melatonin to help them fall asleep or to adjust for jet lag or time changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study used international electronic health records, tracking adults diagnosed with insomnia who had a melatonin prescription that suggested they used the supplement for at least a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over five years, 4.6% of the chronic melatonin users developed heart failure compared to 2.7% of insomnia patients whose charts showed no melatonin use, the researchers found. The study is being presented at an American Heart Association meeting but hasn’t undergone peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.

    &lt;div class="Infobox-items RichTextBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/be-well"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more Be Well.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But only certain countries require a melatonin prescription. It’s over-the-counter in the U.S., meaning Americans in the study might have used the supplements without it being recorded, said Northwestern University cardiology chief Dr. Clyde Yancy, who wasn’t involved in the study. The study also did not show dosages.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Also, U.S. supplements don’t require government approval, meaning brands can vary in their ingredients. The researchers, from SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, characterized the findings as a call for more research.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, patients wondering about melatonin should talk it over with their doctors, said Emory’s Sandesara. Generally doctors recommend it for short-term use, like for jet lag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yancy noted that while the study doesn’t prove there’s a danger from long term melatonin use, there’s also no evidence that people should use melatonin indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one key to better shut-eye is to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/sleep-stress-anxiety-caffeine-alcohol-35dfa5725a0fdefae0b18d5442e55cb3"&gt;practice better sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, like making sure your room is dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we expose ourselves to blue light in particular at night, we are diminishing our melatonin levels. That’s science,” he said. Sleep problems aren’t about “just being sleepy and tired — they’re putting yourself at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story has been corrected to show that the Northwestern University cardiology chief is Dr. Clyde Yancy, not Yancey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

At the same time, UnitedHealth Group, the country’s largest insurer, just &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-stock-rises-q3-earnings-165229050.html"&gt;beat Wall Street’s profit expectations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing isn’t coincidental. It’s the business model — since no matter what happens to the country’s health care safety net, insurers like UnitedHealth are poised to win. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurance companies have &lt;a href="https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/how-much-and-why-aca-marketplace-premiums-are-going-up-in-2026/"&gt;filed rate assumptions for both&lt;/a&gt; the extension and expiration scenarios, and under both options, they profit. Meanwhile, consumers face spiking premiums, soaring out-of-pocket costs, and debilitating uncertainty. What looks like political gridlock is, in fact, a strategic opportunity for the insurance industry.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers compared local burials, city life, and population patterns to what real epidemic-hit places look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale is not small. Four city cemeteries hold roughly 11,350 to 12,950 people, and hundreds of graves were examined in detail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those &lt;a href="https://www.amarnaproject.com/our-work/excavation-and-survey/south-tombs-cemetery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cemeteries&lt;/a&gt; were excavated between 2005 and 2022, giving a close look at how ordinary people were buried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-the-akhetaten-plague"&gt;Studying the Akhetaten plague&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead bioarchaeologist Gretchen R. Dabbs of Southern Illinois University Carbondale (&lt;a href="https://siu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SIU&lt;/a&gt;) co-authored the analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project pulls together burial data, settlement evidence, and population modeling from Akhetaten, better known today as Amarna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We conclude that when the evidence is considered as a whole, there is little to currently suggest Akhetaten was affected by a mortal epidemic,” wrote Dabbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team looked for classic crisis signs and did not find them. They saw ordinary burials, careful wrapping, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/etruscan-tomb-sealed-for-2600-years-reveals-more-than-100-intact-artifacts/"&gt;grave goods&lt;/a&gt; placed with care rather than rushed disposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texts from the wider region mention disease, including the Hittite “plague prayers” and several letters in the Amarna archive. Yet none point to a lethal plague outbreak inside Akhetaten itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new assessment weighs those writings against local ground truth. It keeps the texts in view but checks them against what the city’s archaeology actually shows on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-cemeteries-reveal"&gt;What the cemeteries reveal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most graves are single pit burials with textile shrouds and mat “coffins.” Bodies were not tossed in at random, and burial positions are typically orderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple burials do appear, especially in one northern cemetery, but who is buried with whom matters. Adult women are often interred with children, a pattern that looks intentional rather than emergency triage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that northern cemetery, a very high share of the dead are between about 5 and 25 years old. That is unusual for a normal town cemetery and suggests a restricted group rather than a cross-section of the whole city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A field photograph shows a triple burial from the North Tombs Cemetery, but context is key. The same area also records signs of heavy labor on the skeletons, pointing to a young workforce under strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-searching-for-akhetaten-plague"&gt;Searching for Akhetaten plague&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study leans on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-egypts-oldest-genome-reveals-surprising-ancestry-mix/"&gt;bioarchaeology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;the study of human remains from archaeological sites, to separate hard evidence from rumor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It checks for changes in how people were buried, and for cemetery clusters that would mark a sudden spike in deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also consider paleopathology&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;the study of disease in ancient bones, which rarely captures fast-moving infections. Many lethal microbes leave little or no trace on skeletons, especially if death follows quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/11/07130427/Akhetaten-plague_graveyard-excavation_skeleton_UChicago_1m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/11/07130433/Akhetaten-plague_graveyard-excavation_skeleton_UChicago_1s.webp" alt="An undisturbed burial at the North Tombs Cemetery containing three individuals (Inds. 1167, 1168, and 1169), who were wrapped together in a single burial mat before interment.

Where several people share one grave, the combinations are patterned, often linking women and children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pairing, repeated across sites, implies caregiving bonds at death. It reads like culture, not chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the cemeteries, people carry linear enamel hypoplasia, grooves in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tooth-enamel-analysis-suggests-early-eurasians-were-multiple-species-paranthropus-robustus/"&gt;tooth enamel&lt;/a&gt; from childhood stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also show spinal trauma and degenerative joint disease, long-term wear in joints from heavy use. These signals point to hard lives. They do not point to a runaway contagion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used paleodemography&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;estimating past population structures from burials, to check how many people should have died in a city this size over about two decades. The expected number and the observed number line up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That match matters. A true mass-mortality year would create a sharp bulge in the count, and the cemeteries do not show it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aftermath-of-an-epidemic"&gt;Aftermath of an epidemic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When epidemics really hammer a city, normal systems often crack. Burials get rushed, pits get bigger, buildings stall, and people leave without their things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akhetaten’s traces tell a different story. Burials were methodical, and city life shows remodeling and ongoing activity during the years the city was used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capital did not vanish overnight. It shrank as royal policy shifted after the Akhenaten plague, and some people stayed on for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That slow fade fits the archaeological record. It does not fit the picture of a city collapsing under a sudden fatal wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-closer-look-at-the-northern-cemetery"&gt;Closer look at the northern cemetery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One northern burial ground stands out for youth-heavy deaths and many shared graves. It likely served a workforce rather than the whole city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its skeletons show high workloads. Add stress and poor diet, and you get a dangerous mix without needing a single killer pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hittite prayers and diplomatic letters describe disease in the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bronze-age-people-abandoned-meat-for-millet-3500-years-ago/"&gt;Late Bronze Age&lt;/a&gt; world. They still matter, and they set the regional background. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, local context is king. At Akhetaten, the ground evidence does not confirm a lethal outbreak in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lessons-from-the-akhetaten-plague"&gt;Lessons from the Akhetaten plague&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists track taphonomy&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; the changes to remains after death, because disorder caused by decay can mimic careless burial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also think in terms of syndemic&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; linked health problems that worsen each other, which fits the city’s mix of work stress and undernutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those concepts help explain why hard lives can raise mortality without a single catastrophic disease event. They also explain why rumors of plague can linger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal deaths cluster in the historical record, and fearsome &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-egyptians-may-have-seen-their-goddess-in-the-milky-way/"&gt;deities of disease&lt;/a&gt; are prominent in art. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those threads are easy to knot into a single tidy tale. Repetition then hardens the guess into “fact.” The new work puts that story back on evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence from graves, bones, and city layers agrees. Akhetaten reads like a stressed but functioning city, not a community cut down by a lethal epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is a reminder to test big stories against local data. It shows how science rewrites old narratives without drama or hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/736705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Archaeology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 21:34:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxOWjgya1FWNm4wc0NGeEVzR1RqNFRzQWdTWXJJcjZSWlB4UlcxUkdZVHJZS0tWOVZ1S0FVSE5KemtkX3VrZlZUWFZVVXZZY1dHODRjemFnODE0dFFidzFfem9lQk0ybWxxeFhzUjdzbXVnY3Z0ZDdOdnpJWVo0VVcyUHRyZUpUXzdfRS16SXJ2VGd4Sm9kUk1jaXVLdk1SN1gteHpxblpMWV9sVmZG</guid></item></channel></rss>
