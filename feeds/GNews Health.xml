    &lt;p&gt;A baby died at three days old after NHS medics failed to wake his mother for observations while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sonny Taylor suffered catastrophic brain damage as a result of being starved of oxygen having been left “distressed for a significant amount of time”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Midwifery staff had left his mother Eve, 29, sleeping instead of waking her for observations and to listen to Sonny’s heart, an internal &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/nhs/"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; investigation report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The baby was then delivered in a “poor condition” via caesarean section at Ysbyty Gwynedd Hospital in Bangor, Wales. He died at three days old on Oct 3 2022 as a result of sepsis and a brain injury from oxygen starvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His parents have won an undisclosed settlement after suing the local health board. Speaking for the first time about her son’s death, Eve said: “When I went into hospital, I never could have imagined what was to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What followed was frantic, chaotic and terrifying. I went to sleep at my emergency C-section not knowing if I would wake up or whether my baby would make it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Mother sent to wrong ward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eve was admitted to Ysbyty Gwynedd Hospital on Sept 29, 2022 after her waters broke at 36 weeks pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sonny’s heart rate was initially diagnosed as normal, but later that afternoon signs of potential infection were identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 6pm Eve’s observations and Sonny’s heart rate and movements were classed as normal. At 10pm, as Eve was asleep, observations and monitoring were not carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She awoke at 1.30am on Sept 30 concerned about Sonny’s reduced movement, and a registrar was called. The registrar established that Sonny had an abnormal heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eve was wrongly transferred to the labour ward instead of being taken for delivery, arriving at 1.43am. A call for an emergency caesarean was made. There was then a 15-minute delay to Sonny’s birth, who was delivered at 2.03am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sonny was moved from a neonatal intensive care unit to palliative care, with the permission of Eve and her partner Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;NHS apologises for ‘failings’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas said that his son was “badly let down when he needed help the most”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His parents won the undisclosed settlement following legal action against the Betsi Cadwaladr University Local Health Board. Through NHS Wales, the board apologised for the “failings identified” within the investigation report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report found a midwife should have woken Eve and performed observations and listened to Sonny’s heart rate at 10pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sara Burns, a medical negligence lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, representing Eve, said: “While we’re pleased to have secured this settlement and appreciate the health board’s co-operation in resolving the case promptly, no amount of compensation can ever begin to make up for what the family has been through.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carol Shillabeer, the chief executive of Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said: “We would like to offer our sincere sympathies to the family of baby Sonny, who sadly died in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are deeply sorry for their loss and for the failures in care that occurred. We recognise the profound impact this has had on Sonny’s family, and we apologise unreservedly for the distress caused.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World-renowned biohacker Bryan Johnson is raising eyebrows for his &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/28/health/bryan-johnson-credits-shockwave-therapy-and-botox-for-titanic-erections/"&gt;shocking approach&lt;/a&gt; to erectile health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Johnson — whose mantra is, “Don’t Die” — takes Cialis, receives penile Botox and even undergoes low-intensity shockwave therapy to his, uh, johnson to improve blood flow, enhance erections and achieve sexual performance comparable to a teenager’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Nighttime erections are, like, a really important health marker,” Johnson, 48, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qriveAV7BY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said in 2024&lt;/a&gt;. “Men who do not have nighttime erections are 70% more likely to die prematurely. It predicts death.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Biohacker Bryan Johnson is a big proponent of penile health as a key marker of biological age. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;YouTube/, The Diary Of A CEO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not the only longevity-seeker making waves with his rigid regimen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fitness guru Ben Greenfield, 44, has experimented with &lt;a href="https://bengreenfieldlife.com/article/biohacking-articles/the-most-potent-natural-alternative-to-viagra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;acoustic wave therapy&lt;/a&gt; and, stunningly, &lt;a href="https://bengreenfieldlife.com/article/get-effects-stem-cell-dick-injectionwithout-actually-getting-stem-cell-dick-injection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stem cell injections&lt;/a&gt; to optimize sexual performance and vitality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So is penile health a true barometer of longevity? Are these biohackers playing the long game &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; or overextending themselves for a pipe dream?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Post spoke with two experts about the rising interest in biohacking the penis — they shared their tip-down philosophies for protecting the crown jewels for the decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How does penile health reflect overall health?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Penis health is &lt;a href="https://www.browardurologycenter.com/pdf/International-Index-of-Erectile-Function-IIEF-Questionnaire.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;measured in many ways&lt;/a&gt;, [namely] erectile dysfunction (ED), orgasmic function, libido, satisfaction with intercourse and overall satisfaction,” &lt;a href="https://ryanweltermd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Ryan Welter&lt;/a&gt;, a pioneer in regenerative cellular therapy and founder of &lt;a href="https://regenerismedical.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Regeneris Medical&lt;/a&gt;, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Declines in penile health — particularly ED — have been established as an early predictor of cardiovascular disease, often appearing two to five years before a heart attack, Welter added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Penile arteries are significantly smaller than the arteries that supply the heart and brain, meaning they often show the first signs of plaque buildup.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;High cholesterol and plaque buildup reduce the blood flow needed for an erection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Penile arteries are significantly smaller than the arteries that supply the heart and brain, meaning they often show the first signs of plaque buildup. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;creativebubble – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nerve damage is also a major reason for ED because it affects signals from the brain to the pelvis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nerve degeneration is common with age — it’s also a hallmark of diabetes, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, Parkinson’s disease, stroke and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And finally, imbalances in sex hormones can pave the way for ED. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/12/health/the-truth-about-manopause-and-slow-insidious-signs-men-overlook/"&gt;Low testosterone&lt;/a&gt; reduces libido and the ability to get and maintain erections.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Furthermore, and this is important, happiness is one of the best predictors of longevity,” Welter said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sexual dysfunction and depressed sexual satisfaction are indicators of unhappiness and need to be treated if longevity is the goal.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are the red flags of poor erectile health?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Typically, men, over time, will experience erections that are not as firm as they used to be, difficulty maintaining the erection over time [and] changes in nocturnal and morning erections,” aesthetic nurse practitioner &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/injectorchris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Chris Bustamante&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the NYC men’s clinic &lt;a href="https://www.lushfulaesthetics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lushful Aesthetics&lt;/a&gt;, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It might take them longer to ejaculate or [they] may ejaculate faster. Typically, longer is more normal with age.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sudden, drastic changes to the quality, frequency and duration of erections — especially when accompanied by symptoms like rapid weight gain, shortness of breath or fatigue — should warrant an urgent visit to the doctor, who will evaluate the cardiovascular system, hormone levels and the presence of any tumors, Bustamante said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why it’s important to track morning and nocturnal erections and their general hardness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Semen is not as good of a biomarker as erections, some experts say. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;RHJ – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For his part, Johnson uses an &lt;a href="https://www.talktoadam.com/products/adam-sensor" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Adam Health sensor&lt;/a&gt; ($249) to measure his nighttime erections, garnering data on their duration, frequency and quality to generate an erection health score.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said he also tracks his sperm count, movement and shape, penile blood flow, urination speed and prostate size.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Bustamante said erections are stronger benchmarks than semen characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is just kind of normal sometimes for [the] volume of semen to decline with age,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It also varies a lot from man to man, already from the beginning. So some men naturally have higher volume loads of semen versus others.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are the common treatments for ED?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The single most important treatment for longevity and health span, particularly for the penis, is diet and exercise and maintaining good metabolic health,” Welter said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a hard-and-fast rule, Bustamante said, you need to focus on consuming fruits, vegetables and fiber and limit red meat for its saturated fat content and processed foods for their trans fats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Red meat and processed foods can raise blood pressure because of their high levels of sodium, saturated fats and preservatives. High blood pressure causes ED by damaging and narrowing blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Strength training is critical for penile health because it enhances blood flow, boosts testosterone and improves vascular function. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Chanakon – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In terms of exercise, Bustamante said it’s important to build muscle since “muscle is the organ of longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He recommends 30 minutes of daily cardio, but warns against one popular activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We do see a higher correlation of ED when it comes to cyclists,” Bustamante said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter if you have a special, fancy seat or not,” he added. “Putting all that pressure on your perineum (the skin and tissue between your genitals and your anus) does sort of damage these nerves and vessels over time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes aside, Bustamante said low doses of Cialis relax smooth muscles in the prostate, bladder neck and penis to boost urine flow and facilitate erections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What about those expensive biohacker tools?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Over time, men’s penises become desensitized — part of that is through sex and masturbation, and part of it is just through general aging,” Bustamante said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Helping to resensitize that tissue is a really important factor in terms of overall performance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why some biohackers are going so far as to embrace low-intensity focused shockwave devices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bustamante said these gizmos emit sound waves that cause micro-injuries in penile tissue, triggering the growth of new blood vessels and increased blood circulation to improve penile sensitivity and function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shockwave therapy and acoustic wave therapy are often used interchangeably, so it’s important to know what you’re really getting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This is an example of a shockwave device. Thankfully, it’s being used on a person’s shin in this picture. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;puhimec – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In general, shockwave therapy uses intense, high-energy acoustic waves, while acoustic therapy often refers to gentler, lower-intensity waves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is not going to be strong enough to actually penetrate the depth of this tissue,” Bustamante said of acoustic wave therapy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s going to be very, very superficial, and so, therefore, it just really is not impactful.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For its part, Botox temporarily relaxes muscles by blocking nerve signals that cause muscle contraction.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Bustamante said that when it’s injected into the penis, patients tend to notice they can achieve firmer, quicker erections. But Botox typically lasts only three to four months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This treatment is really great to just improve someone’s quality of life when it comes to erectile function,” Bustamante said, adding that it can enhance the effectiveness of Cialis and Viagra.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;As for penile stem cell injections, this treatment has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s considered experimental, with no strong evidence of safety or effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bustamante also warns against the increasingly popular practice of injecting salmon sperm derivatives into the penile area, as it can cause infections, allergic reactions and probably some funky smells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, he recommends and administers &lt;a href="https://www.lushfulaesthetics.com/sexual-enhancement-services/p-shot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“P-shots,”&lt;/a&gt; injections of platelet-rich plasma from the patient’s own blood into the penis to boost blood flow and stimulate tissue repair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These modalities, such as shockwave and P-shot, are really beneficial in terms of people experiencing better sex lives,” Bustamante said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Worth a shot — or a shock — to get up and running?&lt;/p&gt;

My uncle found me a couple of days later, having driven around town constantly looking for me the moment he heard about what had happened. He was a total wild man, but he put a roof over my head when nobody else would, gave me unconditional love, and helped me find my way. He helped me get into college, and he paid for it.&lt;/p&gt;

    


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkr20hll001j3b79rg4h94rn@published"&gt;When he died, he left a void in my life. He also left me the house I grew up in, a large amount of money, and a successful business. Suddenly, my parents and my brothers, whom I’ve not spoken to in nearly two decades, are “reaching out.” It’s heartbreaking because I’ve always wanted my family back, but I am not stupid enough to believe that they have any interest in me. Is there a pathway for reconciliation here? Or am I just kidding myself? Am I a fool for wanting these people in my life? Or to even believe that could happen on my terms?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="170" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkr1rhto00143b79j715nq3z@published"&gt;You are not a fool at all for missing your family and wanting them in your life. It also doesn’t make you “stupid” to believe that they would miss you, too. Many families struggle with what to do when loved ones are doing drugs and juggle two options: getting them support or giving them so-called “tough love.” It seems your parents might have thought the latter was the right thing to do. We can guess at their flawed rationale, but this doesn’t negate your feelings. They abandoned you when you were a child, and it will feel like abandonment, no matter what their intent might have been. But if you truly want to reconcile, and if you feel emotionally ready, you can always have an initial conversation. That second caveat is &lt;em&gt;crucial&lt;/em&gt; for you think about here. You’re already in a vulnerable place with the death of your uncle. You might want to consult a therapist on your own to discuss if you’re truly ready to handle seeing them again.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkr1rhvp00153b79hdmh40kw@published"&gt;If you do decide to see them, I would first think of a neutral place you can meet where you feel comfortable. Is there a coffee shop or a park you go to often? Maybe you all can grab a smoothie and walk around your neighborhood if the weather’s nice. I find that it’s easier for me to have tough conversations on walks because I can look elsewhere when I need to. A good family therapist could help you all confront these old feelings together and start a fresh, new relationship on better terms. But know you can always put space between yourself and them again if you need to. None of this is binding, and you’re allowed to change your mind and follow what feels right.&lt;/p&gt;

That risk significantly increased with consistent heavy consumption, whereas those who quit drinking may have demonstrated decreased risk of precancerous tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“The longer someone drinks, the longer their colon and rectum are exposed damage and impaired repair, both major mechanisms of cancer,” Dr. Lynn M O’Connor, section chief of colon and rectal surgery at Mercy Medical Center and St. Joseph Hospital in New York, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study followed more than 88,000 adults with no prior history of cancer. Participants reported their alcohol use beginning in early adulthood and were followed for nearly a decade to track cancer outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Compared with those who averaged one drink or less per week over their lifetime, those who consumed over 14 drinks a week had a 25% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. The link was even stronger for rectal cancer, where one's risk nearly doubled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Rectal cancer is “often more difficult to treat and more involved clinically, which makes screening and early identification all the more important,” Dr. Jeffrey Farma, a colorectal cancer specialist, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The results come as colorectal cancers are on the rise, especially in younger people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“We’re seeing an uptick in rectal cancers. If alcohol affects the lower part of the colon differently —we need to understand why,” Dr. Fola May, a GI specialist and associate director of the UCLA Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Equity, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the study, researchers found the highest risks among people who drank heavily at every stage of life. Those who consistently exceeded recommended drinking limits across each stage of adulthood had a 91% higher risk of colorectal cancer compared with lifelong light drinkers or those with gaps in heavy drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“These numbers are not guarantees, but signals to do something before it’s too late,” May said. “Colorectal cancer is one of the few cancers we can actually prevent or catch early, but fewer than 70% of eligible people get screened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study also looked at adenomas —polyps that can develop into cancer. While heavy drinking was not strongly linked to adenoma risk, those who quit drinking had significantly lower odds of developing nonadvanced adenomas compared to light drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“These are modifiable risks. The choices people make over time matter, and the body can respond when those risks are reduced,” Farma said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The results align with a growing body of evidence linking alcohol, a well-recognized carcinogen, to colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Colorectal screening is recommended for all adults starting at age 45 according to the United States Preventative Services Task Force. Screening tools include annual stool tests, CT scans every five years, or colonoscopies every 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Everyone should be screened. It saves lives, and people are dying unnecessarily when they put it off,” May said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Those who may be at higher risk may need to be screened at an early age or more often than typically recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“If you’ve had prolonged heavy drinking and you develop symptoms like bleeding or persistent changes in bowel habits, you need to be evaluated — even in your 30s,” Farma said. “That’s how we catch this early and save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt; Tyler Beauchamp, MD, is a pediatric resident at UNC Children’s Hospital and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 08:13:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNMzdpOFc0eV9Ja0tPYkZZVXRsVVRhajlIYWhTQUNqRDktNDAxaG5QNk9GeXNtQW5kTmhmeUwzOW1VOF84Tzg5bm95VER6MC1KNWhGN2ROaElWQUpTVGZrVUt6a1JFX0JFOEVOdk1vVk9MXzRvNVU4cWFnRlR1dFk3dnRrblJrYUd0UE1YeTZGa2pXUkczdFkzU1pHZnFGMDQ3SFA3N0pjLUJNZ9IBrwFBVV95cUxNd3VDMG52b2lLTkJBWDZtbVFna1BUVWVLanZnU1hhZzUxMWIxTGZoVUluMHFUYUxXWXJSMVRhX3NRWEdzTXVoLWM0NmVqSU5tSGlac1c0NENhUVdfNHZHYUdmelVHbnRMWVJSVXVqUjV3S2NnWDFHLWlfQzBGd3R1clM3bFdCVnlpa1JqTFk0Z2RZbW43WFVDYlo5Y2NjNFlhZzdFelQ3QXZ2UEZGR2VJ</guid></item><item><title>“肌肉老化对渐进式力量训练的反应非常好” —一位私人教练分享了一项5步锻炼，以在65岁后锻炼肌肉-汤姆指南</title><link>https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/aging-muscles-respond-very-well-to-progressive-strength-training-a-personal-trainer-shares-a-5-move-workout-to-build-muscle-after-65</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;

&lt;p id="1b781d73-6b42-4188-909e-914b57f4e127"&gt;Building muscle does tend to get harder with age, but that doesn't mean it stops being possible. These changes can affect people at different ages and at different rates, and when they do, it doesn't mean your fitness is suddenly on a downhill slope, or that rebuilding strength is an uphill battle you can't win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to physiotherapist and personal trainer Grace Heinrichs, currently working at&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xclubs.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://www.xclubs.co.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt; X-Club Pilates &amp;amp; Wellness&lt;/a&gt; in London, these shifts are a normal part of the aging process rather than a sign that you’ve left it too late. “There is good news in all of this, aging muscles respond very well to progressive strength training,” she says, particularly when training is approached with patience and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="1b781d73-6b42-4188-909e-914b57f4e127-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Progressive strength training, also known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/progressive-overload-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-help-build-muscle-and-strength" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/progressive-overload-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-help-build-muscle-and-strength"&gt;progressive overload&lt;/a&gt;, simply means gradually increasing the challenge placed on your muscles over time.

    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, exactly what you eat and when should be tailored to your routine. Here are their recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to approach breakfast if...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;You’re an early riser&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Kinross’s advice is simple: if you wake at 6am naturally, try to eat between 6.30 and 7.30am – and definitely before 8am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope mostly agrees: if you’re trying to stay full with a long day ahead, “it can be helpful to wait for about an hour, maybe an hour and a half” before you eat, to keep you going until lunch and make sure you’ve fully digested last night’s meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;You struggle with mornings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should you not feel alert when you wake up, it’s tempting to reach for a big mug of coffee to help you get out the door, but Hope advises against this as doing so “can cause a big spike of cortisol, making you feel much more stressed”. Eating first slows the release of caffeine into your system, helping you to feel alert for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar is best avoided entirely. If you wake up groggy, a savoury breakfast will make sure you don’t crash later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;You wake up ravenous&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Well done – it means you’ve likely fasted correctly and your circadian rhythm is in sync with your gut,” Dr Kinross says. Just bear in mind Hope’s advice that breakfast should make up about a fifth of your daily calorie intake, to leave room for two more square meals and some healthy snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aim to eat by satisfying your hunger without spiking your glucose,” Dr Kinross says, as “despite the urge to eat everything in sight, you need stable energy throughout the day”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;You don’t feel hungry until the afternoon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you consume any food, your body releases the hormone insulin to tackle it. The release of insulin can affect the release of other hormones in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So even if you don’t feel hungry, it’s best to eat something, even if small, particularly if you’re a woman, as “having something to eat soon after you wake is crucial to keeping the hormonal system stable”, Hope says. A handful of nuts and a few berries will do. “Never eat anything that comes in a bar form and don’t believe anyone who tells you that you can drink your breakfast,” adds Dr Kinross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;You exercise before work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re planning to do cardiovascular exercise early in the morning, it’s wise to eat something relatively light but high in carbohydrates before you do, to fuel your body. Wong recommends “a banana and some peanut butter or a square of dark chocolate before your workout, followed by your full breakfast afterwards”.&lt;/p&gt;

But it isn’t. It’s a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver, and over time, it can mess up one of the hardest-working organs in your body. What’s worrying is how fast it’s spreading in India, and how little we talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade or two ago, fatty liver was mostly linked to heavy drinking. That’s changed. Today, the bigger driver is lifestyle. Long work hours, sitting too much, food that’s quick but not great, and stress that never really switches off. And yes, alcohol still plays a role, but a large chunk of cases now fall under non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fatty liver: What are the symptoms, risk factors? How to manage it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fatty liver disease, now officially termed Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease or MASLD, occurs when fat accumulates in more than 5% of liver cells in the absence of significant alcohol consumption," says Dr. Gagandeep Singh, MBBS, Founder – Redial Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is seeing a strange mix right now. On one hand, rising incomes and urban living. On the other, less physical movement and diets packed with refined carbs, sugar, and ultra-processed snacks. So even people who don’t “look unhealthy” can have fatty liver. Thin outside, fat inside, as doctors sometimes say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The condition has reached epidemic proportions in India. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta-analyses estimate that approximately one in three Indian adults now has fatty liver, a pooled prevalence of around 38.6%. In urban populations and high-risk groups such as those with diabetes or obesity, this figure exceeds 50%," says Dr Gagandeep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So why don’t we hear about it more?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that fatty liver is sneaky. In the early stages, it usually doesn’t hurt. No pain, no obvious symptoms, nothing dramatic enough to send someone to a doctor. Maybe some tiredness, a bit of discomfort. Easy to ignore. And because routine health checkups in India don’t always include liver imaging, many cases slip through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a mindset issue. Liver disease, for many people, still equals alcohol. So if someone doesn’t drink much, they assume their liver must be fine. Doctors do try to explain otherwise, but public awareness campaigns haven’t really caught up yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there’s stigma. Talking about liver problems can feel awkward, like it automatically puts you in the “bad habits” box. So people avoid the conversation altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to clear confusion around fatty liver, Dr Gagandeep has answered a few common queries around the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do many people with fatty liver have no symptoms at all?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Gagandeep Singh:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The liver is remarkably stoic. It has no pain receptors within its tissue, and it possesses extraordinary functional reserve, you can lose significant liver function before any symptoms appear. This is precisely what makes fatty liver so dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early stages, simple steatosis, the liver compensates. Patients feel entirely normal. There's no pain, no jaundice, no obvious warning signs. Even standard liver enzymes like ALT and AST can remain within normal ranges despite substantial fat accumulation. Studies show that liver enzymes may be normal in a significant proportion of individuals even when there is considerable hepatic fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time symptoms emerge, fatigue, right upper abdominal discomfort, unexplained weight loss, the disease has often progressed to inflammation (steatohepatitis) or even early fibrosis. The liver has been silently accumulating damage for years, sometimes decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why I tell patients: the absence of symptoms is not the absence of disease. Fatty liver is diagnosed by looking, not by feeling. Without proactive screening in at-risk individuals, we're catching this condition far too late in its natural history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is most at risk for fatty liver disease, even if they don't drink alcohol?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Gagandeep Singh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious candidates are individuals with obesity, Type 2 diabetes, or metabolic syndrome. But here's what catches many patients and even physicians off-guard: lean individuals can absolutely develop fatty liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research consistently shows that fatty liver occurs in individuals who are not obese, particularly in Asian populations. In India, studies have found that a substantial proportion of NAFLD patients have BMI below 25. The critical driver isn't total body weight, it's where the fat accumulates. Visceral adiposity, fat around the organs, matters far more than subcutaneous fat. An individual with a normal BMI but increased waist circumference and insulin resistance is at significant risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond metabolic factors, consider these high-risk groups: individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), those with a family history of diabetes or fatty liver, people with sleep apnoea, and those with sedentary occupations. The IT sector workforce deserves special mention, recent research from Hyderabad found alarming MAFLD prevalence among IT employees, driven by prolonged sitting, irregular meal patterns, and high stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age matters too, risk increases with age, though we're now seeing fatty liver in children and young adults, particularly those with childhood obesity. If you have central obesity, insulin resistance, or prediabetes, you should be screened regardless of your overall weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should be screened? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Gagandeep Singh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with Type 2 diabetes, obesity (especially central obesity), metabolic syndrome, PCOS, or persistently elevated liver enzymes. I wouldalso recommend screening for individuals with a strong family history of diabetes or liver disease, those with sleep apnoea, and anyone with unexplained fatigue alongside metabolic risk factors. Given the high prevalence in India, a case can be made for screening all adults over 40 with even one metabolic risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What common diet habits silently worsen fatty liver?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Gagandeep Singh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several dietary patterns drive hepatic fat accumulation, often without patients realising the connection:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juices: These are perhaps the single worst offenders. Fructose, whether from table sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, or "natural" fruit juices, is metabolised almost exclusively by the liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refined carbohydrates: White rice, maida-based products, processed snacks, these spike insulin levels repeatedly throughout the day, promoting fat storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods: Beyond their refined carbohydrate content, these contain emulsifiers, preservatives, and industrial seed oils that may disrupt gut barrier function and promote inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sedentary lifestyle: This worsens body composition with more visceral fat and less muscle mass, and subsequently deranging overall metabolic profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inadequate protein: Without sufficient protein (I recommend 25-30 grams per meal), the body cannot maintain muscle mass. Sarcopenia, muscle loss, actually worsens fatty liver by reducing the body's capacity to handle glucose and triglycerides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are liver detox drinks and supplements actually helpful or harmful?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Gagandeep Singh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me be direct: liver detox products are, at best, a waste of money. At worst, they can cause the very liver damage they claim to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver doesn't need external "detoxification". It processes toxins, medications, and metabolic waste continuously, 24 hours a day. The concept that toxins "accumulate" in the liver and require special juices or supplements to flush out has no proof in biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Johns Hopkins hepatologists, there are no clinical data supporting the efficacy of liver cleanses. More concerning, dietary supplements are increasingly recognised as a cause of drug-induced liver injury. Research from the Acute Liver Failure Study Group found that herbal-dietary supplements accounted for 16% of severe drug-induced liver injury cases requiring hospitalisation (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1542356525009425" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;DOI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="103"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific concerns include green tea extract in concentrated supplement form (associated with hepatotoxicity at high doses), turmeric supplements containing piperine (case reports of significant liver injury exist — &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/405932-drug-induced-liver-injury-secondary-to-turmeric-supplement-containing-piperine-a-case-report" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;DOI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;), and various proprietary "liver cleanse" formulations with undisclosed ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="107"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to support your liver, skip the supplements and focus on what actually works: dietary modification, exercise, weight management, and alcohol moderation. Your liver doesn't need a detox, it needs you to stop overwhelming it with excess calories and processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="111"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="112"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the top lifestyle changes you recommend to protect liver health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Gagandeep Singh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;I approach liver health through what I call coordinated metabolic rehabilitation — addressing root causes rather than symptoms. Here are the interventions with the strongest evidence:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="115"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="116"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time-restricted eating: After twelve years of practising intermittent fasting myself and implementing it with hundreds of patients, I've found that 14-16 hour fasting windows improve insulin sensitivity more reliably than calorie counting alone. During fasting, insulin levels drop, allowing the liver to shift from fat storage to fat oxidation. The key is consistency — pick an eating window that fits your lifestyle and maintain it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Body recomposition, not just weight loss: I've stopped telling patients to simply "lose weight." The goal is losing fat while preserving or building muscle. Crash diets that sacrifice muscle for quick weight loss actually worsen long-term metabolic health. A 10-15% reduction in body weight, achieved gradually with adequate protein intake, produces more durable improvements than aggressive restriction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resistance training: This is non-negotiable. According to PubMed research, resistance training is effective in reducing risk factors for metabolic syndrome and fatty liver by optimizing muscle and liver function (&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-88361-3_26" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;DOI&lt;/a&gt;). Aim for two to three sessions weekly, focusing on major muscle groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein prioritisation: Every meal should contain adequate protein — 25-30 grams. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eliminate sugar-sweetened beverages: Replace sodas, packaged juices, and sweetened chai with water, black coffee, or unsweetened tea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coordinated care: A physician adjusting medications and monitoring progress, a nutritionist customising meal plans within cultural preferences, and a fitness professional building sustainable exercise habits, this triangle of care succeeds where isolated dietary advice fails. Patients aren't lacking motivation; they're lacking a system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="117"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence is clear: fatty liver is not a life sentence. With early intervention and sustained lifestyle modification, reversal is achievable for many patients. But reversal requires action — and that action needs to start before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="121"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Medical experts consulted &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="123"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="124"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="125"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article includes expert inputs shared with TOI Health by: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="127"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gagandeep Singh, MBBS, Founder – Redial Clinic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="129"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inputs were used to explain why fatty liver is not being talked about enough despite being a silently growing crisis in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>根除天花的领导者William Foege博士去世- ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/dr-william-foege-leader-smallpox-eradication-dies-129543666</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;ATLANTA -- &lt;/span&gt;Dr. William Foege, a leader of one of humanity's greatest public health victories — the global eradication of smallpox — has died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Foege died Saturday in Atlanta at the age of 89, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.taskforce.org/bill-foege-tribute/"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the Task Force for Global Health, which he co-founded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The 6-foot-7 inch Foege literally stood out in the field of public health. A whip-smart medical doctor with a calm demeanor, he had a canny knack for beating back infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He was director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and later held other key leadership roles in campaigns against international health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But his greatest achievement came before all that, with his work on smallpox, one of the most lethal diseases in human history. For centuries, it killed about one-third of the people it infected and left most survivors with deep scars on their faces from the pus-filled lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Smallpox vaccination campaigns were well established by the time Foege was a young doctor. Indeed, it was no longer seen in the United States. But infections were still occurring elsewhere, and efforts to stamp them out were stalling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Working as a medical missionary in Nigeria in the 1960s, Foege and his colleagues developed a "ring containment" strategy, in which a smallpox outbreak was contained by identifying each smallpox case and vaccinating everyone who the patients might come into contact with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The method relied heavily on quick detective work and was born out of necessity. There simply wasn't enough vaccine available to immunize everyone, Foege wrote in "House on Fire," his 2011 book about the smallpox eradication effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It worked, and became pivotal in helping rid the world of smallpox for good. The last naturally occurring case was seen in Somalia in 1977. In 1980, the World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated from the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If you look at the simple metric of who has saved the most lives, he is right up there with the pantheon. Smallpox eradication has prevented hundreds of millions of deaths," said former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden, who consulted with Foege regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Foege was born March 12, 1936. His father was a Lutheran minister, but he became interested in medicine at 13 while working at a drugstore in Colville, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He got his medical degree from the University of Washington in 1961 and a master's in public health from Harvard in 1965.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He was director of the Atlanta-based CDC from 1977 to 1983, then held other international public health leadership roles, including stints as executive director at The Carter Center and senior fellow at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In 2012, President Barack Obama presented Foege with the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. In 2016, while awarding Foege an honorary degree, Duke University President President Richard Brodhead called him "the Father of Global Health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Bill Foege had an unflagging commitment to improving the health of people across the world, through powerful, purpose-driven coalitions applying the best science available,” Task Force for Global Health CEO Dr. Patrick O’Carroll said in a statement.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrffriy000x26p77v68f0xs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday released its updated recommendations for what vaccines children should get. It’s a routine revision, hardly different from last year’s recommendations, but it carries more significance this year: More states and doctors are relying on it instead of a controversial new schedule from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrpy4bv00033b6s31z7ozt1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The AAP’s newest recommendations include a new immunization against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and a few other minor adjustments — a stark difference from the sweeping changes abruptly made to the CDC vaccine schedule this month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmksq9pwd00013b6sp58ql1sw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the CDC schedule has long been the default guide to vaccination across the country, many doctors say they’re now choosing the AAP’s guidelines instead.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r70006336po0aq7tw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The science hasn’t changed,” said Dr. Claudia Hoyen, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and director of pediatric innovation at UH Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland. “We will continue to follow the science.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r70003336pd2qqmt53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The AAP continues to broadly recommend routine immunization against RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, flu and meningococcal disease. Twelve major medical and health care organizations have formally endorsed its recommendations, including the American Medical Association, the National Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkst331000043b6swrnvdk62@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In contrast, the updated CDC schedule narrowed recommendations for protection against meningococcal disease, hepatitis B and hepatitis A to children who are at higher risk for infections. It also recommends that choices on vaccinations against flu, Covid-19 and rotavirus be based on “shared clinical decision-making,” which means people who want one must consult with a health care provider.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkslzh9l00003b6s6nq03rvw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent,” US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said after the vaccine schedule update. “This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrgx0330003336pq4kt2xtr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were no safety issues or new research to suggest that the vaccines on the CDC’s previous schedule weren’t necessary.

            “For now, unfortunately, we have to ignore everything about vaccines that is coming from our federal government,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the AAP’s Committee on Infectious Diseases. “Parents should trust their pediatrician, trust the professional societies like the American Academy of Pediatrics.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r70005336pku0unz2c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The half-dozen pediatricians who spoke with CNN they said they’ll stick with the AAP’s guidance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Dr. Sarah Elizabeth DeRoo, a pediatrician at Children’s National in Washington, DC, says that she will continue to share “very candidly” with families about vaccines and that “we know they’re safe and effective.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmksvg0fn000b3b6sm35p9dwi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the CDC’s vaccine schedule changed this month, she said, it undermined some parents’ confidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r70008336p76t2jpzt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have families that come into our clinic that traditionally have been very accepting of vaccines and they want to know, ‘is this new recommendation, is this evidence-based, or do I need to think differently about these vaccines’ that they’ve accepted previously?” DeRoo said. “We’ve been giving messaging to our patients that we’re continuing to follow the recommended schedule by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which is an evidence- based schedule.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrso6q1000a3b6scfhomac4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The disconnect between advice from the CDC and from doctors has confused and even scared some parents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r70002336pj5zbjyga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are seeing the vaccine conversation come up more and more frequently because of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fear of this and general misinformation spreading online,” said Dr. Nina Alfieri, Continuity Clinic director with Lurie Children’s Pediatrics at Uptown in Chicago. “We always want families to feel welcome coming to clinic with their questions.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r70009336p6xgky1u9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at NYU, said he gets why parents are asking more questions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmksv4zcv00053b6sgnhd6yrb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve had so many years of the CDC being a reliable source of information,” he said. “It’s understandable why families are confused.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000a336phoe299i5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Historically, states have followed CDC recommendations, but most say they will now follow AAP recommendations instead, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/state-recommendations-for-routine-childhood-vaccines-increasing-departure-from-federal-guidelines/" target="_blank"&gt;according to KFF&lt;/a&gt;, a health policy organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000b336p9inc8k93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As of January 20, KFF found, 28 states were giving advice that deviates from federal guidelines for some or all childhood vaccines. Although it’s not clear how states will handle vaccine requirements for schools, what is clear is that there is a real blue/red divide on which vaccine advice to follow, according to Jen Kates, a co-author of the analysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000c336prcu8ic9f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All states with Democratic governors have announced that they won’t follow federal guidelines. Only four states led by Republicans have done the same.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000d336phnzmyi44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For the first time in our country, we’re going to have really varying laws, policies and attitudes about vaccines based on where people live,” Kates said. “It’s a major sea change in public health policy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000e336p8ops78zy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hoyen&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; of UH Rainbow Babies and Children’s, has been practicing medicine for 30 years and said she doesn’t want to go back to the pre-vaccine days. She remembers a colleague&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;who was deaf in one ear because of a childhood case of mumps and another in the same class who was deaf in one ear because of meningitis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmksv7ut000073b6saolln0i0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Meningitis was so common before the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine came into use in 1987, she remembers, that pediatricians routinely kept spinal tap equipment on hand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000f336p5xbeqzs5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’d do the taps in the office, give them a dose of penicillin or whatever and send them straight to the hospital,” Hoyen said. “There’s a reason why these vaccines were created. It’s to help kids thrive and not to have to worry about complications from these childhood illnesses.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000g336pcgyyhilg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            O’Leary also doesn’t want to go back to the pre-vaccine era. He trained to be a doctor in the 1990s, before there was a vaccine against rotavirus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmksvae9f00093b6s9ub0ul28@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We had three seasons. In the winter, we had influenza season, we had RSV season, and we had rotavirus season. Heaven forbid if they all hit at the same time, because we’d be overwhelmed. Now, we don’t have a rotavirus season, and we’re seeing a very big impact on RSV season with the new product,” O’Leary said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000h336pdv9s6b5c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            DeRoo, who has only been caring for children during what she called “the vaccine era,” says she’s been trying to refresh her knowledge of what vaccine-preventable diseases look like.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkstb4lj000c3b6s72fb2fl4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have to rethink how we’re approaching people who walk in and are sick in the clinic, to make sure that we take all the appropriate precautions in the event that they may not be fully immunized,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000i336p36h6kzak@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ratner said a measles outbreak in New York a few years ago was the first time many of his colleagues had ever seen a case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkstbn7b000e3b6ss4msiw9e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think, given the way that things are going in this country, that is likely to change,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000j336p1qe5s2w1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The idea of going backwards is horrifying because you don’t want to lose hard-won progress, but also because we’re not talking about something abstract,” Ratner said. “We’re talking about actual children and families.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Isaac was running a fever, but it was a mild one. Antoine gave him paracetamol (acetaminophen) and soon Isaac fell back asleep, seemingly at peace in his fuzzy sleep sack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antoine headed back to bed, hoping to get a little more rest before daybreak. But soon Isaac was up again, because the fever wasn’t going away. Claire Fauvet—Antoine’s partner and Isaac’s mother—had to take an early train to Strasbourg for work, so Antoine bundled up the baby for a short walk to a nearby medical clinic. Father and son arrived right as the doors opened at 8 a.m. and Antoine had no reason to think Isaac had anything more than a routine illness—until staff called an ambulance, for speedy transfer to the university children’s hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why, a panicked Antoine wanted to know. Because, a doctor told him, Isaac might have meningococcal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/infectious-disease/meningococcal/" rel&gt;Meningococcal disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is the ultimate nightmare for pediatricians, and for parents who know about it. It is caused by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a bacterium that can invade the bloodstream, the spinal cord, or both. It is spread through close contact with respiratory or oral secretions, colonizing nasal and throat linings. Many people carry it harmlessly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But in rare cases it transforms into invasive disease, striking even healthy people with shocking speed. In a matter of hours, what seems like a routine, flu-like illness transforms into a full-body emergency of shock, blood clotting, and swelling of the brain. Between &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pinkbook/hcp/table-of-contents/chapter-14-meningococcal-disease.html" rel&gt;10 and 15 percent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of those who get meningococcal disease will die, even with rapid treatment. Many more will suffer permanent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.meningitis.org/meningitis-in-your-words-home/?types-of-meningitis=132&amp;amp;location-during-illness=&amp;amp;age-at-time-of-illness=&amp;amp;outcome-of-illness=&amp;amp;person-type=&amp;amp;after-effect=&amp;amp;search=1" rel&gt;physical or cognitive impairments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!d82c!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa65e03b6-062c-419e-9173-81e034c5da56_1200x1027.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img can-restack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;Antoine and Isaac. (Courtesy Antoine Archambault and Claire Fauvet.)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Antoine knew a bit about the disease, he explained to me, because he remembered a documentary he had seen about a paralympic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/05/sport/theo-curin-france-paralympics-spt-intl" rel&gt;swimmer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; who’d lost the outer parts of all four limbs as a child. Antoine also recalls thinking that Isaac was protected against it, because he and Claire were so diligent about getting Isaac his immunizations as soon as he was eligible. “I texted Claire, they suspect meningitis, but wasn’t he vaccinated?” Antoine told me. “And Claire was like, yes he is.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But France’s “schedule”—the list of vaccines required for public child care and school, and covered by national health insurance—had until recently excluded one of the two available meningococcal shots, each one being necessary for protection against different biological strains. A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.service-public.gouv.fr/particuliers/actualites/A17982?lang=en" rel&gt;new requirement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for the second version had taken effect on January 1, right after Isaac was born, and his appointment to get the vaccine was on the books. But it was not for another six weeks. That meant he remained at the mercy of the community around him, which—without widespread vaccination—included plenty of meningococcal carriers. Evidently one had given it to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next few hours remain a blur, Antoine told me. “I lost my footing, I lost my step, my legs were shaking all day,” he said, reaching for the English words to capture a state of mind as much as anything physical. Less than twenty-four hours before, Antoine had been playing with Isaac at an outdoor café, drawing out the baby’s smile with a favorite stuffed monkey that played music when you squeezed it. When Claire had rocked Isaac to sleep by holding him close to her chest, in what had become their routine, he had seemed absolutely fine. Now doctors were putting him into a medical coma, which they said was his best hope for survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claire, who had rushed back to Paris by train, arrived at the hospital not long after that and for a while it looked like treatment might work. Isaac’s vital signs even improved for a bit. But the recovery was illusory and his condition deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His heart stopped three times. Doctors were able to revive him after the first two. They were not after the third. At 6:35 p.m., Isaac was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;EARLIER THIS MONTH, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the CDC would be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/05/childhood-vaccine-schedule-new-cdc-recommendation-11-shots/" rel&gt;removing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; several &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-childhood-vaccine-schedule-changes-diseases-history-data/" rel&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from the list that it recommends for all American children. Among those CDC took off the list is the newer meningococcal vaccine, which has an excellent safety record and since its introduction had reduced the incidence of the disease in this country by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mening/hcp/about-vaccine.html#:~:text=Immunogenicity%20and%20Vaccine%20Effectiveness,at%20risk%20for%20meningococcal%20disease." rel&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Under the new guidelines, the agency recommends the shot only for high-risk groups (like people who are immunocompromised or college freshmen living in close quarters). For others, the agency suggests “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/20/shared-decision-making-vaccine-guidance-twists-meaning-of-term/" rel&gt;shared clinical decision-making&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,” meaning parents should discuss with their doctors whether the shots are advisable for their children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly how much will change—and exactly when—is hard to say. Insurers will continue to pay for the vaccines, administration officials said, as will a government-run program that administers immunizations to low-income children. Decisions about whether to require shots for school will remain with states, as they always have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But physicians, state officials, and insurers all use CDC recommendations to guide their own decisions and advice. That’s one reason the recommendations &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/06/what-new-vaccine-schedule-means-doctors-parents-kids/" rel&gt;matter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; so much, including to people like Kennedy with long histories of hostility to vaccines. Another is that the guidelines make it possible for Americans without medical training to know what the nation’s most trusted scientists believe, based on their assessment of the latest and best available research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Or at least that’s how it is supposed to work. This month’s retrenchment on vaccine policy—arguably the biggest in American history—is not based on new data or research that’s suddenly become available. Rather, it is based on a reassessment &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/aligning-united-states-core-childhood-vaccine-recommendations-with-best-practices-from-peer-developed-countries/" rel&gt;ordered up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; by Kennedy’s boss, President Donald Trump, that compared U.S. recommendations to those in peer countries around the world. “After an exhaustive review of the evidence,” Kennedy said in a statement, “we are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like so many other arguments Kennedy has made about vaccines, this claim about “consensus” is simply &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/09/childhood-vaccination-fact-check-denmark-not-america-is-the-outlier/" rel&gt;not true&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In reality, vaccine recommendations vary across Europe, North America, and Asia, even among peer countries. Before the Trump administration issued its directive this January, the United States was at the high end of the spectrum, with a recommendation of immunization against seventeen diseases. Now it’s at the low end, with a recommendation for twelve—or just one more than Denmark, the European country with the fewest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/robert-kennedy-rfk-jr-denmark-vaccines-hhs-maga-trump" rel&gt;no coincidence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Trump administration officials have said repeatedly that Denmark was their model, and arranged for a full presentation on the Danish recommendations during December’s meeting of the committee of outsiders that officially advises the CDC. The text of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/assessment-of-the-us-childhood-and-adolescent-immunization-schedule-compared-to-other-countries.pdf" rel&gt;assessment memo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; justifying the decision that the Trump administration released in early January cites “Denmark” or “Danish” authorities thirteen times—by far the most references for any country. A coauthor of the assessment is the same physician who gave the advisory committee presentation—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/19/tracy-beth-hoeg-fda-advisor-marty-makary-vinay-prasad-vaccine-policy/" rel&gt;Tracy Beth Høeg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a sports-medicine specialist who spent part of her career in Copenhagen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/robert-kennedy-rfk-jr-denmark-vaccines-hhs-maga-trump" rel&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/26/nx-s1-5656214/childhood-vaccination-denmark-rfk-policy" rel&gt;an&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/viewpoints-denmarks-vaccine-success-cant-be-copied-in-the-us-new-dietary-guidelines-dont-make-sense/" rel&gt;odd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/19/denmark-vaccine-schedule-vs-us/" rel&gt;choice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to be such a singular example given its relatively tiny population of six million people living in a quasi-socialist paradise. A truly “exhaustive” review of the evidence would have also considered some of the larger countries on the continent, especially anywhere the public has been arguing about vaccines or where officials recently changed recommendations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France turns out to be one such country—and in the case of the vaccine for meningococcal disease, an especially useful one for understanding both the policy debate and very personal meaning it has for families like Antoine’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-is-the-vaccine-story-rfk-jr-doesnt-want-you-to-hear-meningitis-meningococcal-disease?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-is-the-vaccine-story-rfk-jr-doesnt-want-you-to-hear-meningitis-meningococcal-disease?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE OBVIOUS REASON to consider France is that it simply looks a lot more like the United States than Denmark does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It has Western Europe’s third-largest economy, with a population of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/5677/demography-in-france/?srsltid=AfmBOoqjCMvVTyaJSjkS0bWnfv4aNtMPVk2hjNKxln2OuRC1-QpvHR5p#editorsPicks" rel&gt;nearly 70 million&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that is literally ten times larger than Denmark’s. France doesn’t have the kind of economic inequality that you find in the United States, because no Western or Northern European democracy does, but its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/gini-coefficient-by-country" rel&gt;socioeconomic breakdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; looks more like America’s than Denmark’s. Even the French health care system is a better analogue to that of the United States. It delivers universal coverage through a mixed public-private system in which access can vary depending on insurance type and wealth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But there’s something else about France that makes its experience relevant. Like the United States, France has a vocal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/14/956705043/france-has-1-of-the-highest-rates-of-vaccine-skepticism" rel&gt;anti-vaccination movement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, rooted partly in a political culture supportive of a strong central government but distrustful (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.truedem.eu/resources-and-deliverables/online-survey-2025" rel&gt;by European standards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) of the people and institutions who run them. “I think we are one of the world champions when it comes to vaccine hesitancy,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://research.pasteur.fr/en/member/muhamed-kheir-taha/" rel&gt;Muhamed Kheir-Taha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, who directs the invasive bacterial infections unit at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pasteur.fr/en" rel&gt;Institut Pasteur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in Paris, told me. There’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235239641630398X" rel&gt;survey data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to back that up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That tradition helps explain the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.02.095" rel&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jle.com/en/revues/vir/e-docs/les_nouvelles_obligations_vaccinales_un_tournant_dans_la_politique_de_sante_publique_francaise_311395/article.phtml" rel&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://infos.rtl.lu/news/frontieres/la-vaccination-obligatoire-interdite-en-droit-francais-pas-vraiment-1761203" rel&gt;vaccine laws&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. When the earliest vaccines for diseases like smallpox and polio became available during the early and mid-twentieth century, France made them mandatory, meaning they were a requirement for attending school. But as newer vaccines like the measles shot became available, French authorities merely “recommended” the vaccines—which meant, among other things, the national health system didn’t always pay for them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But agitation to change the policies reached a critical mass about twenty years ago, in part because physicians and public health experts worried vaccination rates for diseases like measles and pertussis would fall below herd immunity levels. French officials reacted by commissioning expert reports, and then convening public meetings so that the public had a chance both to hear the recommendations and offer feedback. The effort culminated in a 2017 law that added eight new vaccines to the mandatory list.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newer meningococcal shot was initially not one of them, because for each vaccine French authorities were weighing the costs and benefits in the context of allocating money in the national health insurance system. They decided those other strains of meningococcal disease were too rare to justify the expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the disease turned out to be not so rare after all, with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/les-actualites/2024/infections-invasives-a-meningocoque-recrudescence-de-cas-en-france-en-2023" rel&gt;rising&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/maladies-et-traumatismes/maladies-a-prevention-vaccinale/infections-invasives-a-meningocoque/documents/bulletin-national2/infections-invasives-a-meningocoque-en-france-en-2024" rel&gt;caseloads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-020-09487-7" rel&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in communal settings like schools. “We would get a lot of attention from the media for these, even when it was a single case, because they would be touching children or young adults in very good health, and then they may die within hours,” Taha said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French authorities had a playbook for these situations: They would surge vaccination to the affected areas, aiming to protect people before they could get exposed and develop the condition, while rushing treatment to the afflicted. But meningococcal disease acts so quickly that the surges inevitably were too late for some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The best way to avoid this disease—we told them—is to prevent the disease, not to treat it afterwards,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gpip.fr/organisation/" rel&gt;Hervé Haas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, president of the French pediatric infectious disease association, explained to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once again, French authorities listened to the doctors and public health experts: In 2024, they added the second meningococcal vaccine to the mandatory list. The hope is that the requirement will dramatically improve uptake, which is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6607743/" rel&gt;what happened&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; with the vaccines that France made mandatory in 2017.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;THE STRATEGY THAT FRANCE ABANDONED—making the vaccine strictly voluntary, and then surging resources to stop outbreaks once they start—is similar to the one that Kennedy and the Trump administration just embraced. But if you look at that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/assessment-of-the-us-childhood-and-adolescent-immunization-schedule-compared-to-other-countries.pdf" rel&gt;assessment memo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that HHS released in January, you won’t find acknowledgement that the French recently adopted the meningococcal vaccine, let alone an explanation for why the authors believe the United States should be moving in precisely the opposite direction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, you won’t find any references to France—or any signs that memo’s authors seriously studied the experience of European countries other than Denmark. When I asked HHS about this explicitly—whether larger, more comparable nations like France, Germany, and the U.K. had been given the consideration that Denmark had—I got a boilerplate response: “Many peer nations achieve high vaccination rates without mandates by relying on trust, education, and strong doctor-patient relationships,” HHS Press Secretary Emily Hilliard wrote in an email, “and HHS will work with states and clinicians to ensure families have clear, accurate information to make their own informed decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilliard also described the review as “thorough,” echoing what Kennedy has said, although it is a bit difficult to take that seriously when the entirety of the assessment is just thirty pages long. And because it’s a memo justifying decisions on several vaccinations, it gives only scant attention to each. The explanatory section on meningococcal disease is just four paragraphs, or barely 200 words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just for comparison, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6202.pdf" rel&gt;document&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the CDC used in 2013 when first recommending the newer meningococcal vaccine had roughly 18,000 words—on the meningococcal vaccine alone—with highly detailed reviews of research, projections of how different recommendations would play out in the real world, and other sorts of information you’d want officials to consider in making these kinds of decisions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That document is a reflection of the work that went into it—literally years of study and debating, with the CDC director ultimately making decisions after public votes by the outside committee of experts. Nothing like that happened this year, despite Kennedy’s promises of “radical transparency.” The CDC simply announced the decision one day, without warning, with the director signing off on a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/decision-memo-adopting-revised-childhood-adolescent-immunization-schedule.pdf" rel&gt;recommendation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; he got from the heads of three other government agencies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Outside of a genuine emergency, our government should not be waking up in the morning, brushing its teeth, and abruptly announcing major shifts in longstanding policy,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1781/joshua-m-sharfstein" rel&gt;Joshua Sharfstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a pediatrician and former deputy FDA commissioner now on faculty at Johns Hopkins University, told me. “The basis for changing course should be released well in advance, reviewed by independent experts, and modified as needed through careful consideration and explanation. It is a process with integrity that distinguishes thoughtful policymaking from a power grab.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-is-the-vaccine-story-rfk-jr-doesnt-want-you-to-hear-meningitis-meningococcal-disease?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-is-the-vaccine-story-rfk-jr-doesnt-want-you-to-hear-meningitis-meningococcal-disease?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;TO RATIONALIZE ITS DECISION, the Trump administration memo cites a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WER8647" rel&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from the World Health Organization, which recommended society-wide vaccination only in countries where the case level is higher than it is in the United States. But the primary audience for WHO guidance is officials trying to make the most of scarce medical resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s not the way things work here, for better or worse depending on your perspective. The American system throws all kinds of money at saving lives—even for interventions that cost way more than vaccination—because that’s what &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/icer-vs-nice-drug-pricing-comparison" rel&gt;wealthier countries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; do when they want to prioritize health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Once you’ve seen a case of meningococcal disease, you are thinking my god, I never ever want to see a case like that again,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://advances.massgeneral.org/contributors/contributor.aspx?id=1818" rel&gt;Rochelle Walensky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the Harvard-affiliated pediatric infectious disease specialist and former CDC director, told me. “When you have seen a completely viable, young, vibrant person who suddenly obtunded [meaning barely responsive] with bacterial meningitis—and you know their life will never be the same—then the answer is that if there is anything I can do to prevent this, if I can prevent it safely, you’re going to do it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One other person who understands all too well the menace of the disease is Antoine. And he wants to do something about it. He and Claire have raised money to support research into the disease and to promote training for medical professionals, so they are better able to recognize it quickly. They’ve worked with local and national groups that are affiliated with the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.meningitis.org/como/" rel&gt;Confederation of Meningitis Organisations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a U.K.-based international organization trying to promote awareness and research worldwide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ve also tried to do what they can to spread the word about the vaccine among friends and professional contacts. (Antoine is a consultant who works with banks on regulatory compliance, and Claire a lawyer.) Antoine told me he got “pretty pissed off” recently when he heard a friend got advice from a doctor not to get the shot, because they were not part of a high-risk group. “This is a big fight for us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before our video call ended, Antoine shared some photos, all of them with Isaac smiling in exactly the way I had been told. And when Antoine was done recounting that awful day last April, he told me about the quiet memorial service they held at the hospital—and the burial, with about a hundred family and friends present. Antoine said that he and Claire were careful to bundle Isaac in his favorite blanket with sheep and stars on it, and to make sure he had his beloved stuffed monkey with him. The cemetery is near their apartment. Antoine said he visits every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-is-the-vaccine-story-rfk-jr-doesnt-want-you-to-hear-meningitis-meningococcal-disease/comments","text":"Leave a comment","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/this-is-the-vaccine-story-rfk-jr-doesnt-want-you-to-hear-meningitis-meningococcal-disease/comments" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leave a comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Bulwark</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxQS1JnOURQelNqa19EQXNfaXVSSlhZMVdoR1pLM1hCNE9SRzRyUC14ZTlhcEhIXzdXdnk3dXJDMm9XYWJGQVRYMm9UTkI5QWFxZnM0ZktPZXR0RHNzaEYtZEpEeEFZMUxsSEJJUG1oWVlKenV2LU9DNFZDdFBTcnp6REItbHZxYnRuS0pVU2ZlNVhEblEwSDNiUXNxU1ljRC05ZHVUb0FtREVFa0Y3ZjB4dGRpSFd2ZWthTUE</guid></item><item><title>AHA表示，近90%的美国人患有无症状心脏病- NewsNation</title><link>https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/american-heart-association-cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic-syndrome/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Fiber is on pace to be the next "it" nutrient of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers — particularly Gen Z — are fixated on stomach health, leading to the "fibermaxxing" trend taking hold on TikTok. As people try to maximize the fiber in their meals, major food companies are capitalizing on the trend with new, fiber-focused products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a consumer need in terms of digestion and gut health, and that's something we've seen the last few years," said Sherry Frey, health and wellness thought leader at NIQ. The younger generation, she added, understands that digestive health is linked to better skin and improved cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dataessential, a food and beverage research firm, found that 52% of consumers were interested in trying "fibermaxxing" after learning about the trend and that 42% of shoppers think food labeled "high fiber" is healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber builds on previous wellness-focused consumer trends, Frey told CNN. First was hydration, as seen with the rise of products like Liquid I.V. and Electrolit. Then protein, a trend that shows no sign of slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The natural next step is for fiber," she said, calling the converging of trends a "perfect storm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, fiber has been proven to trigger "a naturally occurring GLP-1 in our bodies," she added, referencing the appetite-suppressing hormone in weight-loss drugs like Wegovy that are flooding the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Big Food responds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers' desire for fiber is already evident on grocery store shelves. Whole Foods' &lt;a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/trends/the-next-big-things-our-top-8-food-trend-predictions-for-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; for 2026 said there are "more fiber-forward callouts on packaging" as well as more products with added fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrive Market, a membership-based online supermarket, has seen fiber-related terms surge 30% over the past year with shoppers gravitating toward snacks, bars and supplements, a spokesperson told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major food companies have taken notice: PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said on its most recent earnings call in October that "fiber will be the next protein."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consumers are starting to understand that fiber is the benefit that they need. It's actually a deficiency in U.S. consumers' diets, and that will be elevated," Laguarta told analysts. (More than 90% of women and 97% of men don't get their recommended daily intake of fiber, the U.S. government &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in 2020.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo is already bolstering its soda portfolio with fiber-forward products. Last summer, it launched a gut-friendly soda following its purchase of Poppi with "Pepsi Prebiotic Cola," which includes added fiber. More products are on the way, including fiber-enhanced versions of its SunChips, Smartfood popcorn and Propel hydration packets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski also recently predicted on his Instagram account that fiber "is going to be big" in 2026, perhaps signaling that the fast-food chain could dip its toes into the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snacks, such as chips and puffed crackers, will be the battleground for fiber, Frey predicts, notably products made from legumes and beans. But taste is a factor, especially if it's made from plant-based ingredients.&lt;strong&gt;﻿&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consumers are willing to make a trade, but they're not always willing to make the trade if the taste isn't there," Frey said. "Despite the economy, they're willing to pay a little more for these kinds of products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's where private labels created by major grocery stores come in. They are also getting into the wellness sector with fiber-enchanced products, but without the premium prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aldi's recently relaunched in-house line includes knock-offs of "better for you" sodas and meal bars. Walmart is expanding its Bettergoods lineup, which encompasses several foods that have plant-based ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is this healthy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended amount of fiber is 25 grams per day for adult women to 35 for adult males, according to medical experts, so "it's a generally good healthy trend," said Paul Kriegler, a registered dietician and senior director of nutritional products for Life Time Fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the prepackaged products hitting shelves are not a panacea for this deficiency. He would rather consumers gravitate toward the produce and vegetable section at the grocery store for their fiber needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government's newly released dietary guidelines also urge people to prioritize "real food," including "fiber-rich whole grains," as well as curtail their intake of highly processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What I've taught clients for a long time is to eat a pile of vegetables the size of your head every day," Kreigler told CNN.

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;Adult content has never been as accessible as it is now, thanks to the internet. Hell, online smut &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/porn-behind-internet-technologies-2017-5" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;played a major role&lt;/a&gt; in the rise of the web itself in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;With that glut of porn, some have voiced concerns that some people are &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/04/pornography" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;consuming too much&lt;/a&gt; of the stuff or even becoming addicted, which they claim could have consequences like regulating emotions or impaired sexual functioning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;But as &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/frequent-pornography-use-does-not-always-indicate-a-problem-new-study-suggests/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PsyPost&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, these concerns may be overblown. Researchers at the University of Pécs in Hungary have found that it doesn’t matter how frequently one watches porn; the reasons why somebody indulges in the stuff are far more predictive of their sexual health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19317611.2025.2605517" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Sexual Health&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers found that positive motivations, such as “enhancing sexual pleasure, exploring fantasies, or deepening intimacy,” were “associated with frequent but non-problematic pornography use and with adaptive sexual regulation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;However, those with “negative motivations,” such as “stress reduction, emotional escape, or avoidance of discomfort,” were strongly linked to “sexual system hyperactivation, emotion regulation difficulties, and impaired relational functioning.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The study involved  890 adult participants in Hungary, including 600 individuals assigned female at birth and 290 assigned male at birth. The participants submitted answers anonymously through an online survey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“A major gap in the literature is that pornography use is often evaluated mainly by how frequently people use it, even though frequency alone tells us very little about whether use is actually harmful,” University of Pécs psychology professor Norbert Meskó told &lt;em&gt;PsyPost&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“We were interested in whether these different motivations are linked to different patterns of sexual and emotional functioning,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Most strikingly, the researchers found that participants who reported frequent pornography use were less likely to experience problematic outcomes. However, those who primarily used it for coping and managing stress were more likely to experience symptoms of problematic use, indicating that frequency isn’t the main indicator of whether it’s actually harmful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“One somewhat surprising finding was that frequent use, when driven by positive motivations, was linked to less sexual deactivation — meaning less emotional withdrawal from sexuality,” Meskó told &lt;em&gt;PsyPost&lt;/em&gt;. “In contrast, only problematic use — not frequent use — was associated with these kinds of disengaged or avoidant sexual patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Importantly, problematic use showed much stronger links to difficulties in sexual and emotional functioning than simple frequency did,” he added. “This suggests that from a practical standpoint, it is more useful to look at whether someone feels out of control or distressed by their use than at how often they watch pornography.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Of course, as the researchers note in their paper, there are some limitations to their research. For one, the self-reported nature of their data may not be reliable, as it relies on memory. It also may not be generalizable to a broader population as a result.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Multiple motivations for pornography use may also overlap — for instance, seeking pleasure while also distracting from stress — meaning that some cases may not neatly fit into either positive or negative motivations. One category may also quickly shift to another, further complicating the picture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“We would caution against thinking of pornography as either simply ‘good’ or ‘bad,'” Meskó told &lt;em&gt;PsyPost&lt;/em&gt;. “For some people, it may be part of healthy sexual expression, while for others it may function as a way to avoid emotional problems or relationship difficulties.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="picture"&gt;Photo: VCG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thai Ministry of Public Health on Sunday began screening air passengers arriving from India for possible Nipah virus infection after five Nipah virus cases were reported and nearly 100 people were quarantined in India's eastern state of West Bengal, according to media reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening is being carried out at Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang airports, focusing on travellers arriving from West Bengal. Authorities said passengers and relevant agencies have been cooperative, Thai media outlet The Nation Thailand reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry has also issued a "Health Beware Card" for travellers arriving from risk areas. It advises anyone who develops symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, sore throat, cough, difficulty breathing, drowsiness, confusion or seizures—especially if they have had contact with bats, sick animals or an infected person within 21 days before arriving in Thailand—to seek medical attention immediately, The Nation Thailand reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Indian authorities are rushing to contain a Nipah virus outbreak after five cases were reported and nearly 100 people quarantined in the eastern state of West Bengal, The Independent reported Friday local time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three new infections were reported earlier this week, authorities said, adding to two existing cases of nurses, one male and one female, who had earlier tested positive. The nurses were working at a private hospital in Barasat near the state capital of Kolkata, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides Thailand screening air passengers arriving from India, the Government of Nepal has heightened nationwide alertness to prevent the possible entry of the Nipah virus, following its recent spread in India's neighboring state of West Bengal, according to Nepalese media outlet The Annapurna Express on January 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokesperson for the Nepal Ministry of Health and Population, Prakash Budhathoki, said the government has put adequate preventive measures in place. Health screenings have been initiated for passengers arriving at Tribhuvan International Airport, as well as at major border points with India, The Annapurna Express reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have intensified surveillance particularly at border points in Koshi Province. Similar health checks have also been ordered at other border crossings," Budhathoki said, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Nipah virus is classified as a priority pathogen owing to its epidemic potential. There are no vaccines or treatment for Nipah virus. Nipah virus infection in humans causes a range of clinical presentations, from asymptomatic infection (subclinical) to acute respiratory infection and fatal encephalitis, says WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A member of the Henipavirus genus, Nipah virus is mainly carried by fruit bats of the Pteropus species, creating a constant risk of spillover to humans through contaminated food or direct contact. With no approved vaccine or specific antiviral treatment available, and fatality rates in past outbreaks ranging between 40 percent and 75 percent, Nipah remains a serious public health threat wherever it emerges, according to the Indian local media the Economist Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global Times
