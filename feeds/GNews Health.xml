      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;Fitzgerald said &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/introduction-to-menopause" target="_blank"&gt;hot flashes are one of the most commonly reported symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of perimenopause and menopause. "A hot flush or flash is caused by hormonal fluctuations, particularly changes in estrogen levels. During perimenopause, estrogen levels fluctuate much like a rollercoaster, which can lead to temperature dysregulation and trigger hot flashes. After menopause, when there is a steep decline in estrogen levels, hot flashes often continue but may become less frequent over time," she explained.&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Irregular periods and night sweats are other &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/perimenopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20354666" target="_blank"&gt;common symptoms of perimenopause&lt;/a&gt; and menopause. "Hot flushes are an example of vasomotor symptoms. Other symptoms include brain fog, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, joint aches and pains, muscle pain, dry eyes or hair, tinnitus, vaginal dryness, rescues libido, weight gain, reduced energy levels," Fitzgerald said, adding that people may experience all, some, or none of these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The groundbreaking move offered a rare and powerful opportunity to see dementia developing in human brain cells. Experts said the new way of studying the disease could make it easier to test new drugs and boost the chances of finding ones that work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dementia presents a big threat to health and social care systems across the world. The number of people affected is forecast to triple to nearly 153 million by 2050, which underlines why finding new ways to study the disease and speed up the search for treatments is a health priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the study, scientists and neurosurgeons in Edinburgh teamed up to show for the first time how a toxic form of a protein linked to Alzheimer’s, amyloid beta, can stick to and destroy vital connections between brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Tiny fragments of healthy brain tissue were collected from cancer patients while they were undergoing routine surgery to remove tumours at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8b8c69be-6cd6-43cb-a6e9-4944996e5fa2" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Living brain tissue cultures are placed inside an incubator set at 37C to mimic body temperature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Scientists dressed in scrubs were stationed in operating theatres alongside surgical teams, ready to receive the healthy brain tissue, which would otherwise have been discarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Once the pieces of brain were retrieved, scientists put them in glass bottles filled with oxygenated artificial spinal fluid before jumping into taxis to transport the samples to their lab a few minutes away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We pretty much ran back to the lab,” said Dr Claire Durrant, a Race Against Dementia fellow and UK Dementia Research Institute emerging leader at the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There, samples were sliced into thin pieces, less than a third of a millimetre thick, and laid out in small dishes. Each piece of living brain tissue was kept in a nutrient-rich liquid, inside an incubator at 37C to mimic body temperature. “And then we start experiments almost straight away,” Durrant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Fragments of human brain were kept alive in dishes for up to a fortnight, with the patient’s permission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers extracted the toxic form of amyloid beta from people who died from Alzheimer’s disease and then applied it to the healthy living brain tissue in their dishes. “We’re trying to mimic Alzheimer’s disease,” said Durrant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="24dbd054-ad95-4f99-a061-759dc717918c" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;From left: Dr Claire Durrant, Sir James Dyson and Sir Jackie Stewart.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Douglas Robertson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Unlike when exposed to a normal form of the protein, the brain did not attempt to repair damage caused by the toxic form of amyloid beta, her team found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Even small changes in natural levels of amyloid beta – increasing or decreasing – were enough to disrupt brain cells. This suggests that the brain requires a finely tuned sweet spot of the protein to function properly, Durrant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Working alongside the neurosurgical team at the University of Edinburgh, we have shown that living human brain slices can be used to explore fundamental questions relating to Alzheimer’s disease,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-17" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alzheimer’s attacks synapses and their loss strongly predicts reduced memory and thinking abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Durrant’s team also found that brain slices taken from the temporal lobe, a region known to be affected early in Alzheimer’s, released higher levels of tau, another key disease protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This may explain why this part of the brain is particularly vulnerable in early Alzheimer’s, as increased tau release may enable toxic forms of this protein to spread faster between cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The research was backed by Race Against Dementia, a charity formed by Sir Jackie Stewart after his wife’s dementia diagnosis, and a £1m donation from the James Dyson Foundation, a charity supporting medical research and engineering education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dyson said the breakthrough represented progress “towards solving one of the most devastating problems of our time”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Working with brain surgeons and their consenting patients to collect samples of living human brain and keep them alive in the lab is a groundbreaking method,” he said. “It allows researchers to better examine Alzheimer’s disease on real human brain cells rather than relying on animal substitutes, such as mice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Tara Spires-Jones, group leader at the UK Dementia Research Institute, hailed the important development. Seeing early Alzheimer’s in real-time provided a new tool for scientists to better understand the disease and how to treat it, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She said: “The use of living human tissue samples generously donated by people undergoing surgery to remove brain tumours allows scientists to probe how living human brain reacts to toxic proteins produced in Alzheimer’s, and in future will allow testing of whether new treatments are effective in human brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 19:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNVEFxT2NpaWRVWm5GM3BwWFU0Z21lYnBfcTFQY0l4bjM1d01JbGZUQXFHQi1sVXA5eEdvRktoRkYxWkg1Q24yZDJySzA0UzBHNEpDZmVIZDJvYzlkTXo0MGttWkhBdjQ0bndwYnZ1dkpPbEZ0dnZneEZzNW5HaWxOenFBZVd4UjdDandkNXhtLWZ0Q0dDUlpydDNuN2FiU3F1ank4QWpLdWlfalFUU2MweC1TUHpIUE95Q0E</guid></item><item><title>M Health Fairview表示，它无法说明一名男子是如何死亡的；记录显示并非如此- kare11.com | M Health Fairview said it couldn't say how a man died; records say otherwise - kare11.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgJBVV95cUxNM1dQSmU0WndfTlczY0liOVA0d01GQklDcFRiMl9MOVhGdG1CR0tVa3p1SndzWHY4T3JZQlo0TFBlTWNLQkViRkwzOWdhdEdTbGJNT3pQWmc0SGJhWUgyOW1YVFdSdmcxaktmQ09SMXhzRW45N05zWnBDMWJoU0hkZWpJcGs3TTJ1ZDhlYU1DZ0RHcWFuUVhfWVp2TnVwa04tUlZwTWltbUoxcWFWRWIyVEYxcXZjSFBQcEtTWElvdzdLdGQ4el9KdFl6OFBpLTlhQVBjck5mRHE2NjVaR0d1QmhOV01CdTBFMUNUczJyeG02cUpiWmw3UGRlcHR0bnhqR3JSQUdBWXdCTXhNbXF3NVctTkVOdEIzOEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="longform__body"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Westrum, 80, had recently suffered a stroke and had been admitted to M Health Fairview Southdale with shortness of breath and pneumonia just four days earlier. But his condition had improved enough that he had been moved to a step-down unit while awaiting transfer to a nursing home. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just hours later, Briana received a call to come back to the hospital. When she arrived, she was not allowed into her father’s room and was directed to the chapel. There, she was told her father was dead. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was unbelievable,” Briana said, “based on the condition that I saw him in that morning.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briana said the hospital told her that Steven had suffered external bleeding but offered no further details.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They said he had bled externally, but they were not aware of what had happened yet, that they would need to do some investigation and look into it,” she said.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two months, she was left without answers. Then came the autopsy. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="longform__chapter longform__chapter_featured-state_collapsed" id="longform_chapter_1"&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="longform__chapter-heading"&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-number"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="longform__chapter-heading-separator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-title"&gt; The Meeting&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Steven Westrum’s death did not seem connected to an intentional act, records show the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office declined to do a forensic autopsy.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That left the autopsy, which Briana said she wanted done, to be completed by the M Health Fairview system. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the hospital autopsy was completed in May 2024, Briana says she was contacted to set up a meeting to discuss the results. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briana, who works in risk management, told KARE 11 she was suspicious because of the lack of answers she’d received to date, so she and her husband decided to secretly record the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business cards handed to Briana by the two hospital representatives in attendance show she met with Dr. Dan Frechette, Fairview Health Services' vice president of medical affairs at Ridges and Southdale hospitals, along with VP Adam Karlen, Fairview’s chief nursing officer. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this case, a bleeding event may have contributed, and so it is our responsibility to be transparent about that,” one of the men can be heard telling Briana in the recording, “and also to do what we can to try to address it from happening in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hospital executives explained that Steven’s IV catheter had become disconnected at some point in the afternoon, they weren’t sure when or how, and that uncapped catheter — which did not have backflow prevention — was the source of what they labeled “the bleeding event.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They called the event “extremely rare” but also downplayed the known role it played in Steven’s death.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it's just so difficult to know what the impact of that was,” one of the hospital representatives said.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can't say definitively that this caused your father's death,” Briana was told in the recording. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M Health Fairview’s autopsy results also offered few answers, but one important clue. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="longform__chapter longform__chapter_featured-state_collapsed" id="longform_chapter_2"&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="longform__chapter-heading"&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-number"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="longform__chapter-heading-separator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-title"&gt; A Natural Death&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M Health Fairview autopsy on the body of Steven Westrum was conducted by pathologists at the University of Minnesota Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first page, the anatomic cause of death is listed as “Not Identified.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of significant contributory conditions are listed, including severe coronary artery disease, hypertension and pneumonia.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood loss is not among the contributing conditions listed. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on page five, under the “Clinical Information” section, there is a notation that for Briana, screams off the page. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like reading a horror story,” she said while looking at the document. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notation reads, “He was found with an uncapped IV catheter in his arm and was lying in a pool of blood that was congealed at the edges.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the clinical finding that Steven lost so much blood it pooled beneath him, pathologists wrote, “multiple medical conditions were identified at autopsy, and correlated with clinical information, that may have contributed to his death.”  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They concluded, “Taken together, these findings do not point to an acute or specific cause of death.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The autopsy listed Steven’s manner of death as “Natural.”&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="longform__chapter longform__chapter_featured-state_collapsed" id="longform_chapter_3"&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="longform__chapter-heading"&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-number"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="longform__chapter-heading-separator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-title"&gt; The Death Certificate&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days after she met with the hospital executives, on May 30, 2024, Briana received another call, this time from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This call would completely change her understanding of her father’s death. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ME’s office was preparing her father’s death certificate and wanted to go over the case and the wording. Briana was told the official cause of death was exsanguination — a severe loss of blood — due to a catheter mishap. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briana was told for the first time that her father did not die from a natural combination of his underlying health conditions. She, instead, was told he conclusively bled to death in his hospital bed.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unbelievable, unbelievable,” she said. “There’s nothing natural about this, nothing!” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike what Briana had been told by M Health Fairview, records kept by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner show their investigator was immediately informed by the hospital on the day Steven died that he had “exsanguinated … due to an uncapped IV.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ME investigator's narrative shows that Dr. Christopher Aronson with Fairview Southdale Hospital called the ME’s office on March 16, 2024, to report the death. He said that “a lab tech went into the decedent’s room to draw blood and found the decedent unresponsive with a pool of blood on the floor next to his bed.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was estimated that Steven had lost “about 4 liters of blood.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal hospital notes later obtained by Briana show staff wrote, “There was a large amount of blood on the left side of the patient's body and a large pool of blood underneath the patient's bed, which was apparently congealed at the edges and dried (did not wet the tip of glove).” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="longform__chapter longform__chapter_featured-state_collapsed" id="longform_chapter_4"&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="longform__chapter-heading"&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-number"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="longform__chapter-heading-separator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-title"&gt; 'Smacks of protectionism'&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The human body only holds about five liters of blood,” says Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who previously served as the president of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At KARE 11’s request, Dr. Weedn reviewed all of the hospital medical and autopsy records, along with the ME’s reports. He said in his opinion the autopsy “smacks of protectionism of the hospital.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s significant when you see that four liters of blood was lost?” KARE 11 asked. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, yes,” Weedn responded, “Four liters of blood is clearly a lethal event. There is absolutely no mystery about what caused Mr. Westrum’s death. He definitely died from blood loss.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briana has since hired attorney Jeff Montpetit and is preparing to file a medical malpractice lawsuit against M Health Fairview. Montpetit called the case “the most deviant thing I have ever seen in my history as a lawyer.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="longform__chapter longform__chapter_featured-state_collapsed" id="longform_chapter_5"&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="longform__chapter-heading"&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-number"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="longform__chapter-heading-separator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-title"&gt; A Mistake&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to KARE 11’s investigation, M Health Fairview declined an interview.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after repeated questioning by KARE 11 about the details of its autopsy, the hospital system did an about-face. It admitted it was a mistake for the manner of death to have been listed as “natural.” The hospital system also pledged it would be changed to "Accidental."&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KARE 11 made the editorial decision to publish their lengthy statement in full: &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are deeply saddened by the passing of Mr. Westrum and regret the circumstances surrounding his death. While adverse events are rare, we recognize that even one is too many. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We want to be clear: our care team communicated with Mr. Westrum’s family about the IV catheter disconnection and visible bleeding following the incident. These details were documented in the medical record, discussed with the family, included in the hospital’s autopsy narrative, and reported to regulatory bodies. We take every incident seriously, and this highly unusual complication was no exception. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hospital autopsy report listed the cause of death as “not identified” and the manner of death as “natural.” After further review, we acknowledge that this classification may not fully reflect the circumstances surrounding the event. Based on the clinical context, a classification of “undetermined” or “accidental" may have been more appropriate. The classification in the autopsy report had no bearing on our response to this incident. It did not impact our disclosure process with the family, reporting it through appropriate oversight and safety reporting channels, or our extensive analysis of the event and corrective action plans developed. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was not an attempt to mislead or conceal what occurred. Rather, it reflects the reality that over 95% of hospital deaths are classified as natural, while non-natural classifications are uncommon. Our chief of pathology has reviewed this case and will share additional training and process updates across the pathology team as part of our ongoing commitment to transparency, learning, and patient safety. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Westrum wanted his ashes spread in a place he loved to visit: Copper Harbor, Michigan.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer, Briana plans to honor that wish, embarking on a final journey with her father, who, even at 80 years old and in failing health, she believes died too soon.&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He bled out externally — almost all the blood in his body over a period of time,” she said, “and no accountability for that.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;

lucid dreaming&lt;/a&gt; is more than just a vivid sleep state, it's actually a whole other state of consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucid dreaming occurs when a person becomes aware they are dreaming, often gaining the ability to control the dream’s events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For instance, they might fly, walk through walls, or confront fears, taking advantage of the limitless possibilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously, scientists believed lucid dreams were simply more vivid or intense versions of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14078587/dreams-scientist-bizarre-sleep-paralysis-lucid.html"&gt;the typical dreams that occur during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep&lt;/a&gt;, which is a normal phase of the sleep cycle characterized by increased brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this new study shows that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14590121/Jaw-dropping-scan-shows-mouse-brain-youve-never-seen-before.html"&gt;brain activity patterns&lt;/a&gt; during a lucid dream are entirely different from those that occur during regular dreams and wakefulness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These patterns reflect changes in how brain regions activate and communicate, linked to shifts in perception, memory, self-awareness, and cognitive control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, they found that lucid dreaming was associated with reduced beta brain waves (which are linked to waking consciousness and alertness) in two different brain regions that control spatial awareness, sense of touch and self-perception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, gamma waves, which indicate heightened focus and consciousness, increased in the medial prefrontal cortex, a region involved in self-referential thinking and metacognition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These findings suggest lucid dreaming is a unique neural state, offering new insights into consciousness and potential applications in therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers have discovered that lucid dreaming is more than just a vivid sleep state, it's actually a whole other state of consciousness &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This research opens the door to a deeper understanding of lucid dreaming as an intricate state of consciousness by pointing to the possibility that conscious experience can arise from within sleep itself,' said lead researcher Çağatay Demirel, of Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This work offers a perspective that could challenge the traditional binary view of sleep and wakefulness in future research,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Demirel and his colleagues compiled an enormous amount of data from previous sleep studies — which measured brain activity with EEGs — into what they believe is now the largest dataset in this field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They then compared brain activity patterns for wakefulness, REM sleep and lucid dreaming to determine what makes each state unique. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the surface level, brain activity during lucid dreaming did not look all that different from REM sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when the researchers dove deeper to look at the sources of electrical signals in the brain, key differences began to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The reduction in beta waves associated with lucid dreaming was isolated to the right temporal lobe (which controls spatial awareness and nonverbal memory) and the parietal lobe (which controls the senses and self-perception).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beta waves are high-frequency brain waves that are typically associated with a wakeful state. They are involved in conscious thought and logical thinking, and tend to have a stimulating effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucid dreams are dreams where the dreamer is aware they are dreaming and can sometimes control what happens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers suggest that this reduction could signal the brain's process of recognizing that the dream is not real, thereby allowing the dreamer to become aware that they are dreaming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found an increase in gamma waves in the right precuneus, which plays an important role in spatially guided behavior and imagining one's own actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This surge of gamma activity coincided with the moment the dreamer realizes they are dreaming, suggesting that it may further reflect the brain's process of becoming lucid while sleeping.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded that these patterns of brain activity are totally unique to lucid dreaming, indicating that it is its own state of consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But perhaps more interestingly, they also found that these patterns are most similar to the brain activity associated with the effects of psychedelic drugs such as LSD and ayahuasca. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like lucid dreams, these psychedelic experiences are also associated with activity changes in the precuneus, according to the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But 'While psychedelics often lead to a dissolution of ego and decreased self-referential processing . . . lucid dreams may actually harness elements of self-awareness &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and control,' Demirel they wrote in their report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team published their findings in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2025/03/27/JNEUROSCI.2237-24.2025"&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lucid dreams can occur spontaneously, but you can also train yourself to have them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers have identified several techniques that can help you induce a lucid dream. But the Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams, also known as the 'MILD' technique, is among the most effective, according to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/dreams/lucid-dreams"&gt;SleepFoundation.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's designed to be used when you wake up in the middle of the night, and involves four basic steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, upon awakening, try to recall what you have been dreaming about or the details of a dream you just had that you'd like to reenter.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, identify signs from the dream that will help you realize that you're dreaming once you reenter it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Say the words: 'When I begin dreaming, I will remember that I'm dreaming.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then continue recalling the dream content and repeating that phrase until you fall back asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This technique is more effective for some people than others, but it tends to result in lucid dreaming 20 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 17:37:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>年轻人的肠癌发病率正在上升-《经济学人》 | Rates of bowel cancer are rising among young people - The Economist</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxPUzlvRjZHa2xQRi1DNkd5YkJtdDRYcXNZdmstR3pHX0RNekgtLU5VUlBzWkN1clMtN21ETENpbGJ1NDFzVjBJSHU2RVRXdjRmcHBCcVB1aFY1MllvSnFDeXhhSnNMcFlYX0czRTdsd29jb3prYW5IeG1MRGg4bzQ5TmhXYkoza2tyclZoam5rSTdPNklSMERHcHlBcGlKb3M0VG5MclNud09hcmdBR0JSSg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-p6fe6o efq1yh21"&gt;&lt;p data-component="paragraph" class="css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0"&gt;&lt;span data-caps="initial"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;T EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS&lt;/small&gt; across the world, patients are presenting with undiagnosed cancers at an advanced stage.

Two key neuromodulators, serotonin and neurotensin, were found to control opposing emotional responses in a brain region responsible for learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a mouse model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), activating serotonin receptors restored the ability to form positive impressions from social interactions.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ability to recognize and distinguish unpleasant from pleasant interactions is essential for humans to navigate their social environment,” says Xiaoting Wu, PhD, Assistant Professor of Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Until now, it has been unclear how the brain assigns positivity or negativity—‘valence’—to social experiences, and how that information can be flexibly updated in a constantly changing environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the center of this complex neural circuitry is the hippocampus, located deep in the temporal lobe of the brain and responsible for forming new memories, learning, and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mount Sinai researchers described how two neuromodulators—serotonin and neurotensin, which influence processes such as mood, arousal, and neural plasticity—are released into the hippocampal subregion known as ventral CA1, where they control opposing social valence assignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both neurotransmitters impact distinct populations of ventral CA1 neurons through their respective receptors, serotonin 1B and neurotensin 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While deficits in social valence are known to be prevalent in many neuropsychiatric disorders, their underlying neural mechanisms and pathophysiology have remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through our work we’ve provided the first foundational insights into the neural basis of social valence,” notes Dr. Wu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have demonstrated that the neuromodulators serotonin and neurotensin signal opposing valence, revealing a fundamental principle of brain function in the form of a neuromodulatory switch that allows behavioral adaptation based on social history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the team developed a novel social cognitive paradigm that involved exposing mice to negative and positive social encounters. In the negative social encounter, the test mouse was exposed to a mean/aggressive mouse; in the positive encounter, the mouse was exposed to a potential mate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both assays the mice had negative or neutral/positive or neutral interaction and then got to choose which mouse they would like to spend more time with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without prior experience, the mice did not have a preference, but with the experience, they associated a mouse with a positive or negative valence and then learned to avoid the “bad” mouse or approach the “good” mouse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, the team uncovered specific drug targets for positive and negative valence, knowledge that could potentially factor into future treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, serotonin acting on the serotonin 1B receptor generates a positive impression of a social encounter, while neurotensin acting on the neurotensin 1 receptor creates a negative impression. Imbalanced emotional processing of those two social experiences is known to be a debilitating symptom of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, by activating the serotonin 1B receptor, researchers were able to restore a positive impression associated with rewarding social experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We identified a specific neuromodulator receptor which we then targeted to rescue social cognitive deficits in a mouse model of ASD,” Dr. Wu explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On a broader scale, our work provides critical insights into complex social behaviors while revealing potential therapeutic targets that can be leveraged to improve social cognitive deficits in common neuropsychiatric disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by funding from NIH K99 Career Development Award (grant no.

Tari published their book “Microtraining – 7 weeks to boost fitness and strength” in January this year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the same researchers have looked at the connection between physical activity, or being in good physical shape, and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109390"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging.jpg" alt="This shows a woman running and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers point out that exercising much less than what the current recommendations recommend can provide great benefits – as long as the intensity of the training is high. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was conducted with colleagues from the Queensland Brain Institute in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Promising measures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which has been published in the British medical journal The Lancet, shows that the brain definitely benefits from physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even small amounts of high intensity exercise have an effect on the brain. This should be communicated more clearly – it may be what motivates people to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endurance training and good fitness can reduce the risk of dementia and promote healthy brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;” And it is never too late to start,” says Atefe R. Tari, the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even small amounts of physical activity may be enough to protect the aging brain, the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We summarize research that clearly indicates that exercise is not only important for the heart, but also for the brain. Physical activity appears to be one of the most promising measures we have to prevent cognitive decline and dementia,” Tari said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slows down aging processes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article evaluated evidence from both animal and human studies, and shows how physical activity affects inflammation, blood flow, immune function, brain plasticity and the release of protective molecules in the blood – processes that weaken with age and contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are mechanisms that play an important role in the development of dementia and cognitive decline,” Tari said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tari and Wisløff are researchers at the Cardiac Exercise Research Group (CERG) at NTNU, and have previously promoted the idea that microtraining – going from no activity to incorporating small doses of pulse training into everyday life – be included in the recommendations from Norwegian health authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the recommendation is at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of high intensity per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fully 50 to 70 per cent of the population does not manage today’s activity recommendations, Wisløff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small doses – high intensity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers point out that exercising much less than what the current recommendations recommend can provide great benefits – as long as the intensity of the training is high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tari and Wisløff believe that this new study makes it even more important to get the message out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe it’s time for health authorities to provide clearer advice on how important exercise is for the brain. Our review shows that even small doses of high-intensity activity – equivalent to brisk walking where you can’t sing – can reduce the risk of dementia by up to 40 per cent,” Wisløff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never too late to start&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International research supports the NTNU researchers’ findings. In a commentary in Nature Medicine in January, American researchers argued that public guidelines need to be updated. Even small doses of physical activity provide health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today’s recommendations emphasize total activity, but we show that even small amounts of high intensity exercise have an effect on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This should be communicated more clearly – it may be what motivates people to get started. A little is better than nothing – and it’s never too late to start,” says Tari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As life expectancy increases, cognitive decline and dementia are becoming a major public health challenge. Since there is still no cure, prevention is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise is cheap, accessible and has no side effects. It should be considered a first-line measure to preserve brain health,” Tari said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this exercise and brain aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ingebjørg Hestvik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NTNU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ingebjørg Hestvik – NTNU&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)00184-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroprotective mechanisms of exercise and the importance of fitness for healthy brain ageing&lt;/a&gt;” by Atefe R.

								&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been keeping an eye on &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/01/08/fearing-another-pandemic-people-are-prepping-for-bird-flu-should-you/" target="_blank"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; ever since it was first discovered nearly 30 years ago. Experts have long recognized that the H5N1 virus that causes the disease has &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00238-X/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;pandemic potential&lt;/a&gt;, just like COVID-19 or swine flu. In the past three years, outbreaks of bird flu, formally called highly pathogenic avian influenza, in wild animals spilled over to dairy cows and poultry, infecting several dozen humans and even killing one American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each human and mammalian infection gives the virus an opportunity to mutate and evolve better ways of transmitting from person to person — a key benchmark for what makes a pathogen a pandemic-level threat. And numerous &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ame91llKsyc" target="_blank"&gt;headlines&lt;/a&gt; and scientific publications have &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adw3278" target="_blank"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that we're inching closer and closer to just such a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the last couple weeks have been relatively quiet. Other than the report of a child death from H5N1 bird flu in Durango, Mexico on April 8, and of another child, in India's Andhra Pradesh state, who died March 15, there has been seemingly little in the news about H5N1 bird flu. H5N1 has become prevalent in wild birds but also spread to infect mammals on every continent, &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/avian-flu-is-rapidly-spreading-across-antarctica-180986222/" target="_blank"&gt;even Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the odd human, although mammal-to-mammal transmission remains limited and human-to-human transmission has not been seen — yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've actually had a very active H5N1 year, and a lot of outbreaks in the U.S. in wildlife."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;tracking the outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;, but their online dashboard has updated little in the last several weeks. Statistics for human cases have remained unchanged since the start of the year, when an elderly resident of Louisiana became &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/01/06/first-us-from-bird-flu-reported-in-louisiana/" target="_blank"&gt;the first human to die of H5N1 bird flu in the United States&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the CDC says that there have been 70 US human cases, and that number seems to not have changed either, despite recent testing of a child in San Francisco who was found to have H5N1 bird flu, and a recent case in Ohio. But experts say the mysteriously static numbers should not be cause for relief, but rather for creeping unease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ask computational biologist Martha Nelson, a staff scientist at the National Institutes of Health, it hasn't been a quiet year for bird flu. Not at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So I can tell you on the wildlife side, we've actually had a very active H5N1 year, and a lot of outbreaks in the U.S. in wildlife," she told Salon in a video interview. "The virus is certainly not going away ... you know, it's certainly still evolving rapidly, picking up new genome segments from the low pathogenicity viruses that are endemic in the Americas that are not found in Eurasia, so opening all these new avenues for evolution."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New avenues for evolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Agriculture continues to log confirmed reports of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry flocks, and a quick look at its tracker confirms that there is &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks" target="_blank"&gt;a hell of a lot of bird flu out there&lt;/a&gt;. It can be difficult keeping track of all the different short forms used to distinguish one genotype from another so scientists can keep track as the virus evolves. Even the researchers Salon spoke with had to double-check different names during our conversation, so there's no shame in getting them confused. But these seemingly minor genetic differences can actually have a big impact on how the virus infects people and how severe the illness becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first case of H5N1 in cattle back in Texas in March of last year &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq0900" target="_blank"&gt;involved the genotype B3.13&lt;/a&gt;. But D1.1 and D1.3 are the genotypes that have been more recently sweeping across the United States. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON564#:~:text=On%2013%20March%2C%20the%20case,April%20due%20to%20respiratory%20complications." target="_blank"&gt;The child who died in Mexico&lt;/a&gt; contracted D1.1 (it's not clear how it was acquired and none of the child's contacts seem to have been infected.) The teenager in Canada last November who &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/387/bmj.q2529" target="_blank"&gt;survived a very serious case of H5N1 bird flu&lt;/a&gt; thanks to intensive treatment — which would be likely impossible to roll out at scale in the case of a full-blown pandemic — also had the D1.1 genotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Those genotypes seem to be very prevalent in wildlife and wild birds, and then spilling over onto poultry farms," Nelson said. "The H5N1 challenge: it's always present, it's just coming in slightly different forms."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the D1.1 and D1.3 genotypes making their way into commercial poultry operations, D1.1 has spilled over into cattle multiple times, offering new opportunities for humans to become infected. The &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/program-update/aphis-confirms-d11-genotype-dairy-cattle-nevada-0" target="_blank"&gt;Nevada outbreak in dairy cows in January&lt;/a&gt; (and the dairy worker &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/08/health/bird-flu-variant-nevada-human-case/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;who in February&lt;/a&gt; became the state's first human case) and the Arizona outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/third-avian-flu-spillover-reported-arizona-dairy-herd-raw-pet-food-sickens#:~:text=for%20Priority%20Pathogens-,Third%20avian%20flu%20spillover%20reported%20in%20Arizona%20dairy%20herd,pet%20food%20sickens%20Oregon%20cats&amp;amp;text=For%20the%20second%20time%20in,herd%20in%20Arizona's%20Maricopa%20County." target="_blank"&gt;identified through national milk testing in February&lt;/a&gt;, for example, were D1.1, a hybrid virus created from the already-prevalent low pathogenic influenza virus trading genetic material with highly pathogenic avian flu virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That [the emergence of D.1.1 in cattle made us think] it doesn't seem quiet on our end, because we all thought [the B3.13] spillover into cattle was kind of a fluke. Like, that's a one-off thing, like that's never going to happen again," Nelson said. "And what we're seeing through bulk milk surveillance is that actually, spillover is happening. Whenever you have these pulses in H5N1 activity in wildlife, it's spilling over into cattle."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bulk milk surveillance program is the only way we know what is going on with cattle, and it's vital (even though there is an inherent testing bias, in that not all milk is tested and we may assume that if sporadic and random testing doesn't turn up H5N1, that means it's not there, an assumption that may well be incorrect.) Bulk milk surveillance is the main component of the National Milk Testing Strategy, which late in 2024 set out a roadmap for states to follow to eliminate H5N1 bird flu from cattle. But the program is voluntary, being rolled out state by state in an unclear way (according to the USDA's weekly report of April 25, &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/livestock/nmts" target="_blank"&gt;45 states are currently enrolled&lt;/a&gt; in the program.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the USDA writes on its website that "the National Milk Testing Strategy (NMTS) establishes a structured, uniform and mandatory testing system that supports the December 2024 Federal Order", the uniformity and structure are debatable, given that much of surveillance is "state-specific" and a problem before the federal order was that &lt;a href="http://National%20Milk%20Testing%20Strategy%20(NMTS)%20establishes%20a%20structured,%20uniform,%20and%20mandatory%20testing%20system%20that%20supports%20the%20December%202024%20Federal%20Order" target="_blank"&gt;farmers refused to provide milk for testing&lt;/a&gt;: while the federal order requires they now provide milk for testing when asked, it's not clear how this is enforced or how different states choose where and how aggressively to test. And the Food and Drug Administration recently &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/fda-suspends-program-improve-bird-flu-testing-due-staff-cuts-2025-04-03/" target="_blank"&gt;halted work to improve bird flu testing of milk&lt;/a&gt; due to staffing cuts, and, even more alarming, last week announced the agency was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-suspends-milk-quality-tests-amid-workforce-cuts-2025-04-21/" target="_blank"&gt;suspending quality testing of the highest quality of fluid raw milk&lt;/a&gt; for the same reason, though it has claimed that this is a temporary pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for human cases, "in the U.S., there has been almost no reporting of new cases," virologist Angela Rasmussen told Salon. "I'm positive that this is because they are not monitoring people who are getting infected, and there are far fewer tests being performed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen is an American based in Canada, where she teaches at the University of Saskatchewan and is a research scientist at the &lt;a href="https://www.vido.org" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine and Infectious Disease Research Organization-International Vaccine Centre&lt;/a&gt;. She blames funding cuts and mass layoffs since the start of the current administration for the reduction in monitoring. USDA staff involved in national laboratory testing to confirm cases of H5N1 and other animal diseases were laid off early on in the mass federal layoffs recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, but by late February the Associated Press reported that &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/usda-firings-doge-bird-flu-trump-fdd6495cbe44c96d471ae8c6cf4dd0a8" target="_blank"&gt;the agency was scrambling to rehire them&lt;/a&gt;. But later cuts and layoffs at the CDC, FDA and the NIH, as well as at the USDA, including at APHIS, have all affected data sharing between states and the federal government as well as uniformity of testing and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Atmosphere of complete chaos"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen also blames certain policies of the Trump administration less obviously related to monitoring for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One, there are fewer resources in general being put towards surveillance, monitoring and testing, and two, given that a significant proportion of the dairy agriculture workers who are likely to be most at risk of exposure are undocumented, and they are very strongly disincentivized to seek out testing when the result of that could be being expatriated and sent potentially to a prison in El Salvador," Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in February, Salon reported that immigrant and especially &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/02/09/migrants-are-on-the-front-lines-of-the-bird-flu-but-deportation-fears-are-causing-chaos/" target="_blank"&gt;undocumented workers&lt;/a&gt; are in closest contact with cows, most likely to notice concerning symptoms in herds and to become infected themselves, and less likely to get regular flu vaccines, which puts them at greater risk of incubating new variants. This is because regular influenza can trade genetic material with H5N1 bird flu in the event of co-infection. But as Rasmussen said, the reasons to not draw any attention from the feds have only increased, even for workers whose papers are in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The USDA has not really done anything, from what I can tell, to even address the cattle outbreak when they put out their new avian [bird] flu strategy," Rasmussen noted. "It basically only dealt with the poultry outbreaks, and that strategy relies pretty heavily on improving biosecurity, so making sure that people are not bringing the virus to and from different farms with them, making sure that wild birds can't access poultry houses." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She notes that both the USDA and the CDC are less forthcoming with information than they were previously, including about the biosecurity audits run by USDA that, according to the new plan, must be carried out by USDA staff in order for farmers to be compensated for outbreaks on their farms that require culling of birds. Hundreds of USDA staff members were &lt;a href="https://investigatemidwest.org/2025/04/24/after-forcing-resignations-usda-tries-to-walk-back-staff-cuts-and-calls-frontline-workers-vital/" target="_blank"&gt;forced out over recent months&lt;/a&gt; and it's unclear whether the staff needed to perform these audits actually exist at the agency anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My bigger problem with that entire plan is really three things," Rasmussen continued. "They barely even mentioned the cattle outbreak, and we know that the cows have actually given the virus back to birds, so that's one mechanism, potentially, for that cow virus to continue being transmitted to other species." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Nelson, Rasmussen feels that the discovery of D1.1 genotype bird flu in cows was a watershed moment. "It was really distressing when those D1.1 genotype cases were found in cows, because it seemed like for the past year that this was a really rare event," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen said that the Canadian equivalent to the USDA, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, continues to test both retail and tank milk and has not found any positives in the country. Still, while before the D1.1 discovery there was speculation that local differences in policy — feeding poultry litter to cows as they do in Texas, or the much bigger size of dairy operations in the U.S. — might have contributed to greater susceptibility to the disease spilling over from birds to cows. Now it seems that, as Rasmussen said, "it could happen anywhere, if there's the opportunity for birds to interface with the cows, which is why they should have controlled the cow outbreak a long time ago. And if they had taken more aggressive action in March or April of 2024 I think we might be in a very different position right now," she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most critical issue is that we know there's H5N1 bird flu in cows, but we don't know how many cows are currently infected in the U.S., and it's unlikely that we have an accurate count of human cases. The same goes for pigs — a single case was &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/11/01/bird-flu-detected-in-pigs-for-first-time-as-confirmed-human-cases-double-in-two-weeks/" target="_blank"&gt;found among five backyard pigs in October&lt;/a&gt; in a non-commercial operation where swine mixed with poultry and other livestock. While it didn't spread, pigs are considered especially worrisome among mammalian vectors of bird flu because they harbor many influenza viruses that can co-exist with it, swapping genetic material, and because they are generally kept in close quarters and with proximity to humans, and because pigs have receptors in their respiratory tract that would allow them to be simultaneously infected with &lt;a href="https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1746-6148-6-4" target="_blank"&gt;a bird and a human influenza&lt;/a&gt; virus, allowing for exchange of the genetic material that might allow H5N1 bird flu to acquire the very few mutations still needed to allow for it to spread readily between humans. And yet there appears to be no specific monitoring or testing of pork processing or swine-raising facilities at all. As the industry publication &lt;a href="https://www.pigprogress.net/market-trends-analysis-the-industrymarkets/us-pork-processing-preparations-underway-for-mass-deportations-of-illegal-workers/" target="_blank"&gt;Pig Progress noted in December&lt;/a&gt;, such facilities depend heavily on the very undocumented labor being targeted for mass deportations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would we know if a suspicious cluster of human cases, that could represent the first sustained human-to-human transmission of the disease, were happening? Perhaps not. What's not clear though is whether the problem is lack of data or lack of transparency about the data. Rasmussen's suggestion was that the necessary monitoring was not happening in the United States. But she also noted that the &lt;a href="https://www.wsaz.com/2025/02/07/weekly-cdc-report-returns-omits-bird-flu/" target="_blank"&gt;CDC withheld publication of certain H5N1 studies&lt;/a&gt; in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report for a couple of weeks, reportedly, she said, for political reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So I do think it's possible that there is H5N1 data that's being collected and being suppressed, but I don't know." But, she speculated, "it may not be that that information is being intentionally concealed, but it may be that there's just not enough people to actually get this information into a form that would be releasable to the public."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influenza division at the CDC lots staff to probationary firings as well as on Valentine's Day when further staff were fired en masse. "And so my understanding, at least from people within the CDC who work closely with the influenza division, is that it lost a lot of people, but also the people who are still there, there's just this atmosphere of complete chaos ... They're trying to do the same amount of work with fewer resources." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second problem with the new avian flu plan is, in Rasmussen's view, that it doesn't even really acknowledge that a vaccine was conditionally approved in February and early March, nor mention using it to prevent infection in poultry, which would help to limit spread and reduce the chances of a more human-adapted variant emerging. Vaccines have been effective in China and Vietnam and Egypt for quelling outbreaks. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14575101/#:~:text=The%20avian%20influenza%20high%2Dpathogenicity,reliable%20monitoring%20program%20for%20AI." target="_blank"&gt;In Mexico, an outbreak of H5N2&lt;/a&gt;, a different form of bird flu, was successfully controlled in the 1990s, and quite quickly, by vaccination along with culling and controls on poultry movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our bovine [cow] outbreak, we haven't taken that route," Nelson noted. "And that's largely because there's trade implications if you vaccinate." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when the French began to vaccinate ducks for H5N1, the U.S. and other countries &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-canada-ease-ban-french-poultry-imposed-after-bird-flu-vaccination-2025-01-20/" target="_blank"&gt;banned imports&lt;/a&gt; of their H5N1-free poultry. Then again, Nelson noted that using a vaccine effectively entails other activities: there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the possibility of silent transmission and accelerating evolution through vaccines that are not perfect matches to the circulating strains of the virus. Intensive biological monitoring is required, and for exports to be protected, you need a global system for transparent sharing of data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a big policy question that would be very helpful to establish going forward," Nelson said. On whether it might be a challenging time for creating such a global system for transparently sharing information, Nelson said only, "no comment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cruel and ineffective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The third thing," according to Rasmussen, "is that that plan mentions that they would like to reduce the amount of culling that happens in avian outbreaks."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this last point, Rasmussen grimaced, pointing out that health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed not culling birds stricken with the disease, suggesting that we might identify naturally immune chickens by letting it spread unchecked. Essentially the idea, for which the secretary of agriculture Brooke Rollins has also voiced support, seems to be that survivors might become super chickens with innate resistance to bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But highly pathogenic avian influenza is aptly named because of what it does to birds, including chickens. There is no innate resistance. Rasmussen said that it has an essentially 100% mortality rate: "You will not have surviving chickens that are likely to be super resistant chickens. You're not likely to have any surviving at all. And pathogenesis of flu in birds, in chickens is really, really gruesome, and it presents a huge risk for anybody who would have to clean up after just sort of letting it go. Flu in birds is gastrointestinal and well as respiratory. So, I mean, you're talking about birds convulsing, bloody diarrhea, bloody vomit. A lot of really gross stuff. A lot of really terrible suffering for those animals. And a really dangerous situation where you have potentially hundreds of thousands of bird carcasses that are loaded with high titre H5N1 virus."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/php/avian-flu-summary/h5n1-human-infections.html" target="_blank"&gt;probable cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, including H5N1&lt;/a&gt; — but, crucially, not the same H5N1 that is circulating now — being passed from one human to another in a very limited way. No such cases have been reported in the United States. And so far, there is no evidence that the current H5N1 bird flu can be transmitted from one human to another. Nevertheless, scientists believe it's only a matter of time, or time plus opportunity for the virus to evolve the necessary mutations — before a version that is well-adapted to humans begins to show human-to-human infection in a sustained way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mammalian adaption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm a cat person, so I'm intrigued by this," said Nelson, when asked about the risk to or from cats from H5N1 bird flu. "Cats kind of fall [off] the radar because they're not livestock, they're not USDA, so there's no kind of dedicated funding for studying cats." They don't fall under the purview of the USDA, nor within the purview of the NIH, which focuses on human health. "So far, we've seen all these different routes by which cats can get infected." Barn cats have been infected by drinking H5N1-infected milk that splatters around during the milking process. House cats have also been &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/02/12/cats-with-bird-flu-could-pose-a-risk-to-public-health_partner/" target="_blank"&gt;infected through frozen raw pet food&lt;/a&gt; — the virus survives very well in freezers, Nelson noted. And there are cases that are suspected to have resulted from outdoor cats that play with or scavenge infected or dead birds. Finally, there was a cat that appears to have been infected by its owner, a dairy farm worker, possibly just through virus on his clothing. "It just shows how complicated this disease system is, that something as simple as a house cat can get infected four different ways," Nelson said. Cats are highly susceptible to the virus, and infection with it is &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-h5n1-cats" target="_blank"&gt;very serious and frequently fatal in cats&lt;/a&gt;. By contrast the threat to humans from cats who pick up the virus is currently considered low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A December analysis published &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt0180" target="_blank"&gt;in Science showed that a single mutation&lt;/a&gt; in the genes coding for the protein hemagglutinin in H5N1 bird flu virus in cows could be enough to change the virus' receptor specificity, which still favors birds, to target humans. Hemagglutinin, which is the H part of the virus' name and is related to severity of infection, is attached to the surface of the virus, helping it get into cells. A switch from glutamine to leucinein resulting from just one mutation could switch the virus from being able to easily bind to avian, or bird, receptors to favouring human receptors in the respiratory tract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I would suspect," Nelson said, "That for every [human] infection we detect there's a great deal more that are just undiagnosed." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These would mostly be among people with occupational exposure, like workers in the pork, beef and poultry industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Just because people aren't hearing about H5N1 in the news, just because there isn't some massive outbreak with lots of human cases [doesn't mean it's gone away]. For scientists, this is just kind of an ongoing problem, that just continues to escalate in its complexity," said Nelson, noting the emergence of D1.1, of new human cases, of continued outbreaks in wildlife and of transmission through pet food. "You know, this problem is staying with us for the near future, probably long term. And I think that's what really alarms people ... Just that we don't seem to have a strategy to contain this over the long term."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When or if that happens, we'll be at the start of a pandemic that could make COVID-19 look mild in comparison, though of course anyone with long COVID will say it's very far from just a cold. Speaking of COVID, that pandemic may have waned lately, but &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home" target="_blank"&gt;tens of thousands of infections still occur weekly&lt;/a&gt;, as well as several hundred deaths. And we're always just one nasty mutation — something the SARS-CoV-2 virus has done countless times — away from another major resurgence of COVID. Coupled with the return of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/03/11/you-dont-want-to-throw-a-measles-party/" target="_blank"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/02/21/tuberculosis-is-on-the-rise-again-we-can-fight-it--if-we-try/" target="_blank"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; and more, H5N1 is likely just another of symptom of the erosion of public health and trust in science. We need to monitor and study it — to understand it — if we want to keep it at bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, their newly developed AI model may improve diagnostics in &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By recognising patterns from previous patients, the model can determine whether a patient has the relapsing-remitting form or whether the disease has transitioned to secondary progressive MS,” Kim Kultima, PhD, the study’s senior author and a professor at Uppsala University in Sweden, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/en/press/press-releases/2025/2025-04-28-new-ai-model-improves-ms-diagnostics"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per the study team: “We present here a first-of-its-kind predictive model that is able to distinguish between RRMS and SPMS at high accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team noted that “the gradual transition” among patients from RRMS to SPMS “is often diagnosed retrospectively with a typical delay of three years.” This new model has the potential “to distinguish between RRMS and SPMS at each individual [doctor] visit,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study “&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01616-z"&gt;Conformal prediction enables disease course prediction and allows individualized diagnostic uncertainty in multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;npj Digital Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Researchers use AI tool to develop predictive model for MS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people with multiple sclerosis initially develop RRMS, which is marked by &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-flares/"&gt;relapses&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; worsen, interspersed with periods of remission when symptoms ease. Over time, many people with RRMS will transition to SPMS — characterized by symptoms that get gradually worse over time irrespective of relapse activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing the transition from RRMS to SPMS is important because these two &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/4-types-ms/"&gt;MS types&lt;/a&gt; have distinct responses to the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapies&lt;/a&gt; now available to patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Proactive recognition of patients with progressive disease could limit exposure to ineffective medications and their side effects,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, however, there are no solid criteria defining the transition between disease types. Usually such diagnoses are made by looking at how a patient’s symptoms have changed from previous years. As such, patients generally are not diagnosed with SPMS until they’ve already been living with this type of MS for several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve MS diagnoses, Kultima and colleagues set out to create a machine learning tool to detect the transition from RRMS to SPMS based on data collected from patients at routine checkups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is a form of AI that uses mathematical rules called algorithms to analyze a large set of data, learn from its analyses, and make predictions based on the learned patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build the model, the researchers used data from more than 22,000 people with MS, collected between 1972 and 2022, in the Swedish MS Registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from most of the patients was used to train, validate, and calibrate the machine learning tool, and data from the remaining 3,595 patients was used to subsequently test it. The test dataset comprised 2,451 people with RRMS, 677 with SPMS, and 467 who had an initial RRMS diagnosis but then transitioned to SPMS during follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;In 26% of cases, model ID’d MS transition earlier than doctors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the new model overall was 92.1% accurate at discriminating between RRMS and SPMS at a given hospital visit. The model also correctly predicted an initial RRMS diagnosis and a later transition to SPMS in 68.5% of the 467 patients who experienced such transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more than half of these cases, the tool identified the switch from RRMS to SPMS at almost exactly the same time as patients’ records changed. Moreover, in 26.6% of cases, the model identified the switch at an earlier hospital visit than doctors had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For patients, this means that the diagnosis can be made earlier, which makes it possible to adjust the patient’s treatment in time and slow down the progression of the disease,” Kultima said. “This also reduces the risk of patients receiving medicines that are no longer effective.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;What is unique about the model is that it also indicates how confident it is in each individual assessment. … This means that the doctor will know how reliable the conclusion is and how confident the AI is in its assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to identifying which type of MS the patient has, the machine learning tool includes conformal prediction — basically, a way for the computer to report how certain it is that its labeling is correct for each patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is unique about the model is that it also indicates how confident it is in each individual assessment,” Kultima said. “This means that the doctor will know how reliable the conclusion is and how confident the AI is in its assessment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers have made a version of their tool &lt;a href="https://msp-tracker.serve.scilifelab.se/"&gt;publicly available online&lt;/a&gt; so that other researchers and clinicians can explore its utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the long term, the model could also be used to identify suitable participants for clinical trials – which could contribute to more effective and individualised treatment strategies,” Kultima said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Multiple Sclerosis News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:41:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxQYXphVENXZHZ1Sk9FVUQwZWdTNlZDWU1rbmxrRDZsS1l0UVoxQnBNRkNHTUJFbFplV2plZzdDdEN2NWVJWnhFbzFYQkc0b1RoSXA5UzF3cWlMWU5MdEZ2N2pxaXM4Z0VCa2x3U3hpNGdJa3RzMm5EVFNyRmd6RUxHUGxrYmNCRC1UTTZxUF9KVnpvN01EWklwRDR3QTl1QjZYU25kVkg0X3B0cE5idjhqN3h2SC1OOVU1emc</guid></item><item><title>科学家首次在实验室中成功培养人类牙齿- Earth.com | Scientists successfully grow human teeth in a laboratory for the first time - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNdkpPNzAwUFFKdXcwMVpSdEdYdGZRWGVYQUQybU1YdVdoOGZnQjlzT2xQcnplNDFvSEJvbDd2ei10ZHVmQkVkdEJUbVpCYlQwOFkzNXR5bVRNNWNfOFlEUXZtV0tibWtzY0ZjTFhKWUJxT0czMzJfX0lUMmZNWjluVExoeG0tQWlZaUhocEpjMi0xdmR6dHJmRlpLZlhhTEUyc2x6Z01n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans have long accepted that we get one replacement set of teeth after our baby ones. The idea of sprouting another tooth by simply taking a pill has sounded like pure science fiction in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dentinova.co.uk/2025/02/26/dr-katsu-takahashi-a-visionary-in-teeth-regeneration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katsu Takahashi&lt;/a&gt; and his team at the Medical Research Institute Kitano Hospital in Osaka, Japan, have been exploring the possibility of helping people grow new teeth. The clinical trial began in July 2024 in hopes of making the treatment publicly available by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-missing-teeth-and-protein"&gt;Missing teeth and protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24168-anodontia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anodontia&lt;/a&gt; rate of around &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0528.2004.00158.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;1%&lt;/a&gt; of the general population presents a problem for those who cannot develop a complete set of permanent teeth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This condition can affect speech and eating from an early age. Traditional treatments often involve dentures or dental implants, but these approaches can carry inconveniences for young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe the new therapy could help children aged 2 to 6 who lack adult teeth. They are examining a way to block a protein linked with limiting tooth growth in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protein-blocking-breakthrough"&gt;Protein blocking breakthrough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, scientists discovered that the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf1798" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;USAG-1 protein&lt;/a&gt; plays a direct role in regulating the development of new teeth. When this protein is active, it can prevent additional teeth from forming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By crafting a medication to neutralize it, Takahashi’s team encouraged animals to grow teeth beyond their normal sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested their medication on mice with missing teeth. They observed tooth development in those mice where none had grown before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-discovery-matters"&gt;Why the discovery matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people are born with two sets of teeth. Yet some animals – like sharks – regrow many sets as needed. Scientists once believed humans did not have any spare tooth buds beyond baby and adult teeth, but evidence now suggests we have a latent third set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea of growing new teeth is every dentist’s dream. I’ve been working on this since I was a graduate student. I was confident I’d be able to make it happen,” said Takahashi. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some individuals show a tendency toward &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/hyperdontia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hyperdontia&lt;/a&gt;, which means they form extra teeth. One in three such cases involves growth of a third set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-animal-research-on-protein-and-teeth"&gt;Animal research on protein and teeth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32922570/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; paved the way for studies in ferrets. The medication spurred the growth of an extra front tooth, suggesting that ferrets – like mice – possess the capacity for additional sets. It showed that what was once dormant could be nudged into action with the right approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasize the potential impact for those with tooth agenesis, another term for missing teeth. Many with missing teeth struggle from an early age due to problems with speech and chewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-potential-human-benefits"&gt;Potential human benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials in humans will aim to confirm the therapy’s safety. Takahashi believes an added set of teeth might someday become a realistic option for those who have lost teeth or never formed them in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In any case, we’re hoping to see a time when tooth-regrowth medicine is a third choice alongside dentures and implants,” said Takahashi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentists typically turn to implants or dentures, which require maintenance and can be uncomfortable. The proposed medication seeks to offer a biological alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-challenges-on-the-road-ahead"&gt;Challenges on the road ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe human testing remains a key goal. Regulatory reviews will be crucial to confirm there are no adverse effects. The team hopes that in six years, regrowing teeth for therapeutic purposes will be a common procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research in genetics has opened possibilities for medicine that once seemed too ambitious. Understanding how to spur a new set of teeth is a major step in combining genetics and dentistry for practical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shaping-the-future-of-dentistry"&gt;Shaping the future of dentistry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists around the world have been intrigued by similar regenerative procedures. Some labs study &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/154405910408300703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, while others explore chemical triggers for tooth development. The search for a viable therapy has been active for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takahashi’s approach hinges on a well-defined protein target. If successful, it might also encourage the development of treatments for other dental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-it-works"&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medication contains an antibody designed to block USAG-1. When that happens, tooth buds have fewer barriers stopping them from maturing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By directing the body’s &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/what-happens-to-our-teeth-as-we-age-new-details-have-emerged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;natural growth process&lt;/a&gt;, researchers aim to produce strong and fully formed teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hope is that those who never had a complete set can finally grow a replacement. Many doctors see it as a potential game-changer in oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signs-of-optimism"&gt;Signs of optimism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, missing teeth lead to lifelong issues. Families handle multiple rounds of dental visits for children in need of prosthetics or implants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these trials confirm the safety and effectiveness of the therapy, the days of coping with artificial replacements might become less common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the journey from mouse studies to human trials can be long, Takahashi’s team is excited about the milestone. They view their discovery as a chance to rewrite what is possible for tooth restoration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead"&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research community will watch these clinical trials in Japan to see if the technique can be reliably repeated in people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it works, it may shape a future where anyone could regrow a natural tooth. That prospect alone has generated plenty of curiosity and interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:33:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNdkpPNzAwUFFKdXcwMVpSdEdYdGZRWGVYQUQybU1YdVdoOGZnQjlzT2xQcnplNDFvSEJvbDd2ei10ZHVmQkVkdEJUbVpCYlQwOFkzNXR5bVRNNWNfOFlEUXZtV0tibWtzY0ZjTFhKWUJxT0czMzJfX0lUMmZNWjluVExoeG0tQWlZaUhocEpjMi0xdmR6dHJmRlpLZlhhTEUyc2x6Z01n</guid></item><item><title>一名潜水员参观了一条堕落的鲸鱼。当他回来时，它已经消失了。-《纽约时报》 | A Diver Visited a Fallen Whale.

As he descended, a hulking mass took shape below him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;There, at an exceptionally shallow 115 feet, lay the body of a baby gray whale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Whale falls are usually not seen by human divers. Typically, they are discovered by remotely operated vehicles at depths exceeding 3,000 feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Local marine biologists had a guess as to the gray whale calf’s origins. An animal that matched what was found on the seafloor had been spotted swimming near La Jolla Shores, desperately searching for its mother. During its final hours, it was seen approaching boats, as though asking for help that wasn’t coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Because it was the first time in memory that a fall was so accessible to people, other divers quickly made their way to the site. Among them was Jules Jacobs, an underwater photojournalist who &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/science/tuna-crabs-san-diego.html" title=""&gt;has written&lt;/a&gt; for The New York Times about his explorations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;At that point in late January, the carcass’s resting place was a trough in the canyon that required pinpoint precision to reach.

Inattention and anxiety appear to reinforce each other in girls, but not in boys, where hyperactivity is the more predictive factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasize that these findings could improve early diagnosis and intervention for young girls, who are often overlooked due to their quiet or daydreamy demeanor. Early support may prevent later mental health issues, offering a path toward more targeted, sex-specific approaches to ADHD care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Inattention predicts anxiety in girls, while hyperactivity predicts it in boys.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Undiagnosed ADHD:&lt;/strong&gt; Girls with inattentive-type ADHD are often diagnosed late due to subtler symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Intervention:&lt;/strong&gt; Identifying inattention before age 12 could prevent anxiety later on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NTNU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) have found new correlations between ADHD and anxiety, which are two major health issues among adolescents. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two disorders often co-occur in individuals, and recent findings now reveal that the relationship between them appears to be different in girls and boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109382"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a girl and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The NTNU researchers hope their findings can demonstrate the importance of early detection of ADHD in children. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apparent differences between girls and boys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several types of ADHD, and the researchers’ findings are related to one specific type called the &lt;em&gt;inattentive type&lt;/em&gt;. A higher percentage of girls have this type of ADHD. Boys often have a different type of ADHD called the &lt;em&gt;hyperactive-impulsive type&lt;/em&gt;. Some people can have both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First and foremost, we have identified a link between anxiety and inattentive type ADHD, and we find that this only applies to girls,” said Professor Lars Wichstrøm at the Department of Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprised by major differences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first time researchers have investigated – and demonstrated – that the relationship between ADHD and anxiety differs according to sex, and that it is linked to inattention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We assumed there were differences between the sexes, but we did not expect them to be so significant,” said Wichstrøm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasizes that they have studied inattention as a symptom of ADHD, rather than ADHD as a disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reciprocal relationship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two disorders seem to reinforce each other. In girls, the prevalence of inattention increases the likelihood of more severe symptoms of anxiety disorders during childhood and adolescence. In addition, anxiety during adolescence increases the likelihood of the inattention worsening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found no such correlation between inattention and anxiety in boys. However, they found that increased hyperactivity-impulsivity in the first few years of school increased the likelihood of developing anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earlier detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders increase significantly during adolescence, especially for girls. The NTNU study concludes that early detection and effective treatment of inattention symptoms in girls can reduce the risk of anxiety later on in life. Similarly, interventions or treatment for anxiety can reduce the likelihood of attention deficit difficulties becoming more severe in young girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is well known that ADHD and anxiety often co-occur in individuals. According to Wichstrøm, only a small part of this comorbidity can be explained by shared genetics between ADHD and anxiety. We also know that the intensity of ADHD symptoms and anxiety can vary over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we do not know why this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under the radar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, 5 per cent of children and adolescents have ADHD, both in Norway and in other countries where this has been studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety increases significantly in children as early as 12 years old. If we can identify inattention problems before that age, possibly as early as 8 years old, we may be able to reduce or prevent them from developing into anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Girls with inattentive type ADHD are often perceived as shy, introverted, absent-minded and daydreaming – or even lazy. As children, they often go under the radar because they rarely cause any trouble or disturb others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only symptom they have is inattention, and it can be difficult to distinguish this from simply being ‘normally’ distracted, disorganized, or forgetful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missing out on help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that girls often receive the diagnosis later on in life. As a result, they miss out on interventions that might help limit the later development of anxiety, according to Wichstrøm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyperactive-impulsive type ADHD is most prevalent in boys. It is easier to see and hear individuals who struggle with restlessness and hyperactivity, who cannot sit still or wait their turn. Thus, they tend to be identified earlier, receive a diagnosis, and get help more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Struggle and exclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children who struggle with basic skills can experience exclusion, bullying and other stressful challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Personal and social challenges can easily lead to rumination, worry, anxiety and catastrophizing. It seems that girls are more vulnerable when they are exposed to negative life events or bullying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are more likely to respond with depression than boys,” explained Wichstrøm, who has done extensive research on anxiety and depression among adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADHD is detected through anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers still do not know if there are any common factors underlying and influencing why some individuals develop both anxiety and ADHD. What they do know is that the older an individual is when diagnosed, the more common it is for them to have inattentive type ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generally, as young people approach puberty, the prevalence of anxiety increases significantly – especially among girls, and it is only at that point that their ADHD is also detected,” explained Wichstrøm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking for early signs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NTNU researchers hope their findings can demonstrate the importance of early detection of ADHD in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anxiety increases significantly in children as early as 12 years old. If we can identify inattention problems before that age, possibly as young as 8 years old, we may be able to reduce or prevent them from developing into anxiety,” said Wichstrøm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NTNU researchers emphasize the need for more knowledge about the intricate connections between sex, ADHD and anxiety. An additional step could be to confirm the findings they have made in an even larger study. Wichstrøm would like to see further research on the very youngest girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping people with ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wichstrøm is fully aware of the debate about the overdiagnosis of ADHD. He says it is quite possible that too many people may end up with a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But we must still strive to actually detect ADHD where it exists and help those who have it,” he said.Studied 1000 children and their parents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NTNU study is an observational study. It is based on information from 1000 children born in 2003 and 2004 and their parents. The participants have been followed up every other year from the time the children were 4 years old until they turned 18. They are now young adults, turning 22 this autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this ADHD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lars Wichstrøm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NTNU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lars Wichstrøm – NTNU&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.14038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reciprocal relations between dimensions of attention-deficit/hyperactivity and anxiety disorders from preschool age to adolescence: sex differences in a birth cohort sample&lt;/a&gt;” by Lars Wichstrøm et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reciprocal relations between dimensions of attention-deficit/hyperactivity and anxiety disorders from preschool age to adolescence: sex differences in a birth cohort sample&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jcpp14038-sec-0001-title"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are prospectively related from childhood to adolescence. However, whether the two dimensions of ADHD—inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity—are differentially related to anxiety and whether there are developmental and sex/gender differences in these relations are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jcpp14038-sec-0002-title"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two birth cohorts of Norwegian children were assessed biennially from ages 4 to 16 (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 1,077; 49% girls) with diagnostic parent interviews used to assess symptoms of anxiety and ADHD. Data were analyzed using a random intercept cross-lagged panel model, adjusting for all unobserved time-invariant confounding effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jcpp14038-sec-0003-title"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In girls, increased inattention, but not hyperactivity-impulsivity, predicted increased anxiety 2 years later across all time-points and increased anxiety at ages 12 and 14 predicted increased inattention but not hyperactivity-impulsivity. In boys, increased hyperactivity-impulsivity at ages 6 and 8, but not increased inattention, predicted increased anxiety 2 years later, whereas increased anxiety did not predict increased inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jcpp14038-sec-0004-title"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two ADHD dimensions were differentially related to anxiety, and the relations were sex-specific. In girls, inattention may be involved in the development of anxiety throughout childhood and adolescence and anxiety may contribute to girls developing more inattention beginning in early adolescence. In boys, hyperactivity-impulsivity may be involved in the development of anxiety during the early school years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective treatment of inattention symptoms in girls may reduce anxiety risk at all time-points, while addressing anxiety may decrease inattention during adolescence. Similarly, treating hyperactivity-impulsivity may reduce anxiety risk in boys during late childhood (at ages 8–10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:29:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE85RHM5M1pMWDQ1WkRzRkxuek5LOFkwSkY0RktCb1MxaWRxY21RVHVWS1dSMGNUU2tSVS1EUV9iOGV3OTJSRXhENVNJSmY2eFRURVV2eEpPbjhFZXF6cTdoaFJjV1g</guid></item><item><title>肯尼迪建议新父母“自己做疫苗研究” --《纽约时报》 | Kennedy Advises New Parents to ‘Do Your Own Research’ on Vaccines - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxOQ0RKSWJuM0lFMTk5V3FxaFRQbFdvMFBuNjc4R0dCQlZ2ZzVCU1F1dDJSZEpjcjRHREZlY3FPMzR5eWtlOHppcFRId21oNVdJbXRSYmswUFZMVG1IZVdNYW1KMm10ZDdmY2VfRXJCdFN6aHFoWXExMzJLMGZDekJTMlRiTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. advised parents of newborns to “do your own research” before vaccinating their infants during a televised interview in which he also suggested the measles shot was unsafe and repeatedly made false statements that cast doubt on the benefits of vaccination and the independence of the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Kennedy made the remarks to the talk show host Dr. Phil &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZofNzZ8UoPk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;in an interview&lt;/a&gt; that aired Monday on MeritTV to mark the 100th day of the Trump administration. He said, as he has in the past, that “if you want to avoid spreading measles, the best thing you can do is take that vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But Mr. Kennedy also made clear, as he has in the past, that he believes it is up to individuals to decide. In suggesting vaccines are unsafe, he contradicted decades of advice from public health experts, including leaders of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I would say that we live in a democracy, and part of the responsibility of being a parent is to do your own research,” the health secretary said, in response to a question from a woman in the audience who asked how he would advise a new parent about vaccine safety. “You research the baby stroller, you research the foods that they’re getting, and you need to research the medicines that they’re taking as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The phrase “I did my own research” became a cultural and political touchstone during the coronavirus pandemic, when proponents of vaccination, mostly on the political left, used it to denigrate those who had chosen not to get vaccinated. It became an internet meme and popped up on &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/353789732992" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;mock tombstones&lt;/a&gt; in Halloween-themed graveyards in liberal neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Kennedy’s comments came amid the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/health/measles-southwest-outbreak.html" title=""&gt;largest measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in about 25 years in the United States, which has included the deaths of two young children and an adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/diabetes/" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Diabetes&lt;/a&gt; deaths in the U.S. have fallen to some of the lowest rates in years, according to new preliminary figures published by the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention/" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, reversing a surge in mortality that was seen during the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/coronavirus/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 26.4 deaths per 100,000 people from diabetes, according to early death certificate &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/mortality-dashboard.htm#" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; for the third quarter of 2024 published this month by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Death rates from diabetes peaked in 2021, according to CDC &lt;a href="http://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D158/D434F595" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;figures&lt;/a&gt;, at 31.1 deaths per 100,000 people for that year. Diabetes was the eighth leading &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr73/nvsr73-08.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;cause of death&lt;/a&gt; in 2021. The CDC says the link between COVID-19 and diabetes may be to blame for that increase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Data show an increase in mortality rates for all people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and research shows that people with underlying conditions, including diabetes, are more likely to become very sick from COVID-19 and have a higher risk of hospitalization and death," Christopher Holliday, head of the CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation, told CBS News in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holliday added that research shows the pandemic may also have made it harder for Americans to properly manage the disease, ranging from interruptions to physical activity to disruptions to routine medical care diagnosing and treating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While diabetes-related death rates have decreased since 2021, they have not returned to pre-pandemic levels," Holliday said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 103,294 deaths from diabetes in 2021, up more than 17% from 87,647 deaths in 2019 before the pandemic. Provisional &lt;a href="http://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D176/D434F599" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; reported so far for 2024 have tallied 94,294 diabetes deaths last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes deaths had been largely falling in recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an increase in the prevalence of the disease. Those trends were before the introduction of new diabetes treatments like Ozempic and Mounjaro that have seen &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-declares-end-to-wegovy-and-ozempic-shortage/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;high demand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 1 in 10 adults had diagnosed diabetes &lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/NHISDataQueryTool/SHS_adult/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;in 2023&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK568010/#ch36.s7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;caution&lt;/a&gt; that analyzing long term trends in diabetes deaths is complex for a number of reasons, including changes in the definition of the disease over the past decades and variation in how death certificates record diabetes deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, not all death certificates record diabetes as the main "underlying cause of death" but instead as a contributing factor, which is counted separately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Diabetes is a more common contributing cause of death, not the primary underlying cause of death. Furthermore, most deaths among people with diabetes are cardiovascular and would be counted among the cardiovascular," &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1882/elizabeth-selvin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Elizabeth Selvin&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, said in an email to CBS News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selvin said it is up to doctors to choose whether to select diabetes or other underlying health conditions as the cause of a heart attack death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of this to say, trends in underlying causes of death will reflect awareness of diabetes and coding practices; It is hard to know what role these play in these data," Selvin said.&lt;/p&gt;

The compound was well tolerated, with only mild side effects, and benefits persisted for weeks after dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study was primarily designed to test safety, researchers observed meaningful and lasting improvements in multiple symptoms.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did participants tolerate the drug without serious side effects or worsening symptoms, which is what the pilot study was designed to test, they also experienced clinically significant improvements in mood, cognition, and motor function that lasted for weeks after the drug was out of their systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the first time a psychedelic has been tested on patients with any neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are still in very early stages of this work, but this first study went well beyond what we expected,” said the paper’s first author, Ellen Bradley, MD, assistant professor and associate director of UCSF’s Translational Psychedelic Research Program (TrPR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people don’t realize this, but mood symptoms in Parkinson’s are linked to a faster physical decline,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And they are actually a stronger predictor of patients’ quality of life with Parkinson’s than their motor symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the TrPR Program, within UCSF’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and the Department of Neurology, teamed up to lead this project, which was funded by an anonymous donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings appeared online earlier this month in &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Psilocybin’s lasting mood and motor effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by uncontrolled movements due to abnormal brain activity, affects about 1 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While medications like levodopa can relieve symptoms, there are no approved therapies to slow the progression or reverse the disease itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common early physical symptoms include tremors and foot dragging, but Bradley said anxiety and depression in patients with no history of psychiatric problems often precede the onset of motor symptoms by several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear why standard medications often don’t work well for these patients, but mood changes could be part of the neurodegenerative disease process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the safety of psilocybin for these patients, the researchers gave seven men and five women with mild to moderate Parkinson’s disease a 10 mg dose, followed two weeks later by a higher dose of 25 mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients completed psychotherapy sessions before and after the psilocybin — eight sessions in total — and were evaluated for changes in mood, cognition, and motor functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While nearly all participants experienced some adverse events while on the psilocybin, such as anxiety, nausea, and elevated blood pressure, these were not serious enough to require medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants had meaningful improvements in their mood, cognition, and motor symptoms at both their one-week and one-month follow-up appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team evaluated the participants’ mood again three months after their psilocybin sessions and found it was still significantly improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggested a variety of explanations for the improvements. The beneficial impact of psilocybin on the patients’ mood could have led to better cognitive and motor functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, people feel better, and that, in turn, helps them socialize and become more active – both key elements of Parkinson’s treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another theory is that psilocybin could provide relief from multiple symptoms of the disease by reducing inflammation and promoting neuroplasticity – the growth and reconnection of brain cells involved in mood, cognition, and movement regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An expansion into unchartered territory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this pilot study were promising enough that the researchers are conducting a larger randomized controlled trial at UCSF, enrolling a larger and more diverse group of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study incorporates noninvasive brain stimulation, neuroimaging and other tools to understand how psilocybin impacts inflammation and neuroplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will include a second site at Yale University, with the aim of enrolling 100 participants. This work will be funded by the same anonymous donor that paid for the safety pilot as well as by the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vast majority of brain diseases still lack interventions that change the course of illness,” said the study’s senior author, Joshua Woolley, MD, PhD, associate professor at UCSF and director of the TrPR Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can often treat the symptoms, but we don’t alter the trajectory or prevent decline. Now, that’s beginning to change. These results raise the exciting possibility that psilocybin may help the brain repair itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Additional co-authors include Kimberly Sakai, BA, Gisele Fernandes-Osterhold, MFT, Balázs Szigeti, PhD, Connie Ludwig, PhD, Jill L.

For instance, most adults who never received the HPV vaccine do not know they are eligible, so it’s critical to inform them of their options, said Verda Hicks, a gynecologic oncologist based in Kansas City, Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AQMITZYMF5CQBF3ALOJNMGETUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The vaccine offers protection against nine types of HPV, she said.

Also, prices can vary depending on where care is delivered and tests are performed. If you need a blood test, ask that your doctor send the requisition &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/routine-bloodwork-lab-work-tests-surprise-bill/" target="_blank"&gt;to a commercial, in-network lab&lt;/a&gt;.

A meta-analysis of 231 brain studies showed that chronic sleep disorders alter regions involved in emotions and memory, while short-term deprivation primarily affects attention and movement regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings could pave the way for more targeted therapies and preventive strategies for mental illnesses linked to poor sleep. Understanding these neural differences may also help develop treatments tailored to specific types of sleep disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different Brain Regions:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic sleep disorders affect the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, while short-term sleep loss impacts the thalamus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic sleep loss raises the risk of depression, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could inform targeted therapies and future transdiagnostic studies across multiple sleep disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Forschungszentrum Juelich&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About 20% to 35% of the population suffers from chronic sleep disorders—and up to half of all people in older age. Moreover, almost every teenager or adult has experienced short-term sleep deprivation at some point. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for not getting enough sleep, whether it be partying, a long day at work, caring for relatives, or simply whiling away time on smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109362"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain on a bed." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These regions are involved in processing emotions, memories, decisions, and sensations, for example. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent meta-study, Jülich researchers have now been able to show that the brain regions involved in the short-term and long-term conditions differ significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Poor sleep is one of the most important—but changeable—risk factors for mental illnesses in adolescents and older people,” says Jülich researcher and Privatdozent Dr. Masoud Tahmasian, who coordinated the study. In contrast, long-term pathological sleep disorders, such as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and short-term sleep deprivation, are located in different parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Lack of sleep has negative impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerion Reimann, one of the lead authors of the study, who wrote his master’s thesis on this topic at the Jülich Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-7), says, “The symptoms of sleep deprivation are similar during the day. Anyone who has ever slept poorly or not had enough sleep will know how you often feel a bit grumpy—or unable to perform tasks well due to your attention and reaction times being significantly impaired.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated instances of sleep deprivation can have much more serious consequences. Studies show that frequent sleep deprivation has an adverse effect on brain development, reduces the removal of harmful substances from the brain, decreases emotional stability, and causes a massive decline in working memory as well as a person’s performance at school or at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic sleep disorders and a continual lack of sleep are also risk factors for various mental illnesses,” says Reimann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Different brain structures detected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jülich researchers analyzed data from 231 brain studies. The studies examined and compared several groups—for example, patients suffering from chronic sleep disorders with healthy individuals, or healthy, well-rested test subjects with those suffering from sleep deprivation. The results show clear neural differences between the groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with chronic sleep disorders showed changes in a region of the brain known as the “anterior cingulate cortex,” as well as in the right amygdala and in the hippocampus, one of the brain’s central hubs. These regions are involved in processing emotions, memories, decisions, and sensations, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reimann explains, “These abnormalities reflect common symptoms that occur during the day with various sleep disorders, such as exhaustion, memory problems, mood swings, and even depression. Whether the changes in the brain are the cause or a consequence of chronic sleep disorders remains to be seen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, short-term sleep deprivation was associated with changes in the right thalamus, a brain region responsible for temperature regulation, movement, and the perception of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This corresponds with the symptoms of short-term sleep deprivation,” says Reimann. “You are less attentive, restricted in your actions, and often feel the cold more easily.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Important findings for future studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were thus able to show for the first time that there are no overlapping brain regions between the two groups,” says Reimann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is important for future studies. We can now focus on the precise structural and functional regions and networks that are representative of the respective sleep disorder,” he emphasizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individual sleep disorders have previously been considered separately from one another. Now we can also address questions about chronic sleep disorders in transdiagnostic studies—in other words, we can examine several findings at the same time,” adds Tahmasian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings might also pave the way for more targeted therapies and preventive measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many patients who suffer from insomnia—or chronic sleep disorders in general—also have an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders, as well as Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia,” explains Reimann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that we know which brain regions are involved, we can investigate in more detail the effects of non-pharmacological therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, in comparison to pharmacological treatments for various sleep disorders,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gerion Reimann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/portal/DE/Home/home_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Forschungszentrum Juelich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Gerion Reimann – Forschungszentrum Juelich&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.0488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Distinct Convergent Brain Alterations in Sleep Disorders and Sleep Deprivation&lt;/a&gt;” by Gerion Reimann et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Convergent Brain Alterations in Sleep Disorders and Sleep Deprivation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disorders have different etiologies yet share some nocturnal and daytime symptoms, suggesting common neurobiological substrates; healthy individuals undergoing experimental sleep deprivation also report analogous daytime symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, brain similarities and differences between long-term sleep disorders and short-term sleep deprivation are unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the shared and specific neural correlates across sleep disorders and sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Sources&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and BrainMap were searched up to January 2024 to identify relevant structural and functional neuroimaging articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Selection&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole-brain neuroimaging articles reporting voxel-based group differences between patients with different sleep disorders and healthy control participants or between total or partial sleep-deprived and well-rested individuals were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Extraction and Synthesis&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant coordinates of group comparisons, their contrast direction (eg, patients &amp;lt; controls), and imaging modality were extracted. For each article, 2 raters independently evaluated eligibility and extracted data. Subsequently, several meta-analyses were performed with the revised activation likelihood estimation algorithm using &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .05 cluster-level familywise error correction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transdiagnostic regional brain alterations were identified across sleep disorders and among articles reporting sleep deprivation. Their associated behavioral functions and task-based or task-free connectivity patterns were explored using 2 independent datasets (BrainMap and the enhanced Nathan Kline Institute–Rockland Sample).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 231 articles (140 unique experiments, 3380 unique participants) were retrieved. The analysis across sleep disorders (n = 95 experiments) identified the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (176 voxels, &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; score = 4.86), associated with reward, reasoning, and gustation, and the amygdala and hippocampus (130 voxels, &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; score = 4.00), associated with negative emotion processing, memory, and olfaction. Both clusters had positive functional connectivity with the default mode network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right thalamus (153 voxels, &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; score = 5.21) emerged as a consistent regional alteration following sleep deprivation (n = 45 experiments). This cluster was associated with thermoregulation, action, and pain perception and showed positive functional connectivity with subcortical and (pre)motor regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subanalyses regarding the direction of alterations demonstrated that the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex exhibited decreased activation, connectivity, and/or volume, while the amygdala and hippocampus cluster and the thalamus cluster demonstrated increased activation,connectivity, and/or volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distinct convergent brain abnormalities were observed between long-term sleep disorders (probably reflecting shared symptoms) and short-term sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 13:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE4wTS1zdHF3RUM5cHNFcWdwWjEyTV9od2o3eUJiSnZqS0E3dDF2MHdDSklPWnV2aEpSY3JGQWwxY1U1YjJMMGVSY0N4VjM3ZUhXVUZIR1Y3RVNNTldNM25ncDdCRTlwT2VkLXJrZUp3</guid></item><item><title>专家警告说，常见的卫生间错误可能会使您面临致命癌症的风险-每日邮报 | Common bathroom mistake that can put you at risk of deadly cancer, expert warns - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Storing sun cream in the bathroom could make it less effective at guarding against deadly cancer, a doctor has warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hot steam from showers and baths can cause the protective ingredients in the cream to break down, meaning the product can fail to prevent dangerous skin damage, according to specialist Dr &lt;span&gt;Ed Robinson. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It means millions who keep their SPF in bathroom cabinets could be at risk of deadly disease, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both warm temperatures and direct sunlight,' reduce the effectiveness of the sunscreen and leave your skin unprotected,' Dr Robinson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Using degraded SPF means you are not getting the full protection advertised on the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This increases your risk of sunburn, premature ageing, and, more seriously, skin &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-8d6b1120-25c3-11f0-82e1-a544321fbb00"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In some cases, broken-down ingredients can cause skin irritation or allergic reactions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, sun creams should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Millions have been storing their sunscreen all wrong, says aesthetics doctor Ed Robinson &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Robinson, who runs his own aesthetics practice in Cheshire, urged the public to check their bottles of sunscreen for signs that the active ingredients have degraded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes a change in texture—it could be runnier, lumpier or the formula may have separated. This means it is likely to apply unevenly, leading to 'patchy' protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A foul smell or darker, yellowish colour usually means your sunscreen isn’t as able to do its job as it should be, the expert said, adding to always check the expiration date too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He advised to keep the product away from car dashboards and glove boxes, windowsills and bags that are exposed to the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the summer months are approaching, slathering on the sunscreen is the best way to avoid skin damage. Experts recommend wearing at least SPF 30 on warm days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most well-known type of harmful sun rays are UVA and UBV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UVB rays hit the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) and cause the most sunburn, while UVA rays penetrate much deeper and contribute to ageing. Both are ultraviolet, and are known to cause skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A shocking 90 per cent of skin cancer cases in the UK are a direct result of too much exposure to the sun and sunbeds, according to Cancer Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have projected a record high of 20,800 cases last year and there has been a seven per cent rise in the deadly disease in UK adults aged 25-49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, those over the age of 80 have seen a rise of 57 per cent over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Exposure to the high humidity and temperature fluctuations can degrade its effectiveness by reducing its SPF protection. A survey found 58 per cent of people forget to protect ‘sun terraces’—areas including the nose, the shoulders and the soles of the feet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite increasing awareness of the disease, 45 per cent of people in the UK don’t wear SPF every day, according to an independent YouGov survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority of people miss out parts of their body when they apply sun cream, risking sunburn which can lead to skin cancer, studies show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2015 survey found 58 per cent of people forget to protect ‘sun terraces’—areas including the nose, the shoulders and the soles of the feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also commonly forget to protect the back of the neck, the ears, and the tops of their feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other most frequently missed body parts were the the top of their head, the middle of the back, the toes/feet and the eye lids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as the Skin Cancer Foundation warned that a history of five or more sunburns doubles your risk on the deadly skin cancer melanoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This assay is important for assigning patients to the correct clinical trials, but it will be even more important in the future as researchers develop targeted, precision treatments for PSP,” says Ivan Martinez-Valbuena, a scientific associate at the Rossy Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Centre at the UHN’s Krembil Brain Institute and U of T’s Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need diagnostic tools to be developed hand-in-hand with new treatments, so that as these treatments become available, we can identify the patients who would benefit most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In neurodegenerative diseases, misfolded proteins – often alpha synuclein or tau proteins – accumulate in brain and nervous system cells, eventually damaging the cells and causing neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While researchers have successfully detected these misfolded proteins in cerebrospinal fluid obtained through a lumbar puncture, the technique is not always accessible and some patients are unable to undergo the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, patients are typically diagnosed based on their symptoms and clinical presentation, so some patients may be misdiagnosed – particularly for rarer neurodegenerative diseases such as PSP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could also have a negative impact on research since patients with PSP may be misdiagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and be included in a trial that targets the wrong protein, influencing the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research that led to the PSP breakthrough has roots in an earlier study. In previous research, Martinez-Valbuena and his colleagues developed a test that could detect misfolded alpha synuclein protein in the skin in patients with Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have since validated that assay and hope it can be used in clinical trials, although the test is not yet available for clinical diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team wanted to extend that test for use in PSP. Using the same technology as the alpha synuclein assay, the team developed a test that could detect a sequence of misfolded tau specific to PSP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Following a meticulous and innovative strategy, Ivan reported for the first time in the literature that disease-associated tau protein can be detected in the skin in living patients with high accuracy,” says Gabor Kovacs, Martinez-Valbuena’s supervisor, a neuropathologist at UHN and a principal investigator at the Tanz Centre who is also a professor of laboratory medicine and pathobiology in U of T’s Temerty Faculty of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working collaboratively with colleagues in the Rossy PSP Centre, Martinez-Valbuena, Kovacs and a clinical team led by Anthony Lang – who is director of the Rossy Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Centre, the Lily Safra Chair in Movement Disorders at UHN and the Jack Clark Chair for Parkinson’s Disease Research at U of T’s Temerty Faculty of Medicine – were able to access patient samples and validate the new test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers examined skin biopsies of patients with PSP as well as people with multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration, Parkinson’s disease and healthy controls, they found misfolded tau in most patients with PSP, but much less frequently in other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the misfolded tau protein was not detected in patients with Parkinson’s disease or the healthy controls. Overall, the researchers found that the assay had 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am so delighted to see this exciting development of a new biomarker for this rare neurodegenerative disease, made possible by the close collaboration of world-leading scientists in Toronto,” says Graham Collingridge, senior investigator at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Sinai Health and director of the Tanz Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez-Valbuena says the test could be incorporated into a panel of blood- and skin-based tests, along with clinical information, to help clinicians make more precise diagnoses and recommend more appropriate clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It will be important to pair this skin-based assay together with a patient’s clinical symptoms, and this will give us a much better picture of the patient’s diagnosis,” says Martinez-Valbuena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we have precision treatments targeting these misfolded proteins, we will have a better idea of the treatment each patient should receive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now validating the assay in more patients through a clinical trial at five PSP centres in North America and Europe. The Toronto team will continue to study the assay to ensure it is practical and convenient for use outside of major research centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this PSP and neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/news/authors-reporters/eileen-hoftyzer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eileen Hoftyzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eileen Hoftyzer – University of Toronto&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2824066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Four-Repeat Tau Seeding in the Skin of Patients With Progressive Supranuclear Palsy&lt;/a&gt;” by Ivan Martinez-Valbuena et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four-Repeat Tau Seeding in the Skin of Patients With Progressive Supranuclear Palsy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of α-synuclein seeding amplification assays (SAA) has provided a new tool to support a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technology enables the detection of aggregated forms of α-synuclein (the neuropathologic hallmark of these diseases) in brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and in peripheral tissues, such as skin.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 12:59:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE9Fb3pJUUtUTUtRM2REa0QxWG9QTjZkVkt4QllHNDNJalJkeDRCOGxRbHVrYnV4dEFsVkZvalJ4NWkxYXp1UU5HMEVzbmVMVndGS25MT3p3U2xmcVhmMUJOdl8tMVZhUjRuT0E0</guid></item><item><title>肠道专家说，一个厕所习惯对您的健康特别不利- Surrey Live | Gut expert says one toilet habit is particularly bad for your health - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxNTzAtRTVRNDk3R2tmZDJZSW4xTDZEN1I4Wjk0R3BmeDd2MDFBSFgxTFhhSG9xUVNuTnFneUF3cFh1alJlVTMwRFFwOGEyXzEwX183OTBVd1hVRkRpc3o4c3B2MnI0MHl0WFFkX1FzUVNWOFVFTGpnWmNNZmpjQnNxRdIBhgFBVV95cUxNX1NmYTRZSGktbXVfWFNlbkZzT0FsNXE0ZlV1c19OV01HWkVtUl9fYjdFTExpNU1WS2dYbXBqYndrQVpnZUlpYXhndzJIdF9icXdnb0dsOWJzTFhOd3k4TTlwUlBqRVNtMXpNRG1qT0lmYV91ZGlIaGI3REtQbFpwODU5OXVfQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gut health nutritionist has explained how often you should be going to the toilet and says one habit is particularly bad for you. Nutritionist Adrienne Benjamin has explained the potential impact our bowel routines have on our health. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adrienne, nutritionist at &lt;a href="https://provenbiotics.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ProVenBiotics&lt;/a&gt;, said: “Whilst bowel habits vary widely and everybody has their own individual pattern, having a bowel movement at least once a day every day is considered the sign of a healthy digestive system and can help minimise digestive issues such as discomfort and bloating. Regular daily bowel movements help ensure that waste is efficiently eliminated from the body, helping to prevent the risk of constipation, flatulence, bloating and other IBS symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the natural urge to pass a bowel movement, 76% of Brits admit they have held their poo in at some point. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adrienne said: “Holding in a stool once every so often is unlikely to have an impact, but if you are regularly holding bowel movements in for a number of hours, this may have a detrimental effect on your digestive health. When you suppress the urge to go, it can lead to constipation and digestive discomfort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The longer the stool stays in the colon, the more water is reabsorbed, making it more uncomfortable and difficult to pass. Delaying bowel movements may also trigger or exacerbate IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) symptoms such as cramping, bloating and changes in bowel habits. It’s important to listen to your body’s signals and avoid delaying bowel movements whenever possible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adrienne added: "Particularly foul-smelling stools can be a sign of underlying digestive health issues, including IBS. While it's normal for stools to have an odour, an unusually strong or offensive smell and/or consistency can indicate malabsorption, where the body isn't properly digesting or absorbing nutrients from food.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This could be a result of IBS, which often causes an imbalance in the gut, leading to symptoms like bloating, diarrhoea, or constipation, all of which can contribute to more pungent stools. In some cases, foul-smelling stools can also be linked to bacterial overgrowth or food intolerances, both of which are common in individuals with digestive disorders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Poor digestive health can manifest in a variety of different ways, including bloating, irregular bowel movements, discomfort, and even fatigue and mental health issues. These issues are often linked to an imbalance in the gut microbiome, disrupting digestion and overall gut health. Probiotics, which are live beneficial bacteria, play a crucial role in supporting gut health by helping to restore this balance. By introducing more specific beneficial bacteria into the digestive system, probiotics can help to support microbiome balance, which in turn can help to support nutrient absorption, improve bowel regularity, and reduce symptoms like bloating and gas. Incorporating probiotics into your daily routine, or probiotic-rich foods like yogurt and kefir, can help support a healthy gut microbiome, promote digestion and help to improve overall digestive health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 11:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxNTzAtRTVRNDk3R2tmZDJZSW4xTDZEN1I4Wjk0R3BmeDd2MDFBSFgxTFhhSG9xUVNuTnFneUF3cFh1alJlVTMwRFFwOGEyXzEwX183OTBVd1hVRkRpc3o4c3B2MnI0MHl0WFFkX1FzUVNWOFVFTGpnWmNNZmpjQnNxRdIBhgFBVV95cUxNX1NmYTRZSGktbXVfWFNlbkZzT0FsNXE0ZlV1c19OV01HWkVtUl9fYjdFTExpNU1WS2dYbXBqYndrQVpnZUlpYXhndzJIdF9icXdnb0dsOWJzTFhOd3k4TTlwUlBqRVNtMXpNRG1qT0lmYV91ZGlIaGI3REtQbFpwODU5OXVfQQ</guid></item><item><title>您可以和孩子一起尝试这个快乐的7分钟锻炼-《华盛顿邮报》 | Try this joyful 7-minute workout you can do with kids - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNVVNDaXV2VXJBVHVlRXI5U0dDN01ZR0xMVlhkMmtjTjRqaEFzdzlKaUlIbV9YeEpoN1ZkM0FBUWZRTkd1a2hTdE5Ma1MwNkxmbU9MdS1SV0tzY2hrU0FjN2NqSW96MjlZYnlKRmtYM1ZHVnFSQzVkTWpsY1NGNGRaUTN6RC1Zb2thZnBrWFV3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story relative"&gt;&lt;p id="KCABHNW2KVBK7COBWCUYX5CEBI" data-contentid="KCABHNW2KVBK7COBWCUYX5CEBI" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;Here’s an easy way to add fun and fitness to your family life: Invite the kids to spend the next seven minutes with you, scurrying through an imaginary park, ducking branches, dodging lava and crawling like a bear, as part of the new, science-based 7-minute workout with kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5KS2U5IY55GEDHL3GHZQ4PRA4E" data-contentid="5KS2U5IY55GEDHL3GHZQ4PRA4E" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;This workout, developed by exercise physiologist Chris Jordan for The Washington Post, with input from his two children, is meant to help combat the growing inactivity of America’s youths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;recommends a minimum of 60 minutes a day of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/children.html?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; for young people who don’t have health or disability issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="PJLV PJLV-igWRsMW-css"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="A2S6SGD6IRFQLDLHFNPTUSZNAE" data-contentid="A2S6SGD6IRFQLDLHFNPTUSZNAE" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;But less than a third of children and teens meet that minimum amount, according to the Physical Activity Alliance, a group of academics and policymakers. In its 2024 &lt;a href="https://paamovewithus.org/us-report-card-on-physical-activity-for-children-and-youth/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Report Card on Physical Activity&lt;/a&gt;, the group gave American kids’ current activity levels a D-minus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV ad--enterprise"&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV PJLV-ikOErwM-css"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-lg mt-lg pt-md pb-md flex"&gt;&lt;div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"&gt;&lt;p class="dib flex divider gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="SNKBLPJPQBFHFMHMNFJXWNGEOE" data-contentid="SNKBLPJPQBFHFMHMNFJXWNGEOE" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;Many of their parents wouldn’t score much better. A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/11/5942?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; found that parents with young children, especially several young children, generally get less exercise than people without children. There are so many demands, so little time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="QH7LI6BRGRAQ3BHNKYHI3PXKVU" data-contentid="QH7LI6BRGRAQ3BHNKYHI3PXKVU" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;Which is where the 7-minute workout with kids comes in. Jordan designed it to improve both endurance and muscular strength for adults and children, he said, with exercises alternately focusing on the upper and lower body, as well as the core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div target="_blank" class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-hHnAni-type-inline wpds-c-PJLV-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-ciKXky wpds-c-ciKXky-hNRVRD-type-inline"&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-bmgAQv"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Save this story to do the workout again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ID3JHX25YRH7LMTNDIGPQ35UGU" data-contentid="ID3JHX25YRH7LMTNDIGPQ35UGU" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;But, above all, he means it to be a blast. “Any physical activity for kids should be fun,” he said — not a chore but a route to joy. So this 7-minute workout involves imagination, as well as exertion. Pretend you and your offspring are sprinting through a park or a lava field or schussing side by side down a snowy ski slope. Customize the workout to your interests and your child’s. Fitness will follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="GTHK2OOFMRHSZFHDXHJH2OA6X4" data-contentid="GTHK2OOFMRHSZFHDXHJH2OA6X4" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;There’s also no reason grandparents or neighbors can’t recruit their favorite children to do the workout with them. Everyone benefits. “In my experience,” Jordan said, “kids are more likely to engage in and enjoy physical activity if you do it with them,” and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="6PTCNK3ASZFBFFCGWAXVT4JFCM" data-contentid="6PTCNK3ASZFBFFCGWAXVT4JFCM" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;Like all of the 7-minute workout series — the&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-science-original/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;original&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-low-impact-exercises-modified/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;gentle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-advanced-level-up/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; versions — this routine involves 12 exercises, each done for 30 seconds with a brief break in between. Do it anywhere there’s enough uncluttered space for all of you. You don’t need equipment, and the exercises should be doable for most people of almost any age.

It doesn't engender a lot of trust.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sydney woman H.T. (who didn't want her full name published) was so concerned by the change she experienced that she, along with many others, reported her experience to the TGA's adverse events recording system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After initially having great success with Vyvanse, the 31-year-old found that shortly after filling a new script at the start of this year, she began experiencing worrying symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had an irregular heartbeat, and started to have random anxiety when it's something I've never suffered with before,' H.T. explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was picking my hair to the point I created bald patches, and I had insomnia so severe that if I couldn't sleep and it was 6am and I needed to be ready for the day, I'd just take my next Vyvanse dose and stay awake all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By the evening I still wasn't sleepy so I would take a sleeping aid. All this was documented with my psychiatrist as I was going through the experience.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being prescribed a number of other medications in order to mitigate the impact, including an antidepressant and sleeping pills, H.T. noticed the spelling error on her new packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I went home and compared the two and tried to find information online and there was nothing. That's when I made my first post on a small Facebook group on March 10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I asked if anyone had noticed the package change and the spelling errors and then a description of why I was concerned. The amount of comments that were extremely similar to mine confirmed that it wasn't just me, and that it wasn't a placebo effect from seeing the package change, because all my symptoms and concerns were documented with my psychiatrist prior to noticing the packaging change.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next day H.T. called the TGA and asked if they knew what was going on&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was starting to believe that maybe the new batch was counterfeit,' she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;H.T. says the TGA informed her they did not have to notify consumers of any packaging change, nor could they confirm if there had been one, though they did say they were investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daily Mail Australia has since to spoken to more than 10 women who claim to have experienced adverse effects from the new Vyvanse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A TGA spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia they were aware of a recent increase in reports relating to medicines used to treat ADHD following an uptick in social media commentary, and that an investigation into these concerns is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the spokesperson clarified that minor labelling errors have been identified and are in the process of being corrected. The TGA published information about a Product Alert for this issue on April 3, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Anyone can submit a report about any problems associated with a medicine (including labelling errors),' they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Information about how to do this is on our website. We also urge patients and families who are concerned about these issues to speak with their health professionals for advice.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Jane, the potential complications she is hearing about are part of a wider issue with ADHD medication in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ongoing shortages are impacting families across the country. Methylphenidate hydrochloride (sold as Concerta) is running low, with the TGA confirming limited supply of its 18mg, 27mg, 36mg and 54mg modified-release tablet products until the end of May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now we're in this very confusing space when it comes to how we can all live, work and stay alive, because it seems nearly every stimulant medication used to treat ADHD has either a major issue with it or it is unavailable,' Jane says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of particular concern, she adds, are the parents who have resorted to sourcing the medication without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You have a controlled substance that some mums are now "black-marketing" because they are desperate,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're in school holidays. We've got unmedicated children. We're unmedicated ourselves. We've already been through the long, big journey, and it feels like no one cares.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

One dose is 93% effective and two doses are 97% effective against measles, the CDC says. Most vaccinated adults don't need an additional dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;At current vaccination rates, the model predicts measles could once again become endemic -- constantly present -- in the U.S. with an estimated 851,300 cases over 25 years.

This is lower than the 93.1% seen the previous school year and the 95.2% seen in the 2019 to 2020 school year, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"That result -- that we're already at this tipping point for measles in the U.S. -- was a really striking finding that somewhat surprised us as well," Dr. Nathan Lo, study co-author and an infectious diseases physician at Stanford Medicine, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We continue to see measles outbreaks, but, by doing the study … you start to crystallize that result that even under the current levels of vaccine decline, there is a very feasible scenario where, over time, our country has measles return where it's a common household disease again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, who was not involved in the study, said the findings are a "well-thought-out worst-case scenario."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I'm not entirely sure that would actually happen because … the general level of vaccination remains pretty high, but there are pockets of unvaccinated children, and what you're seeing now is the fact that this virus has been reintroduced several times from other parts of the world," he told ABC News. "I think it's a bit of a worst-case scenario but, as a worst-case scenario, it's scary and, in that sense, reasonable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, the model estimated that just a 5% increase in vaccination would lead to only 5,800 cases over the same 25-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This is because when more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most are protected from measles through community immunity, also known as herd immunity, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"My hope is that this study can provide that data to parents to say, 'This is the benefit of continuing to vaccinate your child. This is the kind of alternate reality that we're preventing. And yes, the risks aren't here right now, but perhaps not too far off,'" Lo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Schaffner said there are pockets of the U.S. where MMR vaccination rates are 80% or less and vaccination rates would need to increase substantially in those areas to reduce the number of cases long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, "if we increase the level of vaccination by a small amount that would reduce the risk of other small outbreaks here and there," Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study also found that a 50% drop in vaccinations would lead to an estimated 51.2 million cases over 25 years, but Lo thinks that would only occur if there were a large-scale policy change by the Department of Health and Human Services or the CDC to reduce or remove the childhood vaccine recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As of Friday, the CDC has &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed nearly 900 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; in at least 29 states.

However, an outbreak lasting 12 months or more would threaten to end measles elimination status in the U.S. The Texas outbreak began in January of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;To drive vaccination rates up, Lo and Schaffner recommend that parents who haven't vaccinated their children yet speak to their pediatrician to address their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We have to provide recommendations and let people know the facts that these vaccines are very effective and that they are safe," Schaffner said.

                A survey of older Americans found that 79% would want to know if they were in the early stages of Alzheimer's, and 92% said that if diagnosed, they would probably or definitely want to take a drug that could slow down the disease's progression. The results may indicate a recent shift in openness toward Alzheimer's testing and treatment.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Older Americans want to know if they are in the early stages of Alzheimer's and would happily take a blood test to find out, according to a national survey.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The survey of 1,700 people 45 and older, part of a &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the Alzheimer's Association, found growing interest in testing, diagnosis, and treatment for the deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More than 7 million people in the United States are now living with Alzheimer's, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Among the survey's key findings:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– Nearly four in five respondents (79%) would want to know they had the disease before symptoms began to interfere with their daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;– 80% said they would ask a doctor to be tested, rather than waiting for a test to be offered.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;– 91% said they'd want a blood biomarker test, or some other simple test, if one were available. (Most respondents did not know that several blood tests already on the market can indicate the presence of amyloid plaques in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer's.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– 92% said that if diagnosed with Alzheimer's, they would probably or definitely want to take a drug that could slow down the disease's progression. (Two recently approved drugs, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/07/06/1186225580/alzheimers-drug-leqembi-gets-full-fda-approval-medicare-coverage-lecanemab"&gt;lecanemab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/10/g-s1-3818/fda-advisors-back-alzheimer-drug-donanemab-despite-risks"&gt;donanemab&lt;/a&gt;, can do this for people in the earliest stages.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– 58% said they would take an Alzheimer's drug even if it had a moderate or high risk of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– 83% said that, if diagnosed, they would be open to participating in a clinical trial of an experimental treatment to slow or cure the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– 81% expect that in the next decade, treatments will arrive that can halt the progression of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– 44% say they are worried that insurance will not cover treatment and care if a test indicates they have the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A shift in perspective &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The responses show that people are becoming less afraid and more proactive about an Alzheimer's diagnosis, says &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/press/spokespeople/elizabeth-edgerly" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Elizabeth Edgerly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist who directs community programs for the Alzheimer's Association.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In the past, Edgerly says her clients would often say, "Well gosh, I wouldn't want to know," or "Why would I want to know?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One reason for the change may be that it's now easier to find out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Just a few years ago, it took a PET scan or spinal tap to confirm the presence of sticky amyloid plaques in the brain, Edgerly says. Now, a simple blood test can often provide the answer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Another factor is the arrival of drug treatment for people in the early stages of Alzheimer's, Edgerly says. That gives people another reason to get a diagnosis while they are still capable of making their own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While symptoms are still mild, Edgerly says, "they can articulate what they'd like for their future, they can decide whether they want to try treatments."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The arrival of drug treatment has made people living with Alzheimer's more optimistic, says Dr. Nathaniel Chin, a geriatrician at the University of Wisconsin who was not involved in the survey.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Even if it doesn't stop the disease in its tracks, it tells people that we're making progress," he says. "They want to know if they potentially could have this therapy or maybe the next therapy or two therapies down the road."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The survey results reflect changes in the public's attitude toward Alzheimer's that Chin is seeing in his own practice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I don't think people are as fearful as they have been in the past," he says. "I think there's a desire to know what's happening to our bodies."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Patient-driven change&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many doctors, though, remain skeptical about the benefits of testing. Chin says that's in part because they see existing drugs as only marginally helpful.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Some patients are ahead of their doctors in this regard," he says. "They want this information and they are going to ask about it."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Chin offers blood tests to his own patients with cognitive problems. And he expects the tests to become increasingly common.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But that is likely to bring some new challenges, he says. For example, many health professionals are not trained to counsel people who have just learned they have Alzheimer's. And a positive test result in someone's medical record has the potential to jeopardize their job, or health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There are protections for people who learn their genetic information," he says, "but as of now there are not protections for people who are learning if you are cognitively unimpaired or cognitively healthy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now that more people are finding out, he says, it's up to groups including the Alzheimer's Association to push for those protections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A protein-rich breakfast keeps you full, energized and focused all morning long.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yet, many go-to breakfast foods are low in protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our Broccoli, White Bean &amp;amp; Cheese Quiche is packed with protein, fiber and more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Breakfast sets the tone for your day. But, when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, many breakfast foods like toast, oatmeal and pastries fall short. Prioritizing protein at breakfast can keep you energized and focused throughout the morning and feeling full and satisfied for hours. If you’re working out, it can also promote muscle recovery.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What makes protein so effective? For starters, it helps slow down the digestion of carbohydrates, which means more stable energy and fewer midmorning crashes that leave you reaching for another cup of coffee. Research suggests it may also help improve concentration during those first few hours of the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  And—if weight loss is a goal—a high-protein breakfast promotes satiety and may even increase your calorie burn.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With all of these perks, it makes sense to fill your plate with protein-rich foods first thing in the morning. As beneficial as protein is, it isn’t the only nutrient you should be turning to. “Most people tend to skip breakfast or just focus on one macronutrient,” says &lt;a href="http://www.carolinethomason.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Caroline Thomason, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, a Washington, D.C.-based registered dietitian and diabetes educator. “But the truth is the ideal breakfast should provide a balanced combination of protein, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats and fiber.” That’s where our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/broccoli-white-bean-cheese-quiche-8782525" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Broccoli, White Bean &amp;amp; Cheese Quiche&lt;/a&gt; comes in. This satisfying breakfast hits every mark for a high-protein meal to start your day off right. In addition to 21 grams of protein from eggs, white beans and cheese, it also has a winning combination of nutrients we look for in a high-protein breakfast. And it’s a cinch to prepare.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-we-love-this-high-protein-breakfast"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why We Love This High-Protein Breakfast  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Filled with Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber supports healthy blood sugar and cholesterol levels while also playing a key role in digestive health. However, “many Americans only consume about half their recommended daily fiber, making this breakfast an excellent way to start closing that gap,” says Thomason. This recipe’s white beans and broccoli team up to deliver 4 grams of fiber per serving, or 14% of the recommended 28-gram Daily Value for this underconsumed nutrient. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber-heavy beans in this recipe provide another advantage. Research has found that beans’ combination of fiber and plant chemicals called polyphenols promotes a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. This, in turn, helps your good gut bacteria produce health-promoting compounds called short-chain fatty acids that are linked to better immune health and less inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Perfect for Meal Prep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you barely have time to brew your coffee in the morning, you’ll appreciate how easy this breakfast is to prepare ahead of time. Prep it once over the weekend, and you’ll have a high-protein, nutrient-rich breakfast ready for the week, whether you enjoy it at home or bring a slice to work. Another plus: You can freeze this quiche for up to three months. So you’ll always have a quick and healthy morning meal on hand. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Starting your day with vegetables helps you reach the recommended 2 to 3 cups daily without feeling overwhelmed, cramming them in later,” says Thomason. If you’re among the 90% of Americans who don’t meet their daily veggie quota, this breakfast can be a big help.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While all vegetables offer impressive health benefits, cruciferous vegetables, like broccoli, are especially good for you as they’re associated with better heart health and reduced cancer risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recipe’s mix of eggs, broccoli, beans and dairy packs a powerful punch of vitamins and minerals, explains Thomason. Each serving provides nearly one-quarter of the DV for zinc and calcium, plus 17% of your daily iron and 12% of your day’s magnesium. These nutrients work hard to support a healthy immune system, energy production, bone health and more. Considering that many people, especially women, don’t get enough iron, calcium or magnesium through diet alone, that’s a big plus.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re vegetarian, gluten-free or following any eating plan that restricts certain food groups, hitting your nutrition goals can feel tricky. This recipe is meat-free, making it an ideal high-protein breakfast for anyone on a vegetarian diet that includes dairy and eggs. And if you’re gluten-free and find it difficult to get enough fiber, this quiche’s 4 grams of fiber can get your day off to a strong start.

&lt;p&gt;Well, certain types of important doctors that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinical trial confirmed the health benefits of eating walnuts in improving colonic health and for cancer prevention, a spokesperson for &lt;a href="https://medicine.uconn.edu/"&gt;UConn School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/ellagitannin"&gt;Ellagitannins&lt;/a&gt; in the walnut are importantly providing the anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties that we’re seeing in patients in our clinical trial research, particularly the gut’s conversion of ellagitannins to a potent anti-inflammatory agent, urolithin A,” said Daniel W. Rosenberg, who leads a multidisciplinary team of researchers at the UConn School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-iLgdKCFX" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_iLgdKCFX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put in everyday language, Rosenberg said, “There are many potential benefits one can get from eating walnuts, with so little downside risk, that just grabbing a handful every day is really something that you can easily do for your long-term health benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg has also researched the connection between walnut consumption and its anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UConn research team’s clinical trial findings show that high levels of urolithin A formation by the gut microbiome from walnut consumption has a positive impact on reducing inflammatory markers across blood, urine, and fecal samples, and may even positively affect the immune cells within colon polyps, according to UConn.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;For the clinical trial, patients between the ages of 40 to 65 years and at an elevated risk for colon cancer, were referred for the study from the &lt;a href="https://health.uconn.edu/gastroenterology/#:~:text=The%20Division%20of%20Gastroenterology%20and%20Hepatology%20is%20committed%20to%20current,%2C%20liver%2C%20pancreas%20and%20colon."&gt;Division of Gastroenterology at UConn Health&lt;/a&gt;, the University of Connecticut’s academic medical center, according to UConn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of 39 enrolled study participants were screened by the clinical research team at UConn John Dempsey Hospital and asked to complete an NIH Food Frequency Questionnaire for analysis by Ock Chun Ph.D., a nutritional epidemiologist in the &lt;a href="https://cahnr.uconn.edu/"&gt;College of Agriculture, Health and Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt; at UConn Storrs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients were asked to avoid all ellagitannin-containing foods and beverages for a week to set their urolithin levels at or close to zero before they began consuming ellagitannin-rich walnuts as part of their closely monitored diet, according to a statement from UConn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the three-week study, all participants received a high-definition colonoscopy done by Drs. John Birk and Haleh Vaziri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the key findings the researchers found that elevated &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609777/"&gt;urolithin A&lt;/a&gt; levels in the urine of patients correlated with the serum levels of peptide YY, a protein that has been associated with inhibition of colorectal cancer. Reduced levels of several inflammation markers present in the blood were also found, especially in obese patients that had the greatest capacity to form urolithins by their gut microbiome, according to a statement from UConn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg also used high-dimensional spatial imaging technology that allowed UConn researchers to develop a detailed view of cellular interactions present inside colon polyps that were removed during colonoscopy at the end of the walnut study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imaging technology revealed that patients with high levels of urolithin A formation following walnut consumption was associated with reduced levels of several important proteins that are often present in polyps, showing for the first time how walnut ingestion may enhance colon health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team also found that the protein vimentin, often associated with more advanced forms of colon cancer, was greatly reduced inside polyp tissues obtained from patients who had also formed the highest levels of urolithin A by their gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings build upon the earlier work of Dr. Masako Nakanishi, an assistant professor in the Rosenberg Lab, who showed in several earlier publications that walnuts had beneficial and anti-cancer effects in the colons of cancer-prone mice, key findings that prompted the current clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Urolithin A has a very positive influence on inflammation and maybe even cancer prevention,” Rosenberg said. “Our study proves that dietary supplementation with walnuts can boost the general population’s urolithin levels in those people with the right microbiome, while significantly reducing several inflammatory markers, especially in obese patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg said the study provides strong rationale for dietary inclusion of walnut ellagitannins for cancer prevention.&lt;br&gt;
The research was supported by awards from the American Institute for Cancer Research, the &lt;a href="https://walnuts.org/about-us/california-walnut-commission/"&gt;California Walnut Commission&lt;/a&gt;, and the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

High cholesterol has often been called a ‘silent killer’ because people often don’t realise they’ve got a problem until a serious health issue arises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apart from some rare symptoms the only way to detect it is a blood test - but it leads to the clogging of blood vessels and arteries leading to high blood pressure and increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new study by researchers in the Penn State Department of Nutritional Sciences published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916525000577" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; just revealed that eating 57 grams of pecans per day, which is about two medium handfuls, could help lower cholesterol. The randomised trial included 138 participants — who all had at least one risk factor for metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess abdominal fat, and abnormal cholesterol levels — and divided them into two groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One group was asked to eat 57 grams of raw, unsalted pecans each day in place of the snacks they usually consumed, while the control set continued eating its typical diet. After 12 weeks, researchers found that “Pecan intake improved total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides compared with the usual diet group.” This translated to a reduction in total cholesterol by 8.1 milligrams per deciliter, or 3.6%.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kristina Petersen, associate professor of nutritional sciences at Penn State and co-author of the study said: “Replacing typical snacks with pecans improved key risk factors for heart disease including blood cholesterol levels and diet quality,” said. “These results add to the large evidence-base supporting the cardiovascular benefits of nuts and add additional insights into how adults can incorporate nuts into their diet to improve the overall quality of their diet.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brett Victor, MD, a cardiologist at Cardiology Consultants of Philadelphia said: “The study found statistically significant improvements in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, but it’s difficult to know how much of this benefit was due to the pecans themselves as opposed to the reduction of other, likely less healthy, snacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I would interpret this trial as confirmation that replacing unhealthy snacks with a modest amount of healthy snacks, including nuts and pecans if you enjoy them, is one way to promote a heart-healthy diet.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What did the study find:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the study, pecan snackers experienced reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol and triglycerides compared to non-pecan snackers. LDL cholesterol can build up in arteries and increase the risk of stroke or heart attack. HDL — sometimes known as “good cholesterol” — carries cholesterol back to the liver for removal from the body. So, both lowering LDL and reducing the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL can reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease. Triglycerides are a necessary lipid for energy storage and metabolism, but high levels of triglycerides also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Participants may have helped by being healthier&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers said people should consider consuming more foods with polyphenols — like pecans, fruits, vegetables and whole grains — to support heart health and improve overall diet quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prof Peterson said: “The improved diet quality among pecan snackers — including a higher percentage of calories from polyunsaturated fats and increased fiber and polyphenols — likely also contributed to the observed cholesterol improvements, particularly the LDL-lowering effects.” The researchers said that replacing a person’s usual snacks with pecans each day could improve cholesterol levels and diet quality, especially if they are at risk of metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Pecan Nutrition&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pecans are rich in many vitamins and minerals important for healthy skin, eyes, teeth, bones, muscles, and nerves. Pecans are a good source of calcium, magnesium, and potassium, which help lower blood pressure. Vitamin A&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Folate&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Niacin&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Riboflavin&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Thiamine&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Vitamin B6&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Vitamin E&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Calcium&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Iron&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Magnesium&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Manganese&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Phosphorus&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Zinc&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 06:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQOFBuYTNtRXlUZ2hWcDNrV200bi1kYXJLbTU3OWNKMWJaY0hySmtoODFhQXBybm9UdE9hWVMyWHpVYndsTDZYSEw1SlpNTjZVdDJiVmNvYVktZW5xSHBvQzJZanFZN2h6LTdtZ21aZG1hX01jY0hmVm9GY2ppZU9tZDZ4a1dsZHQ1QjFV</guid></item><item><title>罗奇博士：连续两位医生转向礼宾诊所-底特律新闻 | Dr. Roach: Two doctors in a row switch to a concierge practice - The Detroit News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxPTzVzOV9UaFB2Z0JlNVU0eFRfS3pLLXR5dFdmSWtfX1dMVk9CU2xXQno5V0tYLVpRMU5IWmVzbktORDMwY1JGUDhVR29KXzl0Mm1SRm5Yb0c1TGZuajJsaG5QSWRqSEtjaXRpVy0yVEw3aE9qTjFEbHZHLUtZcm9TX0hGaDVkX19KVFRCWnFvckdoTVlnWkkwOVFzTnV2M1JFS3Y2NzZIUWV4ZFhCRE55Z2Y5OGV4eTRUeUs1SEpzNEpoNko1NVFLVzVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_by"&gt;Dr. Keith Roach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; Two years ago, my doctor (whose patient I had been for many years) decided to switch to a concierge practice. He charged $2,000 annually per patient. Neither my husband nor I chose to participate. We found a new doctor who we have been very happy with for the past two years. Now he has decided to go concierge as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He is charging $2,000 annually or offering patients who do not wish to participate in a concierge practice an opportunity to pay an "administrative" fee of $500 annually to continue as one of his patients. Both my husband and I have very good insurance that covers 100% of our medical costs, and I saw my doctor three times last year. I told him that paying an additional payment of over $150 per visit is ridiculous. So, once again, we are looking for another physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This appears to be occurring quite often in my area. My question to you is, do you think this is right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— P.E.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear P.E.:&lt;/strong&gt; In my opinion, concierge medicine can be done ethically, but I have real questions about the way your physician is moving to a concierge or "retainer" medicine practice. If a physician chooses to move to a concierge model, which by itself is not unethical, they ought to help their existing patients find care and aid with the transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I don't agree with the $500 "administrative fee" per year, which sounds like a charge solely to remain as his patient and get no additional service. I understand the benefits of a concierge practice to a physician, and for those who can afford it, there are advantages for the patient, too. But it is my personal opinion that we physicians have an obligation to provide care. I have known concierge physicians who volunteer at free clinics as a way of fulfilling their professional obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I first heard about a disease called "sweating sickness" while watching a television series. Do people still get sweating sickness under a different name?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— J.S.B.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear J.S.B.:&lt;/strong&gt; Sweating sickness was a disease that was found in England between 1485-1581 but wasn't seen again. The major symptoms were a rapid onset of a high fever with sweating, then death following in hours or days. The details of the described cases at the time have led medical historians to suspect that the disease was a very dangerous virus such as a hantavirus, which causes a hemorrhagic fever in Europe and Asia and a heart/lung syndrome in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hantaviruses normally exist in rodents but can occasionally cross over into humans. Less than 1,000 cases of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome have been reported in the United States as of 2021, but a prominent actor's wife recently died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Other authorities suspect that sweating sickness was caused by an enterovirus (a large family of viruses that is responsible for many diseases, including polio), which is the suspected cause in a condition called acute flaccid myelitis. But we can only guess at the cause of this mysterious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Highly virulent germs (those that kill their hosts) often die out quickly as they kill their hosts before many people get infected. However, some diseases become less virulent over time since the germs that don't kill people have more time to quickly spread to other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Syphilis, for example, was a rapidly fatal disease in Europe during the 16th century, but by the 18th century, it had become a much more indolent disease. (Though, of course, it's still dangerous and should be avoided.) The main barrier to syphilis treatment now is getting people diagnosed. &lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 03:33:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxPTzVzOV9UaFB2Z0JlNVU0eFRfS3pLLXR5dFdmSWtfX1dMVk9CU2xXQno5V0tYLVpRMU5IWmVzbktORDMwY1JGUDhVR29KXzl0Mm1SRm5Yb0c1TGZuajJsaG5QSWRqSEtjaXRpVy0yVEw3aE9qTjFEbHZHLUtZcm9TX0hGaDVkX19KVFRCWnFvckdoTVlnWkkwOVFzTnV2M1JFS3Y2NzZIUWV4ZFhCRE55Z2Y5OGV4eTRUeUs1SEpzNEpoNko1NVFLVzVn</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.告诉新父母“自己做疫苗研究” - HuffPost | RFK Jr. Tells New Parents To 'Do Your Own Research' On Vaccines - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxQazIyd2NYMkt5Y3p0M1M2QzFMTG1mbTNOT1ZPTExVeXNQbFd3SWlpWkJpYV9KUEY3UTVwcjNEOEFaa20zS1YxM2F1NlpPblBhd05RcVI3cWhQQlJWbzVBQkVkWWxVT2EzNEczZUpTenQzTXpkOXpiT0x4dnhFN294cFhPRFIxMzR6bW9ScWFncDZUV1dNQ29Pc1FB0gGfAUFVX3lxTFBoME5zMDVsRHo3R3JxMS1uVEhkMkViRXFBVTdLMXZOWWZFSnFrS0FISnlvdFF5VFFvT1ZOeHpHaDM1WjUtbUFkUms3bzE1YThfelpiT1AwUEdXQVk0VDg0NXR6WGFQNW1OVk5yTlBNWTRBWEV1OEhKQ0hETVZNR3RHTWNsR0VWWjdUTU93OG95SVpsbkpQXzZ5ek1XVWp1aw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite leading the government department tasked with advising Americans on their health and safety, Robert F.

&lt;p&gt;Experts say to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/11/lifestyle/heres-the-disgusting-reason-why-you-should-never-wear-new-clothes-without-washing-them/"&gt;wash newly bought clothes&lt;/a&gt; before wearing them — especially if they’re from a second-hand store. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this one poor soul learned this lesson the hard way. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Jam Press, a TikToker (&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@onenevertwoo_one" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;@‌onenevertwhoo_one&lt;/a&gt;) who preferred to only be referred to by his social media name, contracted a skin infection most likely due to his never-washed thrifted clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He explained in a now-viral video that he contracted molluscum contagiosum, a viral skin infection that consists of small, raised bumps on the skin. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite looking painful, apparently the condition is harmless and does not require treatment, according to NeedToKnow.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Although this skin disease is often spread through skin-to-skin or sexual contact, the TikToker blames his unwashed thrifted clothes for his welts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The content creator’s assumption might be accurate because, according to &lt;a href="https://www.human.cornell.edu/people/fhk2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frances Kozen, &lt;/a&gt;a Cornell University senior lecturer in fiber science and apparel design, garments often are treated with a fabric softener, a stain-resistant or water-repellent coating, or an anti-mildew agent that can cause irritation, redness or itching, she &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/wash-new-clothes-before-wearing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;told Self magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His vulnerable video received millions of views and thousands of comments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some empathised with him: “I hope you get well soon and are as healthy as before.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And others were confused about how he made this mistake. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Why don’t you wash your clothes first?” a commenter asked. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“New fear unlocked,” another person chimed in. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“More shocked because just found out someone bought clothes not washed,” someone else wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/population_and_sustainability/pdfs/Unravelling-Harms-of-Fast-Fashion-Full-Report-2023-02.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;They have things on them&lt;/a&gt; that you don’t want on your skin,” he said in the video. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that molluscum contagiosum is not the only skin condition someone can become infected with if they wear clothes straight from a store or online. People also put themselves at risk of contracting ringworm if they don’t listen to the experts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ringworm-body/symptoms-causes/syc-20353780" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, ringworm, which affects the outer layer of the skin, is itchy, scaly and contagious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[Ringworm] can spread through clothing, towels, and bedding that [has] not been disinfected after use by someone with [ringworm],” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ringworm/hcp/clinician-brief-resistant-infections/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;advised the Center for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; in a report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So if someone is trying on clothes at a store and has ringworm, and you buy those same clothes and don’t wash them first — you’re at risk of also getting the skin condition.&lt;/p&gt;

officials in Texas said the child had not had underlying health conditions and died of “what the child’s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;An unvaccinated child, aged six, also with no underlying conditions, died of measles in Texas in late February, Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers have warned that the country is at a tipping point for the return of endemic measles, a quarter-century after the disease was declared eradicated from the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The rate of rise in measles cases appears to be slowing down, but it is still concerning that we are seeing more cases adding to the count,” said Sapna Singh, chief medical officer at Texas Children’s Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;New Mexico’s health department reported 66 cases on Tuesday, the same as its last update. Most of the state’s cases are from Lea county, adjacent to Gaines county in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The ideal situation is to see a few weeks of no increase in the case count before we can have some optimism in the spread slowing down,” said Singh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;US pediatricians and infectious disease experts say the fight against rising measles cases nationwide is being hampered by a lack of forceful advocacy for vaccination from government health officials and statements on unproven treatments that are confusing parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Doctors assert that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection. Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. The disease has been considered eliminated from the US since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other states with active outbreaks – defined as three or more cases – include Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;With one-fifth of states seeing active measles outbreaks, the US is nearing 900 cases, according to figures posted Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC’s confirmed measles cases count is 884, triple the amount seen in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates – above 95% – diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their children from required shots. The US saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 00:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5BWU13ZUxRV0xBSjJxTE9CbEw3dHRKZjFvUzVjaGt4QXduWUZLOEhtLVNvOXRDODhoYTd0Z1Y0WlB1a3RTWjBlSk5zRWtMeUp6WmJna2VKcnBNdmFZeU1OVFhLZC0wTGFsa3RVV2NEX3R1dWN2bUE</guid></item><item><title>FDA负责人表示，他们正在考虑是否批准明年冬季接种COVID疫苗- CBS新闻 | FDA chief says they're looking at whether to approve COVID shots for next winter - CBS News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTFBQbERUSVRaQVZ3XzgzRWx0cHlIejBCLVB4UUtpWXJiejk3VXBRNVN4QlUwdzhKbldFY1p2Wl9KMjVqSUVVNE1ZbVg0V0lLeEIwQk1TaFFTYXNFRE02bFR5cEdWX0g0QzZnLUdCek5OOE9CTzY20gF6QVVfeXFMTTd0NUtoT3JOdm5fN09FUkZkaDBqRUpfUFNPTFdHUEpteC12TVhzVXYzZlZma0NuX1BUekpLRTlCdVNMdkJGMHJQVjNGbllfWVRxV3lmYmtiS0hHMlVWWmRzZEJ0b3VITnVjdjktWDBLUlhWWFYwb0I1a1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The head of the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/food-and-drug-administration/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; said Tuesday that the agency is now looking at whether it will still approve &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/coronavirus/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; vaccines for next winter, citing a lack of data on booster shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're taking a look. I can't comment on any particular application. As you know, we have a bunch of applications for those booster shots," &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-to-reverse-some-layoffs-food-drug-safety/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makary said many health care workers did not get the last round of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots, calling it "a bit of a public trust problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think there's a void of data. And I think rather than allow that void to be filled with opinions, I'd like to see some good data," Makary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His answer marks a change from during the Biden administration, when FDA officials backed plans to routinely update the COVID-19 vaccines each year.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the FDA issued guidance on what strain should be targeted by the shots for the following winter. Updates to Moderna and Pfizer's COVID shots for the new strain &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-fall-2024-fda/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;were approved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention/" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; is also now weighing whether to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendations-advisers/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;significantly narrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; its recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makary's remarks echo his justification for delaying Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, which was expected to get full approval on April 1. Novavax &lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/press-releases/Latest-update-on-U-S-FDA-BLA-for-Novavaxs-COVID-19-Vaccine-1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;said Monday&lt;/a&gt; that the FDA had asked the company to commit to another clinical trial of the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today, there is broad population immunity, and the big question is does it provide a benefit? Without a study on the new formulation and product, we can't give an honest evidence-based answer to that question," Makary told the &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/exclusive-in-conversation-with-fda" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt; "Inside Medicine" this week.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple companies are now also being asked "to do clinical studies, a basic clinical study, so we can educate the population and have information to work with," Makary told CBS News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's my general feeling, not with this particular product, which I can't discuss in depth, but with drugs in general, that we need to know if they work today in order to be able to recommend them," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also praised his special assistant, Dr. Tracy Beth Høeg, when asked what role she played in the agency's evaluation of Novavax's application. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dr. Høeg is an amazing M.D.-Ph.D. who has joined my staff as a special assistant to the commissioner. And she is involved in reviewing data sets at the agency. And I'm really excited to have her in the process," Makary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade industry publication The Pink Sheet &lt;a href="https://insights.citeline.com/pink-sheet/agency-leadership/us-fda/highly-problematic-acting-fda-commissioner-paused-planned-ok-of-novavax-shot-GUT6LR4X6ZALRMMZAEXYZHY36Y/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that Høeg had been asked to step in on Novavax's application. Høeg was also added to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunizations, in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/membership/index.html#accordion-panel-u8VYfF7hsP:~:text=Voting%20members-,Ex%20officio%20members,-Liaison%20representatives" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a slot&lt;/a&gt; previously filled by a career vaccines official from the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former FDA officials have criticized the agency's new political leadership for their intervention in vaccine approvals, a process which is usually entrusted to career scientific officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.biocentury.com/article/655761/safeguarding-sound-decision-making-at-fda" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; published this week, former officials Phil Krause and Luciana Borio called on the FDA to "stick to its normal processes."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Shifting standards and late-stage demands for new data — based on faulty scientific assumptions — erode trust, delay access to important tools, and discourage developers from advancing vaccine innovation," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, your body may not be able to fight off food poisoning. Every single person is completely different in a multitude of ways, including their immune system and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25201-gut-microbiome" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7868939" data-affiliate="true"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, the home of trillions of microorganisms that can influence your digestive system and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to food poisoning, it completely disrupts your gut microbiome, which is why you feel so sick. If you and your friend eat the same undercooked hamburger and you have an unhealthy microbiome while they have a healthier one, you may experience a bit of an upset stomach afterward.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A person with an inadequate microbiome will experience food poisoning more often,” Mazur said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you fuel your body with healthy foods, your microbiome will thrive. If you don’t, your gut microbiome may not be able to fight off bacteria from the undercooked or raw food that gave you food poisoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mazur said the characteristics of an inadequate microbiome are a lack of beneficial bacteria and microbial diversity, as well as high concentrations of pathogenic bacteria, which is a significant risk factor for frequent bouts of food poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted two other things that can affect whether someone gets sick or not: if they ate enough of the food to become infected, and what else they ate or drank that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you started the day drinking alcohol heavily, you’ve already damaged your healthy microbiome for the day, making you more susceptible on that specific day,” Mazur said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your diet plays a part in how healthy your gut microbiome is. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

At one point she even considered having her eye removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was only after Ellie was offered a "last resort" analysis called metagenomics, that she was diagnosed with a rare bacterial infection which was cured with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's been transformative," Ellie told the BBC. "I feel so fortunate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Professor Carlos Pavesio, consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, says Ellie's case is a "breakthrough in the diagnosis of infectious diseases". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There are many patients we treat with chronic infections for years, but despite multiple tests we cannot identify the bug responsible," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 2019, while still at medical school, Ellie began suffering from inflammation in her right eye. All tests for infection came back negative and it was assumed she had an autoimmune condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ellie was prescribed steroid eye drops and immunosuppressants, some of which needed to be given by intravenous infusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It was completely dominating my life," Ellie says. "I needed eye drops every single hour and it was difficult to balance that alongside starting work as a junior doctor.

"I needed eye drops every single hour and it was difficult to balance that alongside starting work as a junior doctor. My vision was really variable, and I would have some bad days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I was on so much medication and going to so many appointments, yet I didn't feel I was getting any better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The treatment and inflammation led to Ellie developing a cataract that had to be surgically removed, just after she graduated from medical school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ellie says she eventually reached "breaking point", and even began considering having her affected eye removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Whilst losing sight in one eye is terrifying," she says, "my biggest fear was that it might spread to my left eye."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Ellie Irwin A close-up of Ellie's right eye which shows a cataract - a cloudy light blue circle in the centre of the eye - which causes blurry vision" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Ellie Irwin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Ellie's eye developed a cataract that had to be removed&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was one of Ellie's doctors at Southmead Hospital in Bristol who suggested metagenomics - a last resort test not generally available to patients and only used where standard diagnostic tools have failed to identify or rule out infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Metagenomics technology uses cutting-edge genomic sequencing, which can identify all bacteria, fungi or parasites present in a sample by comparing them against a database of millions of pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A team at Moorfields Eye Hospital arranged for a sample of fluid to be taken from inside Ellie's eye and sent to the metagenomics labs at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) - the only lab in the UK officially recognised to carry out these diagnostic tests for patients, and one of only a few in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Currently, the standard method for detecting bacterial infections is by trying to grow a sample of it in a Petri dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For viruses, the most common diagnostic tool is a PCR test. These will be familiar to many from the pandemic, when millions sent off swabs in the post to confirm whether they had Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, Dr Julianne Brown, principal clinical scientist at the GOSH metagenomics service, says PCR has some drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The trouble with PCR is that you have to think of the viruses that might be causing an infection and do a separate test for each and every one," she says. "So if you've got an infection with something that's unexpected, rare or not previously known, you won't find it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Brown says metagenomics is "an enormous step up - it's a complete game-changer".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Ellie Irwin Ellie and friends swimming in the Amazon river, with their heads above the surface and the sun rising behind the trees in the background." class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Ellie Irwin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Doctors believe Ellie's eye condition was caused by an infection she caught while swimming in the Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In Ellie's case, metagenomics diagnosed a rare strain of the bacterial infection leptospirosis found in South America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is now presumed Ellie picked up the bug swimming in the Amazon river in 2018, while on a trip to Ecuador and Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ellie says it was an emotional moment when she was given the results of the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I broke down - I just had to cry.

To gather data on chimpanzees, which are some of our closest animal relatives, researchers observed five captive chimps at the Kumamoto Sanctuary of the Kyoto University Wildlife Research Center, which houses animals formerly used in pharmaceutical research.

The authors, a group of researchers at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, estimated that roughly 13 percent of cardiovascular deaths among 55- to 64-year-olds worldwide that year could be attributed to phthalates, which are used in food packaging, shampoo, toys and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Research on the effect of phthalates on cardiovascular disease is still emerging, but their link to metabolic risk factors like obesity suggest they could play a role in heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt; While experts agree that phthalates are harmful, they cautioned that the study relied on complex statistical modeling and a series of assumptions and estimates that make it difficult to determine how many deaths might be linked to the chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“This is an early step of trying to understand the magnitude of the problem,” said Dr. Mark Huffman, a cardiologist and a co-director of the global health center at WashU Medicine in St. Louis. But, he added, there’s a need for far more studies to understand the relationship between phthalates and heart health, and what other factors might come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="css-15h6bi9 e1gnsphs0" id="link-7101f615"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Phthalates are found in personal care products like shampoos and lotions, as well as in food containers and packaging. It’s possible to ingest them through food, absorb them through the skin from products containing them or breathe them in as dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The review of pooled data analyses of randomised controlled trial results published between 2012 and 2024 suggests that exercise can significantly reduce side-effects associated with treatment for cancer, such as heart and nerve damage and brain fog. Before this study, no such comprehensive evaluation had been published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exercise also seems to boost psychological wellbeing and overall quality of life, lending weight to its routine inclusion in treatment protocols for the disease, the study’s authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bjsports-2024-109392" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The findings of the review&lt;/a&gt;, led by Shengjing hospital of China Medical University, were published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. It included 485 associations from 80 articles, all evaluated as being of moderate to high quality. Types of exercise studied included aerobic and resistance exercise, high-intensity interval training, tai chi and yoga, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exercise significantly reduced various side-effects associated with cancer and its treatment compared with usual care or no exercise, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It lessened heart and peripheral nerve damage associated with chemotherapy, brain fog (cognitive impairment) and shortness of breath (dyspnoea).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It also changed body composition and key physiological indicators of health, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and C-reactive protein in people with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exercise also improved sleep quality, psychological wellbeing, the normal workings of the body and social interaction, while boosting overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There was evidence of high to moderate certainty that preoperative exercise reduced the risk of postoperative complications, pain, length of hospital stay, and risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In conclusion, this study reinforces the efficacy of incorporating exercise into cancer treatment protocols,” &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bjsports-2024-109392" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the researchers wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Moderate- to high-certainty evidence showed that exercise, compared with usual care or no exercise, significantly reduced cancer-related adverse events, improved body composition and biomarkers, enhanced sleep quality, psychological wellbeing, physical function, social interaction and overall QoL [quality of life].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Celene Doherty, a specialist cancer information nurse at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research UK, who was not involved with the study, said it provided further evidence that exercise could help reduce side effects from cancer treatment and improve long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“However, cancer patients go through a lot when they are diagnosed, and focusing on lifestyle changes like being more active might sound overwhelming,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s important to take things at your own pace and do activities that are right for you.” She said patients who would like advice or support on their situation should speak to their cancer team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxNYTQ1M1hPdjZlNWgtZVRkb2Z5VmJBNXAyWGxNbTdaUGJNV2JfU3ZIOWVLRW5GYXdpcEtaZWZMbFpvZDFNOUNobGhyanhwTzFhREtrWTFWTHRVM0RpS0JuS3VMOHZjUjVJcDdfX0JEUE9raVpLNGNqMjRZTXpNWVA3RTJ4b09aZjBFLWM1cWlxbVRpS3h5TUhoelFDODJ2T20yY3hLc0thRWNtSC1fQnpibF9QUXN1eTgyWFotRDBmdXRnaDYxZ081ZDhWS0dIUDg</guid></item><item><title>小RFK在访问德克萨斯州时表示，自闭症、糖尿病比麻疹更值得关注-德克萨斯论坛报 | In visit to Texas, RFK Jr. said autism, diabetes deserve more attention than measles - The Texas Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPVU8zcmZ4SVBaSVVMVXRPSnNqOVRkbl9hXzhpOE8tSHVWWnY2Z3dTRHRhQnU1UDNzdEZXdTBBVUJLOGY5eVViZXNDaWdVZXJVRzBiMHVXbzRNLUtrb3pZTEtPNVlvcjVLUHc2MzE1Vmp2Mm44VVpMMVFmckZfNHllV0VR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-story-body"&gt;

      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during a visit to Texas on Tuesday that measles deserves less attention than other chronic diseases, while downplaying the number of deaths that have occurred in the state’s historic outbreak of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;During a visit to Texas A&amp;amp;M University in College Station, Kennedy said that Europe’s measles deaths are higher than the U.S.’ “four deaths in 20 years,” two of whom were Texas children this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He also said more attention should be focused on chronic conditions like diabetes, as well as autism, which Kennedy has previously linked to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. The scientific community has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6768751/"&gt;widely debunked the theory&lt;/a&gt;, asserting the vaccine does not cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/time&gt;
    
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;

  &lt;/article&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Every child who gets measles gets a headline,” Kennedy said during the visit alongside Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. “When I was kid, there were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html#:~:text=Pre%2Dvaccine%20era&amp;amp;text=A%20vaccine%20became%20available%20in,States%20were%20infected%20each%20year"&gt;2 million measles cases&lt;/a&gt; a year and nobody wrote about them.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Over the last few months, Kennedy has been criticized for his response to the measles outbreak, which has been largely centered in Texas. He has questioned the role measles had in the deaths of three individuals confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control this year. He has praised private medical providers who have used alternative treatment methods on measles patients, to ease some symptoms including vitamin A and budesonide, an inhaled steroid typically used for asthma but does not “cure” measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Public health officials have repeatedly said that two doses of the MMR vaccine is the most effective way to prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He stressed on Tuesday that his agency has to take care of Texans who want to vaccinate, but also Texans who do not.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We have to talk to those people, too,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Kennedy stressed the federal support he’s sending to Texas, which has footed the bill so far to try to contain the outbreak through testing and vaccination. So far, the effort has cost the state more than $4.5 million since the first case was detected in late January, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We’re working very closely with the governor of Texas with the public health officials in Texas. We’ve provided them enormous support from the CDC, all the support that they’ve requested for vaccines and for alternative medicine,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He also struck an optimistic note about the state of Texas’ outbreak. He said measles cases are slowing as officials are doing well to manage the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While Tuesday’s state measles update shows the number of cases slowing in Gaines County, the heart of the outbreak, areas new to the outbreak, such as El Paso, are showing a faster rise in cases. On Tuesday, El Paso had 11 new cases, a 45% increase since Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas health officials were more cautious about whether this slowing of infections could be maintained. On Tuesday the number of measles cases in Texas had risen to 663 cases in 26 counties. Of those, 87 patients had been hospitalized and two school-aged children have died since the outbreak began in January.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;"It’s too soon to say. We can really only see trends looking backwards. We’d need to see a few weeks of decline to say that it was trending downward,” said Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services. “There was a lot of travel for the Easter holiday so we’re watching to see if there is an increase in cases over the next few weeks."&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Dr. Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Houston’s Baylor College of Medicine and vocal vaccine proponent, said work remains to contain the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The numbers are still going up,” Hotez said. “This is not a time to take your foot off the gas.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Rollins said she invited Kennedy to her alma mater to see Texas A&amp;amp;M’s research, as the two agencies work on the upcoming five-year Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The report, which both secretaries said would come out this summer, is expected to be a rejection of the latest 453-page advisory report, completed under the Biden Administration, that typically informs policies on healthy eating.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Traditionally, the dietary guidelines have been a political document,” Kennedy said. “Today, we’re changing that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;During the event, Rollins ticked off Americans’ poor health metrics, including how about&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult-obesity-facts/index.html"&gt; 100 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; are obese and the rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other diet-related diseases on the rise. She also announced a second round of funding for USDA’s &lt;a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/resources/programs/marketing-assistance-specialty-crops-masc"&gt;marketing assistance for specialty crops program&lt;/a&gt;. A total of $1.3 billion is being made available to farmers who grow specialty items including fruits, vegetables, vegetable seed, mushrooms, tree nuts, nursery crops, Christmas trees and culinary and medicinal herbs and spices.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Kennedy complimented A&amp;amp;M’s commitment to providing better nutrition to the American people, after making several tour stops on the campus including a sorghum greenhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“No longer will taxpayers pay for junk food and sugary drinks for our SNAP recipients. When we talk about chronic obesity and chronic disease, especially amongst our youth and our adolescents, it hits the hardest with those who are the most food challenged,” Rollins said.&lt;/p&gt;

It also activates receptors that cause the body to process drugs much more rapidly, possibly reducing the effectiveness of medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who sprinkle cinnamon on their oatmeal in the morning or into a festive beverage should be safe, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14197849/longevity-doctor-supplements-reverse-aging.html"&gt;people who take cinnamon supplements&lt;/a&gt;, which contain higher concentrations of the compound found in cinnamon bark, could be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Principal scientist Shabana Khan said: 'Overconsumption... could lead to a rapid clearance of the prescription medicine from the body, and that could result in making the medicine less effective.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cinnamon is already known to interact with at least 47 drugs, including blood thinners like aspirin and warfarin — where it raises the risk of bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now, scientists suggest the spice could affect a much wider array of drugs, although they said further tests were needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cinnamon has previously been associated with reducing inflammation and boosting heart health, but some cheaper varieties could interfere with life-saving medications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people in both the UK and US take cinnamon supplements, which are lauded for their alleged ability to reduce blood pressure and prevent blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The spice has also been revered by homeopathic enthusiasts for centuries because of its medicinal properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, Professor Khan warned, very few studies have been able to pinpoint the effects of cinnamon's primary component, cinnamaldehyde. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Understanding its bio-accessibility, metabolism and interaction with xenobiotic receptors was important to evaluate how excess intake of cinnamon would affect the prescription drugs if taken at the same time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists believe cinnamaldehyde - which is found in the oils of the dried plant - is responsible for much of the spice's health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cinnamon is also high in antioxidants, and has also been linked to reducing triglycerides, cholesterol, and blood sugar, according to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-proven-benefits-of-cinnamon#TOC_TITLE_HDR_5"&gt;studies &lt;/a&gt;reviewed by Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Longevity expert Dr Michael Aziz wrote in his book that cinnamon was one of the 'superstar' spices in his longevity routine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He believes it may reduce the risk of someone developing Alzheimer's disease - pointing to lab &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1043661817311659"&gt;studies &lt;/a&gt;showing cinnamon could prevent the formation of tau proteins, which form clumps in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is little evidence to support this claim, however, and scientists say more research is needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the spice's cinnamaldehyde that poses a risk to your daily medication regime as it can activate receptors in the body that break down certain drugs, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the team noted not all cinnamon is created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;People who take blood thinning medication should be caution when using cinnamon, experts advise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cinnamon oil — which typically is used in cooking and hygiene products — poses no risk, but cinnamon bark — which is usually found on spice shelves in grocery stores — does. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found cinnamon bark also contains high levels of coumarin, a blood thinner. This could cause problems for people who are already on blood thinning medications, known as anticoagulants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conversely, cinnamon oil - which is typically used for its antibacterial properties - poses almost no risk at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst more research needs to be done to fully understand the role that cinnamon plays in the body, Professor Kahn urged people who suffer from chronic diseases to proceed with caution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'People who suffer from chronic diseases – like hypertension, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, asthma, obesity, HIV, AIDS or depression – should be cautious when using cinnamon or any other supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our best advice is to talk to a health care provider before using any supplements along with the prescription medicine. By definition, supplements are not meant to treat, cure or mitigate any disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dober says these online influencers advocating a cortisol detox are “hijacking attention” using a medicalised name to give themselves an air of legitimacy that can translate to followers, engagement, money and customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It sounds like an easy fix to whatever issues might be happening in your life to target one particular chemical [but] the framing of this as a dangerous chemical is really problematic because it’s necessary,” Dober says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-cortisol-and-can-you-have-too-much-of-it" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What is cortisol and can you have too much of it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cortisol is the body’s main stress hormone, produced by the adrenal glands, and your body usually produces the right amount of cortisol to keep you healthy. Prof Creswell Eastman, an endocrinologist and clinical professor of medicine at the University of Sydney, says cortisol is an “essential hormone for life” which regulates blood pressure and the metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cortisol levels do increase with everyday stresses – and cause blood pressure, heart rate and blood sugar levels to rise with them – but that process is actually protective to help you solve problems and overcome that source of stress, Eastman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s our physiological response to the flight and fight mechanism, ensuring that we can survive some threat to our wellbeing. That’s why we make cortisol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If someone’s adrenal glands were to be taken out and they were no longer able to produce the cortisol hormone, when they were confronted with a stress they would not be able to respond to it, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The only people who have too much cortisol have the rare Cushing’s disease – when the body makes too much cortisol – or Cushing’s syndrome, which occurs when a person takes too many &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/the-role-of-cortisol-in-the-body#medicines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;medicines that are similar to cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, Eastman says. “There’s no way you can detox from that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s no such thing as detoxing from cortisol excess.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="isnt-stress-bad" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;Isn’t stress bad?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dober says “we need a healthy ‘Goldilocks’ amount of stress to thrive and grow and to learn. As humans, we don’t want to have no stress in our lives. It’s not realistic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Chronic stress, which lasts longer than three months, does &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/sep/01/the-chronic-stress-survival-guide-how-to-live-with-the-anxiety-and-grief-you-cant-escape" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;impact health, wellbeing and immune system&lt;/a&gt;, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Stress management should be part of people’s everyday self-care, but Dober says the focus on the cortisol levels themselves is unhelpful and there are no ways to quantify them for the average person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She warns some “cortisol detox” tips being given could be harmful, especially when it is assumed the tips will work for everyone. As just one example: cold plunges or cold water immersion therapy can be dangerous for those with pre-existing heart conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-experts-recommend-instead" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What do experts recommend instead?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Karena Burke, the head of the school of psychology at the University of Wollongong, says “just focusing on cortisol reduction can be problematic, and not having enough is just as problematic as having too much”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There are aspects of the ‘detox’ process that is really great advice, but honestly the focus people should have is on changes to their lifestyle overall and sustaining those changes over time,” Burke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It is possible to ‘feel better’ after two to three weeks on these sorts of programs, but that’s because they also focus on dietary changes, stress management techniques and factors like reducing alcohol, spending time outside in nature and on increasing social connection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If someone is feeling that they are constantly stressed, they can try techniques such as relaxation, deep breathing and journalling, or increasing their physical activity – walking outside or along the beach is just as good as going to the gym – and working on their sleep hygiene, Burke recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It is important to consult a doctor, counsellor, psychologist or another healthcare professional, especially if someone is feeling really stressed or if they are planning major lifestyle changes (including dietary changes). A professional can assist to monitor the impacts and adaptations taking place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Burke says: “We’ve all heard it before, but there are few (if any) quick fixes, and there needs to be an individualised approach taken – that may mean experimenting with different things to see what works best.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dober says if people have genuine concerns around their cortisol levels, they should see their GP or an endocrinologist, but if we are thinking about general life stress, “trying to learn how to best manage stress at different points of your life can be very, very helpful”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c92b9cce-2120-4a3c-9557-68025e8615b2" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutBlockElementV2" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="CalloutBlockComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"callout":{"description":"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;What health trend&amp;amp;nbsp;do you want examined?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","prompt":"Ask Antiviral","displayOnSensitive":true,"elementId":"c92b9cce-2120-4a3c-9557-68025e8615b2","title":"Share your experience","isNonCollapsible":false,"formFields":[{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_is_your_namepseudonym","id":"172730135","hideLabel":false,"label":"What is your name/pseudonym?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_news_story_or_health_information_being_shared_on_social_media_have_you_seen_that_youd_like_us_to_examine","id":"172730137","hideLabel":false,"label":"What news story or health information being shared on social media have you seen that you’d like us to examine","hidden":false,"type":"textarea","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"do_you_have_a_link_to_an_example_you_can_share","id":"173258657","hideLabel":false,"label":"Do you have a link to an example you can share?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldRadio","name":"can_we_publish_your_response","options":[{"label":"Yes, entirely","value":"Yes, entirely"},{"label":"Yes, but contact me first","value":"Yes, but contact me first"},{"label":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous","value":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous"},{"label":"No, this is information only","value":"No, this is information only"}],"id":"172730143","hideLabel":false,"label":"Can we publish your response?","hidden":false,"type":"radio","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"email_address","description":"Your contact details are helpful so we can contact you for more information.
