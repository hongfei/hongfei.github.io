			&lt;p&gt;In an unexpected twist in the fight against  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="169059" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, humble kitchen bacteria and a plant best known for sweetening tea could one day help in treating one of humanity's deadliest diseases, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/kitchen-bacteria-stevia-breakthrough-pancreatic-cancer-fighter-study-finds/"&gt;scientists in Japan&lt;/a&gt; has discovered that fermented stevia, a plant commonly used as a calorie-free sweetener, may hold intriguing &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/26/9/4186"&gt;anti-cancer properties&lt;/a&gt;. While these findings are early and need much more research, they hint at a potential future role for stevia in tackling pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00261-2/abstract"&gt;Pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; remains one of the most difficult cancers to treat. Symptoms typically appear only after the disease has spread, and conventional therapies like chemotherapy rarely result in a cure. The outlook is bleak: fewer than 10% of patients &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/pancreatic-cancer/pancreatic-cancer-prognosis"&gt;survive five years&lt;/a&gt; beyond diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-sweetener-could-damage-critical-brain-barrier-risking-stroke?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Common Sweetener Could Damage Critical Brain Barrier, Risking Stroke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This urgent need for more effective and less toxic treatments has driven researchers to explore plant-based compounds. Many chemotherapy drugs already used today &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5588531/"&gt;have botanical origins&lt;/a&gt; – including &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/progress/discovery/taxol"&gt;paclitaxel, derived from the bark of the Pacific yew tree&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.jic.ac.uk/blog/vinblastine-and-vincristine-life-saving-drugs-from-a-periwinkle/"&gt;vincristine, sourced from the Madagascar periwinkle&lt;/a&gt; – offering a proven pathway for discovering new cancer-fighting agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4890837/"&gt;Stevia&lt;/a&gt;, a leafy plant native to South America, is widely known for its natural sweetness. It's a familiar presence on supermarket shelves, but few think of it as a medicinal plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169062" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169062" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SteviaPlant.jpg" alt="Stevia Plant" class="wp-image-169062 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SteviaPlant.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SteviaPlant-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SteviaPlant-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169062" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Stevia appears to hold intriguing anti-cancer properties. (yul38885/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stevia leaves are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10420666/"&gt;rich in bioactive compounds&lt;/a&gt;, some of which have shown hints of anticancer and antioxidant activity &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8874712/"&gt;in previous research&lt;/a&gt;. The challenge has been harnessing this potential, as unfermented stevia extracts are only mildly effective in laboratory settings, often requiring high doses to affect cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's where fermentation comes in. Known for creating &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/fermented-foods-sustain-both-microbiomes-and-cultural-heritage-221564"&gt;yogurt, kimchi and sourdough&lt;/a&gt; bread, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5637/10/7/330"&gt;fermentation&lt;/a&gt; is more than a culinary technique. I's a form of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/gut-microbiome-meet-lactobacillus-brevis-a-fermentation-superstar-213323"&gt;microbial alchemy&lt;/a&gt; that can transform plant compounds into new, bioactive molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Hiroshima University asked a simple but innovative question: what if stevia was fermented with the right bacteria? They experimented with a strain called &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/26/9/4186"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus plantarum&lt;/em&gt; SN13T&lt;/a&gt;, a relative of a bacteria commonly found in fermented foods. Fermentation produced a compound called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12154053/"&gt;chlorogenic acid methyl ester (CAME)&lt;/a&gt;, which showed much stronger anti-cancer effects than raw stevia extract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lab tests, the fermented stevia extract caused pancreatic cancer cells to die in large numbers but left healthy kidney cells largely unharmed. Further analysis revealed that CAME was responsible for this effect. It worked by blocking cancer cells at a specific phase of their life cycle, preventing them from multiplying and by &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/apoptosis"&gt;triggering apoptosis&lt;/a&gt;, a natural process where cells self-destruct when damaged or no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAME seems to alter the genetic programming of cancer cells. It activates genes that promote cell death while simultaneously suppressing those that help cancer cells grow and survive. This double hit both slows cancer progression and encourages malignant cells to kill themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The power of fermentation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented stevia extract was also found to be a stronger antioxidant than its unfermented counterpart. &lt;a href="https://biosignaling.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12964-023-01398-5"&gt;Oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; – an imbalance of potentially harmful moelcules known as free radicals in the body — is linked to cancer and other diseases. By neutralizing these free radicals more effectively, the fermented extract may offer extra protection for healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time fermentation has been shown to unlock hidden benefits. Fermented &lt;a href="https://journal.waocp.org/article_24814_93ecca7dbb764adbffb869ef1b886d1c.pdf"&gt;soy and ginseng&lt;/a&gt; have been found to offer enhanced health properties compared to their raw forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the stevia findings stand out because of the compound's selectivity. Killing cancer cells while sparing healthy ones is &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bug-drugs-bacteria-based-cancer-therapies-are-finally-overcoming-barriers-251278"&gt;the holy grail&lt;/a&gt; for cancer researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that these results come from lab-grown cells, not from animal or human studies. Many substances that look promising in petri dishes fail in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="169059" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; due to the complexity of the human body. Still, the discovery is exciting and warrants further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research highlights the potential of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-eating-yoghurt-regularly-could-lower-your-risk-of-bowel-cancer-251942"&gt;everyday foods&lt;/a&gt; and their natural microbes as untapped sources of new medicines. It also reflects growing interest in "&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-022-00974-4"&gt;microbial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4293675/"&gt;biotransformation&lt;/a&gt;" – using beneficial bacteria to create powerful compounds from plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of stevia, a simple quest for a natural sweetener has evolved into something potentially far more profound: a stepping stone toward a cancer therapy that's natural, targeted and cost-effective.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261599/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Intriguingly, the drugs seemed to have reduced their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mysterious-link-between-alzheimers-and-cancer-may-finally-be-explained?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Mysterious Link Between Alzheimer's And Cancer May Finally Be Explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alzheimer's disease comes with complex changes to the brain, which has made it tough to study and treat, but our computational tools opened up the possibility of tackling the complexity directly," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/07/430386/do-these-two-cancer-drugs-have-what-it-takes-beat-alzheimers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; computational biologist Marina Sirota, from UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're excited that our computational approach led us to a potential combination therapy for Alzheimer's based on existing FDA-approved medications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169045" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169045" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.31.54%E2%80%AFpm-642x494.png" alt="Certain Cancer Drugs May Reverse Brain Changes That Occur During Alzheimer's" class="wp-image-169045 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.31.54 pm-642x494.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.31.54 pm-539x415.png 539w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.31.54 pm-768x591.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.31.54 pm-600x462.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.31.54 pm.png 869w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169045" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The application of letrozole and irinotecan reduced the level of tau proteins (light green) in mouse brains. (Li et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having picked out letrozole and irinotecan as the best candidates, the researchers tested them in mouse models of Alzheimer's. When used in tandem, the drugs were shown to reverse some of the brain changes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-disease-harms-the-brain-in-2-distinct-phases-study-reveals"&gt;brought on by the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harmful clumps of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein"&gt;tau protein&lt;/a&gt; that build up in brains affected by Alzheimer's were reduced significantly, and the mice showed improvements in learning and memory tasks – two brain capabilities often impaired by Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining the two drugs together, the researchers were able to target different types of brain cells affected by the disease. Letorozole seemed to counter Alzheimer's in neurons, while irinotecan worked in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glia"&gt;glia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alzheimer's is likely the result of numerous alterations in many genes and proteins that, together, disrupt brain health," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/07/430386/do-these-two-cancer-drugs-have-what-it-takes-beat-alzheimers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Yadong Huang, from UCSF and Gladstone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This makes it very challenging for drug development – which traditionally produces one drug for a single gene or protein that drives disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a promising start, but there's more work to be done: obviously the drugs have only been directly tested in mice so far, and these medications also come with &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/letrozole/side-effects-of-letrozole/"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; attached. They need to be reconsidered if the drugs are going to be repurposed for a different disease than what they were originally approved for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the next steps should be clinical trials for people with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-a-critical-thing-we-can-all-do-to-hold-alzheimers-symptoms-at-bay"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. According to the researchers, this approach could lead to more personalized and effective treatments, based on how gene expression has been altered in each case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's estimated that &lt;a href="https://www.alzint.org/about/dementia-facts-figures/dementia-statistics/"&gt;more than 55 million people&lt;/a&gt; have Alzheimer's today, and as the world's population ages, that's expected to more than double in the next 25 years. Finding ways to prevent the disease and even reverse symptoms would have a huge impact on global health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If completely independent data sources, such as single-cell expression data and clinical records, guide us to the same pathways and the same drugs, and then resolve Alzheimer's in a genetic model, then maybe we're on to something," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/07/430386/do-these-two-cancer-drugs-have-what-it-takes-beat-alzheimers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sirota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're hopeful this can be swiftly translated into a real solution for millions of patients with Alzheimer's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.035"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The report, which was produced by researchers at the Medical Research Council’s epidemiology unit at the University of Cambridge involved a systematic review of 51 studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It drew on data from more than 29 million participants who had been exposed to air pollutants for at least a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although air pollution has already been identified as a risk factor for dementia, the research, which is the most comprehensive study of its kind to date, found there to be a positive and statistically-significant association between three types of air pollutant and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The pollutants were: PM2.5, which comes from vehicle emissions, power plants and woodburning stoves and fireplaces; nitrogen dioxide, which arises from the burning of fossil fuels; and soot, which comes from sources such as vehicle exhaust emissions and burning wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When inhaled, these pollutants can penetrate deep into the lungs and are associated with various respiratory diseases and an increased risk of certain heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More specifically, the study found that for every 10 micrograms per cubic metre of PM2.5, an individual’s relative risk of dementia would increase by 17%. Using equivalent figures for soot, the risk rose by 13%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Soot and PM2.5 levels approached or exceeded these levels in 2023 at roadside locations in central London, Birmingham and Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f029109e-a956-4175-b95f-271ccd119cd7" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":9,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"UK air pollution falling but danger levels still breached too often, say scientists","elementId":"f029109e-a956-4175-b95f-271ccd119cd7","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/15/uk-air-pollution-falling-but-danger-levels-still-breached-too-often-say-scientists"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease and in the UK about 982,000 people have the illness. Symptoms include memory loss, difficulty concentrating and mood changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Haneen Khreis, the senior author of the study, said it provided “further evidence to support the observation that long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution is a risk factor for the onset of dementia in previously healthy adults”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She added: “Tackling air pollution can deliver long-term health, social, climate and economic benefits. It can reduce the immense burden on patients, families, and caregivers, while easing pressure on overstretched healthcare systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Air pollution may cause dementia through causing inflammation in the brain and oxidative stress, which is a chemical process within the body that can cause damage to cells, proteins and DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers acknowledged that the report was limited because the majority of studies analysed included participants who were white and living in high income countries. They said future studies on air pollution should include more participants from marginalised backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Isolde Radford, senior policy manager at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “This rigorous review adds to mounting evidence that exposure to air pollution – from traffic fumes to wood burners – increases the risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Air pollution is one of the major modifiable risk factors for dementia – but it’s not something individuals can solve alone. That’s where government leadership is vital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“While the 10-year health plan acknowledges the health harms of air pollution, far more needs to be done to tackle this invisible threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Alzheimer’s Research UK is calling for a bold, cross-government approach to health prevention – one that brings together departments beyond health, including Defra, to take coordinated action on the drivers of dementia risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The report was published in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(25)00118-4/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Lancet Planetary Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPTF9ZX1czMjlyRG12WTc4MTd4SnVEc1hyQU9FMm9WLW0zUkRKRzFYQjQwWHNzX2x3LURfeDJhZ2tJOWdTVm9aVmxKVFN2akFRYWJSdVhkY3BDOHBidVhnQy1udloxRzktV2ZoTzA1dDBZcVhyclZ4TFJ6Tm5zQlNHVjFQYXdfQ0VWYkMwMFE3VHFmRGZxZVN6VV91TFdWcHZyUUlibWtTZHFmOTJvbFJhNS1TeTY</guid></item><item><title>在商店购买无麸质食品的威尔士借记卡- BBC | Wales debit card to pay for gluten free food in shops - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1iN2lvRWFjMG1Eb184MS1NLTM2ZkY1c3pndF96X29KMjZGZ0RwN051MV9UZmE3VnFJZ0djYkNhenZqYlM2SUN0bmVwTkZNeXRmMmQ2RGtnX2xVZ9IBX0FVX3lxTFBRTVJacVp3S1lXeGQyZlNRYTFDeFNJUG02T3FOUzdmSDFtRE5SSHZYbUFqNHI2QWlTOTNwOXJ0b05vTF94UFNuQ3RMV0dwRi1nV1l2R0lfbkwzX2w1eUVz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Cash cards to pay for gluten-free food in UK first&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Lola Mayor &amp;amp; Jordan Davies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC Wales News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2093/live/cb45aa40-67b4-11f0-b8da-2f6ba2aeaac8.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2093/live/cb45aa40-67b4-11f0-b8da-2f6ba2aeaac8.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2093/live/cb45aa40-67b4-11f0-b8da-2f6ba2aeaac8.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2093/live/cb45aa40-67b4-11f0-b8da-2f6ba2aeaac8.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2093/live/cb45aa40-67b4-11f0-b8da-2f6ba2aeaac8.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2093/live/cb45aa40-67b4-11f0-b8da-2f6ba2aeaac8.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2093/live/cb45aa40-67b4-11f0-b8da-2f6ba2aeaac8.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2093/live/cb45aa40-67b4-11f0-b8da-2f6ba2aeaac8.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Cherylee Barker smiles at the camera.

&lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. (WCBD) — A Columbia family is mourning the loss of their young son, who died after &lt;a href="https://www.counton2.com/news/south-carolina-news/case-of-brain-eating-amoeba-reported-in-south-carolina-officials-confirm/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.counton2.com/news/south-carolina-news/case-of-brain-eating-amoeba-reported-in-south-carolina-officials-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;contracting a rare brain-eating amoeba&lt;/a&gt; from swimming in a popular lake. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jaysen Carr, a 12-year-old student at Hand Middle School, died on July 18 after developing an infection associated with Naegleria fowleri in Lake Murray, according to a statement released by the family’s attorney. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Jaysen’s family is grieving this unthinkable loss, but they are also grateful at the outpouring of love and support they have received from the community,” attorney Tyler Bailey of the Bailey Law Firm wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="tsoswq6k" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The firm said it was hired by the Carr family to conduct an independent investigation into their son’s death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="tsoswq6k" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“The family has many questions about how and why Jaysen died and wants to do everything in their power to ensure this doesn’t happen to another family,” the statement continued. “Jaysen’s family would like to thank the doctors and nurses at Prisma Health Children’s Hospital-Midlands for their dedicated care and compassion for him and their entire family. We ask for privacy at this time as the family prepares to lay their son to rest.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina Department of Public Health (DPH) stated it became aware of a case of Naegleria fowleri in early July, the first in the state since 2016. Cases are not required to be reported to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Naegleria fowleri is a microscopic organism that occurs naturally in soil and warm freshwater sources, including lakes, rivers, ponds, and hot springs, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC). In rare cases, it can be found in poorly maintained swimming pools, splash pads, and tap water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is most often contracted when water containing the amoeba enters through a person’s nose while swimming. The amoeba can infect the brain and destroy brain tissue, causing an infection known as primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infections have also occurred in a few instances when people used tap water to rinse their sinuses or cleanse their nasal passages, as was the case with a &lt;a href="https://www.counton2.com/news/national-news/woman-dies-from-brain-eating-amoeba-after-using-tap-water-to-clear-sinuses-cdc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Texas woman who died&lt;/a&gt; earlier this summer&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The infection cannot, however, be contracted by swallowing water containing the amoeba or be spread to others, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Though PAM is rare — typically affecting fewer than 10 people a year in the U.S. — it is almost always fatal, experts say. The CDC reported that of the 167 reported cases between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms of the infection typically appear about five days after exposure, but can occur anywhere between one and 12 days after, according to the CDC. They include headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the infection progresses, health experts say symptoms including stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention, loss of balance, and hallucinations can happen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;South Carolina officials said there is no greater risk to the public, and the chances of contracting the infection remain low. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;People can further reduce their risk of infection by limiting the amount of water that forcefully enters their nose by holding it or wearing a nose clip when jumping or diving in fresh water. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOCK HAVEN, Pa. — June 23rd is a day that Kelly Brown will never forget. It's when her daughter, Brittany, noticed it was becoming harder for her mother to do simple tasks around her Allison Township home. That's when Brittany decided to take her mother to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They did all of the testing that we were asking for, but nobody thought of ticks, and it's not something that they do as a standard," said Kelly Brown, Allison Township. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown says she was sent home and followed up with her primary care doctor after she got her results back, noticing she was slowly losing blood. A week later, brown started feeling worse and went back to the ER, but was sent home a second time. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later, brown's daughter took her to Geisinger near Danville and spoke with the Hematology Department. The next day, doctors diagnosed her with babesiosis, a parasite found in ticks that finds a home in red blood cells. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The red blood cells, or of course those cells which carry oxygen around in your body, and over time, if the infection is severe enough, then that can result in what we call anemia, where your blood counts get too low," said Doctor Stanley Martin, Geisinger Director of Infectious Diseases. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babesiosis comes from a tick bite when they're in the nymph stage.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They started treating me with antibiotics, and then also because it was a parasitic issue, they started treating me with basically malaria medication," said Brown. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown remained hospitalized for a few days and needed a blood transfusion after her hemoglobin level dropped. After the transfusion, she says the medications started to kick in, and late last week, she was finally able to go home. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown says she's unsure where she got the tick bite since she's not an outdoorsy person. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stanley Martin, the Director of Infectious Diseases at Geisinger, says there are ways to protect yourself against ticks, such as using repellent, wearing long sleeves or pants, and checking yourself for ticks when you get inside, "If you're really concerned, take off your clothes, wash them right then and there to help get rid of any ticks or even take a shower yourself to make sure that you're removing any that might be attached."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown tells Newswatch 16 she's not only thankful for the doctors and nurses at Geisinger but also for those who donate blood, "They helped me, they probably saved my life, actually, and I don't know how many people donate blood, but it's really, really important."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

But it’s essential in your diet, and it keeps your body running smoothly. &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a41431425/zinc-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Zinc;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Zinc&lt;/a&gt; boosts your immune system, helps wounds heal, and supports healthy development during pregnancy and childhood, per &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the National Institutes of Health (NIH);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/a&gt;. And not getting enough of it can disrupt everything from your skin to your vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While zinc deficiency is pretty rare in the U.S., some groups are at higher risk than others, per the NIH. People with eating disorders, substance use disorders, and gastrointestinal conditions are most at risk for true zinc deficiency, explains &lt;a href="https://www.vitalrd.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Crandall, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jessica Crandall, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Vital RD. Vegetarians and vegans are also at higher risk, because many &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g39502942/foods-with-zinc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:zinc-rich;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;zinc-rich&lt;/a&gt; foods are animal-based, per the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerned you’re not getting enough of the nutrient? Here are eight telltale signs of zinc deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Slow-healing wounds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zinc deficiency symptoms can range a lot, depending on your age. But one of the most common symptoms—especially in older adults—is slow-healing wounds, per the NIH. Zinc plays a key role in your immune system, helping your body &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a63025471/does-zinc-help-colds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fight off infections;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fight off infections&lt;/a&gt; and heal injuries. So if you notice that cuts and scrapes are taking longer to close up, low zinc may be the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;PhotoAlto/Odilon Dimier - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hair loss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your hair starts thinning or falling out, low zinc may be to blame. Zinc deficiency can result in &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/beauty/hair/a45919873/how-much-hair-loss-is-normal/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hair loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hair loss&lt;/a&gt;, especially in older children, per &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-Consumer/#h1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the NIH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the NIH&lt;/a&gt;. And low zinc levels have also been linked to several hair loss conditions, including alopecia areata (an autoimmune condition), telogen effluvium (stress-induced temporary hair loss), and male pattern baldness, per a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5315033/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2017 review;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2017 review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;FG Trade - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Acne&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acne may not be a common zinc deficiency symptom, but it can be a sign you need more of the nutrient. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32860489/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2020 review;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2020 review&lt;/a&gt; found that people with acne tend to have lower zinc levels than people without it. Researchers also found that zinc can help quell your breakouts, leaving you with fewer zits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;d3sign - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Chronic disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zinc deficiency has been linked to several other health conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a22801286/pneumonia-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pneumonia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, per the NIH. Since zinc supports your immune system, being low on it can make you more susceptible to illness. Zinc deficiency can also make it harder for your body to fight inflammation and cell damage from free radicals—both of which have been tied to chronic disease, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X23001529" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ananda Prasad, M.D., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ananda Prasad, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, doctor and zinc deficiency specialist, previously told Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;svetikd - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vision loss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your eyes, especially your retinas, contain a lot of zinc. But as you get older, those zinc levels start to decline—and as they do, you may develop age-related macular degeneration, per a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31148351" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2019 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; and the NIH. The good news? Research suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a46446375/best-time-to-take-zinc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:zinc supplementation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;zinc supplementation&lt;/a&gt; can help you stave off vision loss. Just be sure to talk to your doctor. (Getting too much zinc has downsides too!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;PixelsEffect - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Loss of taste&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If food doesn’t taste quite the same as it used to, you may be running low on zinc. The nutrient is involved in some of your most basic senses, per the NIH. And not getting enough can impact your ability to smell and taste things—sometimes causing you to lose taste or smell altogether, per a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29260510/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2017 review;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2017 review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Daniel de la Hoz - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trouble hearing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running low on zinc can mess with your hearing in a couple different ways. Studies suggest that zinc deficiency may cause &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X23014900" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hearing loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hearing loss&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019607091400283X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tinnitus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;—a persistent ringing or buzzing sound in your ear. What’s more? The lower your zinc levels, the louder and more severe that buzzing sound is likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Johner Images - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stunted growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major sign of zinc deficiency—especially among infants, children, and adolescents—is stunted growth, per the NIH. Zinc is essential for healthy growth because of its influence on cell development, Dr. Prasad previously explained. A lack of it can slow down growth and development. And deficiency-related symptoms, like loss of appetite and diarrhea, can compound the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional reporting by Alissa Hrustic and Kasandra Brabaw&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;PhotoAlto/Sigrid Olsson - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 20:29:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE1RbGFXU3VNWUtfOUk1ZkdUTFFrS285VzJHZGxrUUJPZmpOS2Z1ZENQaFlIVHN6YXJQTW9qVFVrbXJVa3JYaTJueU9CNWJ1c0R5Q3BLRC0xMmVmYXBFMkpacEFxOUx5dmhx</guid></item><item><title>第一张Ozempic的脸。现在人们正在处理Ozempic头发和肌肉损失- Vogue | First Came Ozempic Face.

So what gives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is this happening?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.23.25322568v2" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.23.25322568v2"}' href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.23.25322568v2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some studies&lt;/a&gt; link these drugs to hair loss, experts still say it is not a direct side effect of GLP-1s like Ozempic or other medications like Mounjaro. &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/drmarisagarshick/?hl=en" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/drmarisagarshick/?hl=en"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/drmarisagarshick/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Marisa Garshick&lt;/a&gt;, MD, board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology, explains that it’s actually more of an indirect result of rapid weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, or stress on the body. “&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430848/"&gt;Telogen effluvium&lt;/a&gt; is a type of hair shedding that may be noticed a few months after the body experiences some type of change or stress,” says Dr. Garshick. (It’s akin to the dramatic hair shedding some saw in the months post-COVID-19.) “People on GLP-1s may not actually notice hair shedding or thinning for several months after they are on it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for muscle loss, that’s just a general side effect of losing weight, regardless of whether the impetus is diet, exercise, surgery, or a medication like Ozempic. &lt;a data-offer-url="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1104010511/holly-f-lofton" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1104010511/holly-f-lofton"}' href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1104010511/holly-f-lofton" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="1104010511" data-aps-asc-tag="vogue0d-20"&gt;Holly Lofton&lt;/a&gt;, MD, director of the medical weight-management program at NYU Langone Health, tells &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt; that experts are seeing medications like Wegovy and Zepbound causing the same amount of muscle loss as one might experience through more traditional weight-loss methods—and sometimes more. Studies show that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9036397/"&gt;25 to 30% of the total weight loss&lt;/a&gt; caused by calorie restriction and exercise comes from lean body mass, which includes muscles. So if someone were to lose 20 pounds, she says, around five to six pounds of that might be muscle that is lost. Studies on medications like Wegovy and Zepbound show patients can lose roughly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10861994/"&gt;15 to 22% of their total weight&lt;/a&gt;, with about 25% of that weight loss being lean muscle mass. “These drugs are not necessarily muscle sparing,” she says. “However, because people tend to lose more total weight on these medications, the absolute amount of muscle loss can be greater, unless we intervene with resistance training and adequate protein intake.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can you do about it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things you can do to treat hair and muscle loss that you might experience when on these medications. Dr. Garshick notes that it is normal to shed approximately 50 to 100 hairs per day, so you should only be concerned if you notice significantly more hair falling out or if your hair loss persists for longer than three to six months. If that is the case, she recommends consulting a board-certified dermatologist for a proper evaluation. “Since telogen effluvium is considered a temporary process, once the weight stabilizes, it is possible the hair loss will slow down and hair regrowth will resume and normalize even without doing any specific intervention,” she says. “While this process can take 6 to 12 months, providing reassurance that it can get better on its own is often sufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She advises getting blood work done to see if there are hormonal changes or nutritional deficiencies that can be addressed through diet (making sure you are consuming enough protein is key) or the use of oral supplements like Nutrafol or Wellbel. You can also turn to thickening and volumizing shampoos, like the &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.ulta.com/p/hair-fall-defense-shampoo-pimprod2046063" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/FzrGcxRntjxTCUv9W25qpyQoDAqac26uX4LfuSRwhs9Pd2enkszF54LY2o6ADG7xxcm6SWvrW9Vee6FtVeK1sypDVZboeCvcYqLWPn6ezRsbbXChGh2TvQpWBvpkVyxc9xJzWjCvx8g4tm6h8pq2qkDnS3PHry45r5hwU77U9ibA"}' href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/FzrGcxRntjxTCUv9W25qpyQoDAqac26uX4LfuSRwhs9Pd2enkszF54LY2o6ADG7xxcm6SWvrW9Vee6FtVeK1sypDVZboeCvcYqLWPn6ezRsbbXChGh2TvQpWBvpkVyxc9xJzWjCvx8g4tm6h8pq2qkDnS3PHry45r5hwU77U9ibA" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nioxin Hair Fall Defense Shampoo&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.sephora.com/product/vegamour-gro-revitalizing-shampoo-for-thinning-hair-P473003" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/gVLYTFHP77FHrV3N7q97uEuuwba6T4FNPoCDtWKSe5BHZ5L5anFAhpi4j8KoJSMzhcP7bXCZYh3fyknwbTB7ckDZxYTJ4yKovny43JQcUN6gcUT3YPEFK2Qnn8CwFUpw6jmcV8xop4aqs3ybNd79h2N23fAvoNFgQUNdAPk1AV1Cb7CDfUAbzXttTSMn47t532cjnGzvuhT1m5vnDW"}' href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/gVLYTFHP77FHrV3N7q97uEuuwba6T4FNPoCDtWKSe5BHZ5L5anFAhpi4j8KoJSMzhcP7bXCZYh3fyknwbTB7ckDZxYTJ4yKovny43JQcUN6gcUT3YPEFK2Qnn8CwFUpw6jmcV8xop4aqs3ybNd79h2N23fAvoNFgQUNdAPk1AV1Cb7CDfUAbzXttTSMn47t532cjnGzvuhT1m5vnDW" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vegamour Gro Revitalizing Shampoo&lt;/a&gt;, and leave-in products like the &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Flourish-Density-Booster-Thinning-Treatment/dp/B09JVKY4CX" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/d5Zy5wnNZ5WxssT4g4qyMB2PYk3sF7NqDjbJ6LUDWfTnrZ2e2AxJdXsiMLpS42URje6RMkPNUfctHodmmqSWtDTLT9awnLuqCVnZi7UTyxKFWFxWmkpRV74VGTCYFkL8PCF2f5EQpoTFejV21cCvHxp8UCgWDoAJceo5bi4UewTcc3mYBPPsPdrHkoaM1Hf3NaL"}' href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/d5Zy5wnNZ5WxssT4g4qyMB2PYk3sF7NqDjbJ6LUDWfTnrZ2e2AxJdXsiMLpS42URje6RMkPNUfctHodmmqSWtDTLT9awnLuqCVnZi7UTyxKFWFxWmkpRV74VGTCYFkL8PCF2f5EQpoTFejV21cCvHxp8UCgWDoAJceo5bi4UewTcc3mYBPPsPdrHkoaM1Hf3NaL" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="B09JVKY4CX" data-aps-asc-tag="vogue0d-20"&gt;Virtue Flourish Density Booster&lt;/a&gt; to help increase hair density.

Also, because we have to know what tests and check ups you will need. For example: If you changed s*x from a man to a woman you still need a prostate exam because the inside of your body will always be that of a male human, cancer doesn't give a d**n.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et68t4q/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-51/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="desktop-in-content-ad post-ads "&gt; &lt;span class="dfp-ad" data-source="primis"&gt; &lt;span id="desktop-widget-loaded"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9057943"&gt;  &lt;p id="9057943" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facts-doctors-wish-everyone-knew-29-6880ccde25ac3-png__700.jpg" alt="Elderly woman wrapped in shawl eating dessert, highlighting health risks doctors warn about death machines." title="Elderly woman wrapped in shawl eating dessert, highlighting health risks doctors warn about death machines."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I'm not an MD, I'm an RN. Here's some real advice: do not let yourself grow old and obese. I will forgo any talk of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes; that's inside stuff and while I'm well educated on it, I want to talk of the outside stuff that will make your life miserable. I'm talking arthritis, skin breakdown, lack of hygiene and the depression that goes along with it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The arthritis starts because your bone structure is in no way designed to carry 3 to 4 times the normal body weight. The joints wear down, the bone spurs develop, the spinal stenosis kicks in, and you find that every movement is an orchestra of multiple different minor but irritating pains all shooting off at once. You can't get out of bed or up from a chair without several body parts giving out little screams of pain. You will get used to it, but you will not like it. And you will start moving less and less; you'll start weighing the decision to get up and go do some social activity versus the pain it will cause you and at some point, the pain wins out and you start going out less and less. In the most extreme cases you will start to alter how to go the bathroom or clean yourself because a trip to the toilet and all the maneuvering it takes will just be too much. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you start to move less and less, you start to clean yourself less and less, and the skin excoriation and fungal infections start to form in your various folds and crevices. You also have trouble fully wiping after a bowel movement, or you spill a little on yourself as you've adapted to using urinals instead of the toilet. Eventually your lack of movement and inability to clean yourself and exposure to bodily fluids leads to various ulcers that are painful and take a long time to heal. In the worst cases you can get a pressure ulcer that doesn't go away, is constantly exposed to fecal material, an infection starts and you eventually go septic and end up in the ICU. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So with this lack of movement and ability to fully clean self comes the obvious result of just smelling bad. I'm not trying to be an a*****e here, but the lack of hygiene will cause friends and family to avoid coming over, or going places with you, or just having any social contact beyond a phone call. The isolation will escalate, the depression will increase, your world becomes smaller and smaller and you just hate yourself for the trap you're in. It sucks but other people can only take so much. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And on top of it all, even at rest, you won't be comfortable. You can't breath properly when sleeping so you get a cpap at home, and while that takes care of properly oxygenating yourself while at rest, the aching joints and muscle spasms will prevent you from ever having a satisfying sleep again. You will always be tired, this just exacerbates all the problems I just mentioned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in the end, severe depression. Severe self hate. Feeling trapped in a body that's become a prison and at your age there's no way out. You're isolated, you're alone, and the friends and family you do have avoid visiting. When they do come around, you have to either ask them for help with all the things you've neglected to do because you physically can't (which they start to see coming, so they up and leave or just don't come by at all), or you just sit their and have a sad conversation that dances around the elephant in the room that is what's become of your life. It's sad, just all around sad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I didn't write this to be an a*****e, I wrote it because I see these types of people in the hospital and in home care regularly. In America the obesity epidemic is so prevalent, and it affects every aspect of a persons life. Obesity is a prison cell in and of itself. Now as an RN and as a human being, I'm not trying to judge you for why it happened, it is what it is, but please if you are seriously overweight or obese, now is the day to start doing something about it. Do not wait any longer. Do not hope for a magic cure. Do not deny what is happening. Make the changes, you are worth it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et64lj8/" target="_blank"&gt; 6202019 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/kind-elderly-woman-eating-pie-from-the-plate-with-appetite-while-sitting-on-the-bench-near-the-country-house-stock-photo-p0nk21q--Nk" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-33/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9057938"&gt;  &lt;p id="9057938" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facts-doctors-wish-everyone-knew-27-6880cb862083b-png__700.jpg" alt="Elderly hand showing signs of aging on a white fabric surface, highlighting doctors' insights on death machines." title="Elderly hand showing signs of aging on a white fabric surface, highlighting doctors' insights on death machines."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Actually a doctor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wish people would know that when I say, "I don't think CPR is in your/your relatives' best interests", I am not saying I am going to withdraw all treatment immediately. CPR is BRUTAL, and it has a much lower success rate (even if done promptly in hospital) than the movies make out. If you are old, or have a lot of medical problems, then the success rate goes down even more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I don't want to do CPR on you it's not because I want you to die, it's because I don't want to fracture your ribs, expose your body to a huge group of people you don't know (everyone loves attending a crash call), and repeatedly a*****t your dead body for nothing. I want you to die with dignity and care if there is no chance of bringing you back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In summary, CPR is great and everyone should learn how to do it, it does save lives. But, if a doctor suggests it should not be performed, please give serious thought to that. We don't suggest a DNACPR for no reason.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et5xqmb/" target="_blank"&gt; Persephone_88 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/persons-left-hand-on-white-textile-1sRJgrV4nwI" target="_blank"&gt; Bruce Tang / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-28/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to live a long, happy, and healthy life is to take such good care of yourself that you preemptively avoid (some) &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/infuriated-by-doctors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; before they arise.

Often, even if someone already knows what they should do, it won’t automatically make them do what they should. Developing new habits is difficult. And some habits take far longer to form than others. It depends on the activity itself, your character, and your environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to sports medicine psychologist Matthew Sacco, PhD, simpler habits are easier to form. “Something that you can do pretty frequently can get established quickly—in 18 days or so,” Sacco &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-form-a-habit-11716094" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Verywell Mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, complex activities take far longer to become automatic parts of our daily lives. “Something complex like exercise can take six-plus months to make it a really well-established habit.” That being said, the “minimum requirement to establish an exercise habit” is at least 6 weeks of exercising 4 times per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that you engage in &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, as well as 2 days of muscle-strengthening activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9057988"&gt;  &lt;p id="9057988" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I'm a nurse not a doctor but... All these fad diets that claim to "detoxify" you are nonsense. Your liver and kidneys are the only way you're getting detoxified, not some MLM magic vitamin pill that your co-worker sells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quit asking for antibiotics when you have a virus. It's literally doing nothing for you, except killing the good bacteria in your body, and it's creating super bacteria. Doctors, quit prescribing antibiotics when you know it's a virus because you just don't feel like arguing with Karen. I've seen this way too many times. "Karen" brings her kid with the sniffles to the ER and demands antibiotics. Doc prescribes them to shut Karen up and get her brat out of the ER. Stop it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vaccines aren't some big pharma conspiracy. They work. Big pharma is gonna f**k you by price gouging you, not in some crazy conspiracy to poison you. The amount of aluminium in a typical vaccine is a smaller amount than you consume in your everyday diet. There is no Mercury in children's vaccines. The mercury that's in multi-dose adult vaccines is not the same as the mercury that was in old thermometers. Many facilities ,such as mine, don't even use multi dose vials. Just because a chemical compound sounds scary doesn't mean it is scary. The vaccine schedule for children is fine. Not getting your kid the chicken pox vaccine is setting your kid up for shingles when they get older and that s**t is not fun. I get it, you had chicken pox when you were younger and you are ok. I hope you don't get shingles cause you are gonna regret having chicken pox. The pain from shingles is no joke.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et5xrnr/" target="_blank"&gt; Red142 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-78/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9057942"&gt;  &lt;p id="9057942" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Not a Dr. But l do have some advice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you're ever short of breath and it's unexplained ( not running while being a fat smoker like me)&lt;br&gt;GO SEE A DR. NOW.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For about 4 days prior to this past Christmas (2018) my wife (f29) was short of breath and felt generally crummy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We didn't think it was anything but a cold/allergies etc. &lt;br&gt;Christmas day she felt worse, didn't move much. So I told her that if she doesn't show improvement by the next morning (12/26/18, yes the dates are important, you'll see why)&lt;br&gt;That I would be forcing her to go to the ER and get checked out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She didn't have any improvement. Only worse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I took her to the ER around 4pm that day. When they took her back and got her hooked up she was at 40-45% O2 saturation. Which is bad. She was then sent by ambulance to the nearest hospital with an ICU. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For any Dr's in the house, there was about a golf ball size part of her lungs that showed black on the x-ray, the rest was white........&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By 10pm that day she had dropped to 10-15% o2 saturation and was immediately put on a ventilator and was kept asleep for 2 weeks. She was, at most, a few hours from dying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She had pneumonia and sepsis in both lungs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to the amount of meds they gave her, and being dehydrated already her kidneys took a hard hit. She had dialysis 6 times in the hospital.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After 37 days in the hospital, 14 of which she was in and out of consciousness, she remembers not being able to talk and trying to write some stuff on a paper, she was released.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last week (July 1st ish) we got blood work back that her kidneys were finally back to 99.6% function.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et5rslc/" target="_blank"&gt; Goodwynn89 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-32/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which of these medical professionals’ insights surprised you the most?

I can only see patients record if they were in my hospital or in the neighbouring hospital otherwise i have to call their family doc, who may or may not be at all times available.

Having 4 drinks spread out over a few hours can be JUST as fun as having 10 drinks in the same time span, AND you're not putting yourself at risk for massive organ failure and making yourself look like an idiot. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et5th67/" target="_blank"&gt; Mosessbro &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-group-of-people-sitting-around-each-other-r9hE0Fk6Ock" target="_blank"&gt; A F / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-35/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9057915"&gt;  &lt;p id="9057915" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facts-doctors-wish-everyone-knew-3-6880a5ca7d888-png__700.jpg" alt="Person wrapping hand with medical bandage, highlighting doctors' warnings about death machines and health risks." title="Person wrapping hand with medical bandage, highlighting doctors' warnings about death machines and health risks."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Don’t do DIY surgery or hold off on reporting things that are obvious warning signs.

Feed your d**n baby!!! The badge of honor you get for exclusively breastfeeding isn’t real. Dehydration, severe hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, these are all real and happen all the time. Feed your baby!! Lots of hospitals will even let you use donor breast milk initially if you’re strongly opposed to formula. Just feed your baby. And don’t use a cup or a spoon. The lactation consultants will tell you that babies know how to lap it up. Well, you didn’t give birth to a kitten. If your baby has an intact suck reflex you should use it. It allows the gag reflex to work better. If you feel strongly about the concept of n****e confusion (it’s not a thing) then ask for a SNS System. Tape that tiny tube to a b**b and let your kid eat that way. Just feed your baby. Also, this nonsense about how a baby only needs a few drops of milk in the beginning because their stomach is only the size of a walnut. True, their stomach is small. But much like most other stomachs it stretches and empties pretty readily into the small intestine. Plenty of babies eat a full ounce right out the gate. Errrr, vag. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, if you have a home birth and your kid ends up coming to the hospital by EMS please let us do our job. If you don’t want any of the care we offer then please refuse EMS. Or don’t even call them to begin with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edited: but wait there’s more. I don’t give a s**t if you don’t want hepatitis B vaccine at delivery, you can take that up with your pediatrician. I don’t really care about erythromycin either, unless you’re unclean. But vitamin K. Don’t skip that. It prevents bleeding. It’s a big deal. Babies don’t make their own vitamin K until their gut has sufficient substrate and time to. It’s a key part of the clotting cascade. If it were well absorbed orally we would give it that way, we’re not sadistic pricks that like to give shots to newborn babies for grins. We give it that way because it actually works that way.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et6h6m6/" target="_blank"&gt; tobmom &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-55/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9058001"&gt;  &lt;p id="9058001" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facts-doctors-wish-everyone-knew-13-6880c14602456-png__700.jpg" alt="Man with tattoos covering face with arms, lying in bed looking exhausted, illustrating doctors' warnings on health risks." title="Man with tattoos covering face with arms, lying in bed looking exhausted, illustrating doctors' warnings on health risks."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;If there could be a public service announcement about how utterly miserable it is to die by paracetomol o******e, that would great.

Don't be embarrassed by your body. Having said that, if you are concerned about anything, ask your doctor. We have generally heard it all before, and trust me, we have (nearly always) seen it all before. Maybe you have something that has been bothering you for ages, but you were too scared or embarrassed to ask about it ... Just ask! It might be 'nothing' and you have been stressing about it for no reason. And if not, then you are at least one step closer to getting it fixed. No one can help if they don't know. There are no stupid questions, so ask away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm always amazed when I have been asked about something that has been bothering a patient for years and years, but they were too embarrassed / scared to bring it up. Most of the time, it is nothing / a completely normal body function / feature. Other times, it is something that should have been discussed right away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YOU know your body best. So speak up! Don't wait for the doctor to "ask the right question".&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et5ud4j/" target="_blank"&gt; frangipani_c &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-man-sitting-at-a-desk-in-front-of-another-man-nAcqvTvOgi4" target="_blank"&gt; Yunus Tuğ / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-29/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9058068"&gt;  &lt;p id="9058068" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/facts-doctors-wish-everyone-knew-15-6880c2725c1bd-png__700.jpg" alt="Close-up of a dentist using a dental mirror to examine the mouth of a patient at a medical clinic." title="Close-up of a dentist using a dental mirror to examine the mouth of a patient at a medical clinic."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Teeth are the most disrespected body part.

It’s shocking how many people don’t know the anatomy of women. The urethra is where your pee comes from. It is also where bacteria can enter and cause a UTI. No a UTI is not a STD. And it isn’t in your v****a. It’s in your urinary tract. Yes you need to go see a doctor because that infection can travel all the way up to your kidneys and eventually into your bloodstream and you will end up septic. &lt;br&gt;Also a yeast infection is not the same thing. Often you get them after a dose of antibiotics that caused an overgrowth of yeast in the v****a. And husbands/boyfriends, familiarize yourself so you can be understanding. She is not gross. She could have some anatomical problems and chronic UTIs. It can happen to you too. You just got blessed with a urethra that has a longer distance from the entrance to the bladder.

Just one example - antioxidants are like gas for your car. You can store up a certain amount of vitamins, but your tank can only hold so much. If you binge and overfill your tank, it doesn't do anything (you excrete it out as waste), and you can't expect to go the next several months without gas just because you tried to overload it before. You're going to still need to get gas. Same goes for your fruits and veggies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Had someone tell me he went vegetarian for a few weeks, which meant he was done for the year. He was dead serious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Had a patient at risk for heart failure try to insist that if she stayed away from salt entirely for x days/weeks, she should be able to have her fill of McDonald's fries and ramen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Had a smoker argue that if he stopped for some time, he should be able to smoke freely for a while.

That being said, depression involves changes in your brain chemistry which can be reversed or mitigated by taking the right medications. You need both for an optimal recovery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Treat your body with the same care as your most prized possession - because it *is* your most prized possession.

Prevention is becoming more and more important in medicine, and treating a disease in its early stages is a lot better than catching it late. If you have family members who had ovarian or colon cancer in their 30s, that is very significant for your own risk. The screening and tests we run might change, depending. If you want to start the pill, it's important to know about breast cancer, DVTs, clotting disorders in the family. If you're a bit overweight and have no metabolic syndrome problems in the family, compared to a bit overweight but both your parents have type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the management priorities change. Asking your family about any recurring diseases or diseases that occurred early (20s, 30s, maybe 40s) can be helpful. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are certain common conditions that are underdiagnosed but easily fixed. Even if you have non-specific symptoms, it doesn't hurt to tell your doctor during the next visit. About 5% of US adults have an iron deficiency which can cause loss of concentration and fatigue, and a huge amount are vitamin D deficient. When I am able to complete a systems review (ask screening questions about every different body system) I end up discovering a lot of irritable bowel syndrome, hypothyroidism, insomnia, joint pain, headaches, etc that impact quality of life. But people don't bring it up because they don't want to be a bother, or think the symptoms are too vague.

Some pearls I've picked up:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;# The colon is in general air-tight. Therefore your d***o ALWAYS needs a flared base. Once it gets up past the point that I can grab it out, it's vacuum sealed in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;# If you don't smoke cigarettes, if you wear your seatbelt, and if you don't drink and drive, you've just greatly increased your chances of avoiding a tragic end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;# No one really knows when they're going to die. With that in mind, have a plan. Talk to your family about your end-of-life care wishes. I had a 90 year old the other day with terminal cancer and 6 kids and they had evidently never thought their mom was going to die. Are you sure she would really want "everything"? Intubation, CPR (bye bye, sternum), central line (giant iv in the neck)....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;# A child's fever is in the overwhelming majority of cases a healthy response to an infection. It wouldn't be unusual to expect 6 fevers a year during the toddler years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;# The body is astoundingly complex and what counts as "disease" vs that which is a normal and a temporary aberration from the mean is a philosophically rich and unanswered question. Therefore, no amount of testing may ever reveal what is "wrong", which begs the question as to whether anything is actually wrong. All pathology reveals itself with enough time. A twinge here, 2 sneezes, a faint discoloration of the skin. Sometimes these are best left unexplained and you can save yourself the ambulance ride.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et5uhvx/" target="_blank"&gt; dryyyyyycracker &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-69/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9057972"&gt;  &lt;p id="9057972" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Take care of your feet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you can't feel your feet, check your feet regularly to make sure they're clean, dry, and haven't started developing any sores.

When you don’t get regular checkups and take regular care, it’s not like you’ll notice something bad happening right away. Just like how you won’t notice a missed oil change a couple thousand miles later. But diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, alcohol dependence, etc, they all sneak up on you. Just like how eventually, that engine won’t run as smooth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second thing is that your body isn’t like a TV remote, where you pop out the old batteries and put in some new ones. You can’t expect to come into a hospital and walk out feeling 100%. People have some unrealistic expectations of what doctors can do, and there is research which demonstrates how TV shows provide the public with these false beliefs (I’m a Grey’s fan also, but it’s not real medicine). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first line treatment for most of our common diseases is...wait for it... lifestyle modification. It’s not d***s. It’s not surgery. 50% of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics do not require anything more than diet and exercise. Cessation of smoking is the second best thing you can do for your health, and every little amount you decrease smoking has a profound impact. Again, you won’t see it now, but you’ll see it down the road (like the oil change). And if you do need meds (like how most will eventually need meds for their blood pressure), don’t play around with it. Take it every day. Hypertension is called the silent k**ler. You can’t really feel your blood pressure. But it’s slowly damaging every artery and every organ in your body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that comes down to the last point. Exercising is the key to a better life. If you put in the work, there is no upper limit. That’s not an exaggeration, but the findings of a landmark paper that made news everywhere last October. Not exercising is worse than smoking, diabetes, or coronary artery disease. It is the single best thing you can do for a healthier life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your health is a shared responsibility, and we’re here to help. This may not be the flashiest Reddit comment. But this one may actually save your life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;——-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: so I’m getting a lot of great questions on what are good exercises and how long should you be exercising. This is probably the single most asked question I get from my parents friends and random strangers. Unfortunately it’s a bit complicated. I could go on quoting tons of papers from a variety of sources, but that would be difficulty to parse though. An exercise regimen should ideally be set by at a medical professional specifically for you. It may vary based on your age, occupation, underlying health conditions, fitness goals, etc. I couldn’t give a 60 year old with COPD the same instructions as a 25 year old. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don’t want to say something in a reddit comment that would end up hurting you or your loved one, so I won’t go into specifics. The generic advice we give to our older patients is to “walk at a brisk pace, enough for a mild sweat”. There is some evidence to show that even normal walking can significantly help improve your cardiac health. I’m only focusing on cardiovascular health here, and there are other things to consider with exercise. I don’t want to sound annoying, but I really feel it’s best you talk to your doctor about what else you can do to improve your health. We’d be glad to walk you though a plan made specifically for you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, regarding number of steps per day. The 10,000 steps number is unscientific and largely propagated by the pedometer making industry. First it should be age adjusted. It also doesn’t directly correlate with losing weight. However, personally, as someone approaching 30, I do like 10,000. It’s a nice clean number and I can make a game out of it for myself. It is important to note that this is not for everyone.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca3ije/doctors_of_reddit_what_is_something_that_you_wish/et5psel/" target="_blank"&gt; z3roTO60 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-woman-in-a-white-lab-coat-is-listening-to-a-woman-in-a-white-coat-E3nAJw_GHqQ" target="_blank"&gt; Pablo Merchán Montes / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9681-11/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-full-list-block "&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note: this post originally had &lt;a class="open-list-full-list-link" href="https://www.boredpanda.com/facts-doctors-wish-everyone-knew/?all_submissions=true&amp;amp;media_id=9057921"&gt;76 images&lt;/a&gt;.

And, there are other nuances to consider when it comes to striking the right protein balance, like whether someone has pre-existing health conditions and/or how active they are. Plus, it's important to consider what qualifies as a “high-protein” diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, we talked to experts to separate fact from fiction when it comes to high-protein diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, M.D., medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA; &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephani-Johnson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stephani Johnson;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stephani Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, D.C.N., R.D.N., adjunct professor in the Department of Clinical and Preventive Nutrition Sciences at Rutgers University School of Health Professions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much protein do you need per day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234922/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommended daily allowance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;recommended daily allowance&lt;/a&gt; (RDA) of protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram per day for people age 18 and up. That ends up translating to about 55 grams of protein per day for a 150-pound person, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the RDA for protein hasn’t changed in decades, and there is some debate on whether it should be higher, especially in people who are active. &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a64591955/how-much-protein-do-i-need-to-build-muscle/#how-much-protein-do-i-need-to-build-muscle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Some experts say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Some experts say&lt;/a&gt; up to two grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day is a better goal for certain groups. That would be as much as 136 grams of protein per day for that same 150-pound person.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with most things in nutrition, though, how much protein you need per day is personal, and best discussed with your doctor or a registered dietitian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are high-protein diets dangerous?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some common—but unproven or very dependent on context—claims about high-protein diets or protein supplementation include that too much protein could cause fat gain, kidney problems, or even raise the risk of certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these ideas are out there, a lot of the concerns around high-protein diets either haven’t been directly proven or stem from people who have underlying health conditions, points out &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, M.D., medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t found any evidence that high-protein diets are harmful for most people,” Dr. Ali says. “People with certain medical conditions—patients with kidney issues or problems metabolizing protein—have to be more careful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32669325/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Researchers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Researchers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; suggested that high-protein diets may be hard on your kidneys, says &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephani-Johnson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stephani Johnson;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stephani Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, D.C.N., R.D.N., adjunct professor in the Department of Clinical and Preventive Nutrition Sciences at Rutgers University School of Health Professions. But this is “&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1408424/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:suggestive data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;suggestive data&lt;/a&gt;” as one scientific analysis points out. Meaning, researchers haven’t proven that a high-protein diet leads to kidney issues, and in fact, this specific analysis found the opposite—higher protein diets (especially if they're plant-based) were associated with a lower risk of chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Johnson says that not all high-protein diets are created equal. “High-protein diets can vary significantly based on the sources of protein consumed,” she says. People who eat high-protein diets rich in saturated fat have a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34649831/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:greater risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;greater risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing cardiovascular disease than those who have a high-protein diet with less saturated fat, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a red meat-rich high-protein diet also carries risks: “Although not solely attributed to high protein intake, excessive consumption of red meat has been consistently associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer,” Johnson says. But, she says, people who eat a lot of red meat aren’t necessarily on a high-protein diet—and you can be on a high-protein diet without eating red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for claims that too much protein will make you gain fat, Dr. Ali says it’s possible, but unlikely. “If you’re having so much protein that you’re getting in more calories than your body needs, you can gain weight,” he says. But given that protein is filling, Dr. Ali says it’s “hard to overdo it” with this macronutrient. “It’s harder to have more than your body needs with protein than with carbohydrates,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to calculate a safe upper limit for yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there’s still a lot that scientists are figuring out in relation to high-protein diets, but there is some guidance. The RDA cited above is the minimum amount most generally healthy people need to hit to avoid having health issues, Johnson notes. So, you can probably have more than that with no issue, provided you don’t have any underlying health conditions. But it’s always a good idea to talk to your healthcare provider before making any diet changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For generally healthy individuals, protein intake of up to two grams per kilogram of body weight—approximately one gram per pound—is typically considered safe,” Johnson says. “At this level, the kidneys are generally able to manage the nitrogen load associated with protein metabolism without strain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else should you keep in mind about high-protein diets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While protein has a lot going for it, Johnson says it’s still important to focus on getting the other macronutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When protein intake is significantly increased, intake of carbohydrates and fats decreases,” she says. “Carbohydrate-rich foods provide a wide variety of essential nutrients not commonly found in high-protein foods. As a result, individuals following a very high-protein, low-carbohydrate, and low-fat diet may be at risk of inadequate nutrient intake, which can lead to negative health outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having too little fiber is also a concern with high-protein diets, Johnson says. That can raise the risk of digestive issues, along with deficiencies in vitamins and minerals like B vitamins, vitamins C and E, and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, Dr. Ali says a high-protein diet is generally safe for most people. If you’re interested in ramping up your protein intake, Johnson recommends checking in with your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to make sure there are no potential issues, especially if you have any underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 19:30:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE4yQ2VYdkJhX2k2TExTTTNFeDFHUk56ZXM1TkM5ZkNaVWtWYXBORXZ2MFItREVRYTJLOW5BbXRoV1dVTjhabXRjYlBsTTAxVXUwMVJidHd0SWg1dDRaMGljdGFtemdhUl9kSVZkcllyY2Y</guid></item><item><title>您锌含量低的1号迹象-预防 | The Number-1 Sign You’re Low on Zinc - Prevention</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNZDlWY2pzcl9ZOGNHNGhvR2NpZ3h6YXVOQjgxSUlQVEM2Q190XzBUSHJON3JNcm9qUGppNmZWVFZhdzlLM2dDOVFXNWJlaXNCUzBqbWZNX1hmZFZ3WnB2NGdIRlRLVnl3bmlQWndOc1BYUDBGeHhzb1plV2dKalQ1TlA1aw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;main id="main-content" class="css-rk6tbh ewq0ot92"&gt;&lt;p id="gpt-leaderboard-ad" suppresshydrationwarning class="css-1rauiqq ewg5wdb1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="listicle" data-journey-hide="true" class="listicle-container content-container listicle-body-content css-4rmlxi e13lia4i20"&gt;&lt;section data-ad-index="0" class="css-t6ry6e e13lia4i18"&gt;&lt;section id="slide-1" data-anchor-id="slide-1" data-journey-listicle-slide="true" class="css-1rz4ih8 e16kmapv11"&gt;&lt;div data-theme-key="listicle-slide-inner-container" data-journey-content="true" class="listicle-slides css-13j5f4r e16kmapv10"&gt;&lt;div data-theme-key="listicle-slide-inner-container" class="css-1l3nada e16kmapv9"&gt;&lt;h2 data-theme-key="listicle-slide-item-title" class="css-1vi44h6 e16kmapv8"&gt;Slow-healing wounds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="css-1gomreu e16kmapv0"&gt;&lt;div data-theme-key="listicle-slide-item-image" class="css-1vei6hc eutn2uj2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-7jdyxr e1nfup6f1"&gt;&lt;img srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/woman-sitting-with-ice-pack-on-knee-royalty-free-image-1752701442.pjpeg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.0629xw,0&amp;amp;resize=480:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/woman-sitting-with-ice-pack-on-knee-royalty-free-image-1752701442.pjpeg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.0629xw,0&amp;amp;resize=980:* 980w" alt="woman sitting with ice pack on knee" data-cy="slide-image-1" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/woman-sitting-with-ice-pack-on-knee-royalty-free-image-1752701442.pjpeg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.0629xw,0&amp;amp;resize=980:*" title="Woman sitting with ice pack on knee" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-1am3yn9 e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-dgbau5 e1geg53v2"&gt;PhotoAlto/Odilon Dimier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-tjljl5 e1geg53v0"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-dgbau5 e1geg53v1"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-theme-key="listicle-slide-item-meta" class="css-18oiw2p e16kmapv6"&gt;&lt;div class="css-hru0c2 e16kmapv7"&gt;&lt;p class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Zinc deficiency symptoms can range a lot, depending on your age.

data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, this lack of documentation has resulted in a relatively basic understanding of the impact of menstrual cycles on health, as well as the underdiagnosis and neglect of concerns related to menstruation such as pain and heavy bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These menstrual cycle characteristics can be indicators for conditions such as diabetes, thyroid disorders, polycystic ovarian syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In &lt;a

collected by healthcare professionals, unlike other measures such as BMI, blood pressure and cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More than a quarter of women in England are living with a serious reproductive health issue, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/10/one-in-four-women-england-reproductive-health-issue-survey" data-link-name="in body

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Almost a fifth (19%) of women who took part in the study experienced severe period pain in the last year, and 40% of respondents reported heavy menstrual bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/11/medical-misogyny-condemns-women-to-years-of-gynaecological-pain-mps-told" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;report by the women and equalities parliamentary committee&lt;/a&gt; last year found that women and girls are enduring years of pain because their reproductive conditions are being dismissed due to “medical misogyny”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Ranee Thakar, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “Serious conditions like fibroids and endometriosis can have a devastating impact on almost every aspect of a person’s life, including impacting their physical and mental health, and their ability to work and socialise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Too often systemic, operational, structural and cultural issues mean women do not get the care they deserve and our current system risks entrenching the health inequalities we can see in these findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="01c5c490-0a9b-4a0c-affc-2f04a8bf9758" data-spacefinder-role="richLink"

              &lt;p&gt;A 55-year-old man’s swollen toes and fingers turned out to have a much stranger explanation than expected. In a recent case report, the man’s doctors detailed how some of his bones were “completely replaced” by metastatic tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors in Australia &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/image-challenge?ci=20250710"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; the case earlier this month in the New England Journal of Medicine. The man visited the hospital after weeks of having pain and swelling in one finger and one toe. They soon discovered the symptoms were an unusual complication of the man’s earlier diagnosed metastatic squamous-cell lung cancer. Tragically, he soon died after.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The man, as it turned out, had acrometastases—or cancers that had spread beyond his lungs to the bones past his elbows and knees. Acrometastases are incredibly rare, only &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8471162/"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to occur in 0.1% of cases where cancer spreads to the bones. Though they’re sometimes the first sign of a hidden late-stage cancer, they’re more often preceded by other noticeable symptoms, as in this case. The condition is typically caused by cancers of the lung, gastrointestinal tract, and urinary tract; it’s also more common in men.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the man had experienced six weeks of painful swelling in his right middle finger and right big toe, along with an open wound under the toe’s fingernail. The swollen appendages were also firm and tender to touch. Acrometastases can superficially resemble gout or osteomyelitis, the report authors noted. But X-rays easily revealed the cause behind the man’s symptoms: cancerous lesions that had “completely replaced” the outermost bones of his finger and toe.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Images of the man’s finger and toe can be seen &lt;a href="https://x.com/NEJM/status/1945861135263244710"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in an X post from the NEJM, and also embedded below.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because acrometastases are usually the result of highly advanced cancer, people’s odds of survival once they develop it are already low. People are typically expected to live less than six months after diagnosis. In this case, the doctors opted to treat the patient with palliative radiotherapy, which is intended to alleviate the symptoms of cancer rather than to eradicate it. The man died about three weeks later from &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572109/"&gt;refractory hypercalcemia&lt;/a&gt;, or dangerously high levels of calcium in the blood that don’t respond to standard treatment. This condition is often a complication of cancer as well.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s bad news for carboholics. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research suggests that eating bread, pasta and other grain products may trigger or worsen a wide range of psychological symptoms, including depression, anxiety and even schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that some people could be especially at risk, with these mealtime staples quietly sabotaging their brains every time they take a bite. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A protein widely found in bread, pasta and other grains could be why some people are depressed or anxious.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key culprit, researchers theorize, is gluten.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This naturally occurring protein — found in wheat, barley and rye — acts as a binder that gives baked goods and other foods their structure and chew.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For most, it’s harmless. But in others, gluten sensitivity can trigger a range of unpleasant symptoms, including bloating, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, headaches and joint pain, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21622-gluten-intolerance" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;In more serious cases, it can develop into celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder in which the body mistakes gluten for a harmful invader, like a virus. The resulting immune response triggers inflammation and damage in the small intestine — but the effects may go far beyond digestion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Inflammation that starts in the gut doesn’t stay in the gut. [It] can have a damaging effect on the brain,” Dr. Emeran Mayer, a gastroenterologist and neuroscientist, told &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/risking-it/202306/it-wasnt-adhd-or-anxiety-it-was-gluten"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When immune cells are activated, the vagus nerve system sends a signal to the brain that can trigger fatigue and depression-like behavior,” he noted. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Most traditional bread products contain gluten.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;bukhta79 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In children, that can look like irritability or symptoms of ADHD. In adults, it may show up as brain fog, mood disorders or more serious psychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take depression, for example. While around &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;8% of the general population&lt;/a&gt; is diagnosed with major depressive disorder at some point in their lives, studies suggest that people with celiac disease are hit much harder — with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4763959/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;some research putting the rate as high as 30%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Celiac disease has also been linked to a greater risk of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11633532/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3641836/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;panic disorder&lt;/a&gt; and even schizophrenia. In fact, &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2004/celiac-schizophrenia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found that people with celiac are three times more likely to develop schizophrenia than those without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond inflammation, research suggests that damage to the gut lining caused by gluten sensitivity may also contribute to these mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That damage can &lt;a href="https://thejemfoundation.com/gluten-and-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;interfere with the absorption of nutrients&lt;/a&gt; essential for brain function, including B vitamins, iron, vitamin D, magnesium and zinc. Deficiencies in any of these can lead to a variety of psychological symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Some studies suggest a potential link between celiac disease and an increased risk of developing schizophrenia. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;andriano_cz – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Scientists have also found that people with schizophrenia often &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4476307/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;test positive for high levels of antibodies linked to gluten sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, hinting at a possible connection between the two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These antibodies can cross the placenta, and &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/maternal-gluten-sensitivity-linked-to-schizophrenia-risk-in-children" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that mothers with elevated levels may increase the risk of psychosis in their children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know everything. But it’s another step closer connecting the dots about these illnesses,” Deanna L. Kelly, a psychiatry professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who has spent the past 15 years leading clinical trials in schizophrenia and severe mental illness, told &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/the-professor-who-believes-eating-bread-could-be-making-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can a gluten-free diet help?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research is mixed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nutrition-research-reviews/article/progression-of-coeliac-disease-its-neurological-and-psychiatric-implications/0FEE9E54B80338FD7A7E3637FCA085E9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Some studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that a gluten-free diet can ease anxiety, depression and neurological complications in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Some people with gluten sensitivity experience mood changes, including depression. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;SHOTPRIME STUDIO – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18622804/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one trial&lt;/a&gt;, participants with celiac reported lower anxiety levels after following a gluten-free diet for a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But others show no significant improvement — and in some cases, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20533598/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;anxiety levels remained elevated&lt;/a&gt; even after cutting gluten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some experts think part of the problem may come from the psychological stress of managing a chronic health condition.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“Being on a gluten-free diet can also lead to some of these psychiatric or mental health issues, because you have to be somewhat hyper-vigilant,” Debra Silberg, a gastroenterologist and chief science officer at Beyond Celiac, told &lt;a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/mental-health-issues-and-celiac-disease-are-linked-a-gluten-free-diet-can"&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s also a fear of going out and becoming exposed to gluten,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across the country, about 1 in every 133 people — roughly 1% of the US population — is estimated to have celiac disease, according to &lt;a href="https://www.beyondceliac.org/celiac-disease/facts-and-figures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Beyond Celiac&lt;/a&gt;. That adds up to around 2 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe the number of people affected by gluten intolerance is much higher. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5677194/#:~:text=Currently%2C%201%25%20of%20the%20United,of%20the%20United%20States%20public." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Studies estimate&lt;/a&gt; that about 6% of the US population — or roughly 20 million people — may be sensitive to gluten.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 24, PHMDC posted a food and symptom history questionnaire on its website. The link was distributed widely through a press release and on social media. All persons who experienced symptoms after eating food from the restaurant during October 22–24 were asked to complete the questionnaire. Respondents were asked to provide the names of other persons who had eaten food from the restaurant and become ill. The hospital provided PHMDC with the names of nine patients who sought care during October 23–24 after eating at the restaurant. On October 25, PHMDC contacted persons on this list who had not completed a questionnaire and asked them to complete the questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During October 24–30, PHMDC received 208 responses; 101 were excluded from analysis because they contained 1) mostly incomplete information, 2) the name of a fictional character, 3) names or addresses that included marijuana or THC-related words, or 4) information that indicated the person did not actually eat food from the restaurant. The remaining 107 responses were considered valid (&lt;a id="F2_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#F2_down"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt;). An outbreak-associated case of THC intoxication was defined as at least one of the following signs or symptoms (&lt;a id="T1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T1_down"&gt;Table&lt;/a&gt;): dizziness, sleepiness, anxiety, short term memory impact or time distortion, increased heart rate, nausea, paranoia, panic attack, increased blood pressure, vomiting, or hallucinations in a person who ate pizza, garlic bread, cheese bread, or a grinder (submarine sandwich) purchased from the restaurant during October 22–24, with symptom onset within 5 hours of eating the restaurant’s food. Eighty-five persons met the case definition for THC intoxication. Median time from eating food to symptom onset was 1 hour (range = 0–4 hours). Forty-seven persons meeting the case definition were male, and 38 were female; median age was 43 years (range = 1–91 years). Thirty-three persons consulted a health care provider (28 in a hospital ED and five elsewhere), and three were hospitalized for at least 1 night. Based on self-reporting in the questionnaire comments and information from the hospital, 15 persons received a positive test result for THC (&lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/182880#tabs-3"&gt;Supplementary Figure&lt;/a&gt;). Information about whether THC testing was performed was not available from the other 70 respondents. Eight persons (9%) were children and adolescents aged &amp;lt;18 years, none of whom was hospitalized. Dizziness was the only symptom reported for the youngest child (aged 1 year) with “not sure” indicated for all other symptoms in the questionnaire. Four children, aged &amp;lt;13 years (range = 3–8 years), had symptoms of dizziness (four), nausea (four), sleepiness (four), vomiting (three), anxiety (two), paranoia (one), short-term memory impact or time distortion (one), hallucinations (one), head or neck pain (one), and a heavy head (one). Respondents were asked to provide the names of other persons who ate food from the restaurant and became ill; eight additional persons who became ill after eating at the restaurant were identified, but none completed a questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 24, PHMDC issued a press release alerting the public via social media not to eat leftover pizza purchased from the restaurant during October 22–24. This information was updated on October 28 to include leftover grinders, garlic bread, and cheese bread. The updated information was shared with the public via social media and PHMDC’s blog, which is posted to the PHMDC website and emailed to approximately 3,000 subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

The recent news stories of cardiac arrests among athletes have certainly put a spotlight on this type of medical emergency and the potentially lifesaving steps bystanders can take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Retired wrestler Hulk Hogan died on July 24. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is Cardiac Arrest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiac arrest is when your heart stops completely and is no longer pumping blood to your vital organs, like the brain, liver and kidneys,” Dr. Comilla Sasson, the vice president for science and innovation for emergency cardiovascular care at the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="American Heart Association" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.heart.org/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;, told HuffPost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiac arrest can stem from a known heart condition or occur suddenly and unexpectedly. The most common cause is ventricular fibrillation ― a type of arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat. It’s an electrical disturbance that prevents the heart from doing its job properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s been some speculation that what happened to Damar Hamlin was something called commotio cordis,” Sasson said. “Something hits you in the chest ― blunt chest trauma ― and does it at the exact time your heart is contracting. That sets your heart into an irregular rhythm, ventricular fibrillation, so your heart can no longer pump like it should, leading to cardiac arrest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commotio cordis was first described &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/circep.111.962712" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="in the context of 18th-century laborers" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/circep.111.962712" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;in the context of 18th-century laborers&lt;/a&gt;, but more recently this sort of blunt trauma event has tended to occur in sports like baseball, hockey, lacrosse and football. Although several medical experts have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BAshbyMD/status/1610110420584472578" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="pointed to commotio cordis" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://twitter.com/BAshbyMD/status/1610110420584472578" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;pointed to commotio cordis&lt;/a&gt; as a potential explanation for Hamlin’s cardiac arrest, they’ve also emphasized that the public is not privy to the personal medical information necessary to identify a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Genetic conditions can make your heart have an irregular heart rhythm,” Sasson said. “&lt;span&gt;Athletes can also be prone to something called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,” she added, describing it as a thickening of heart muscle that is sometimes seen among elite athletes engaged in heavy training.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone admitted to the hospital following cardiac arrest will undergo testing to determine a cause and treatment protocol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart Attacks vs. Cardiac Arrest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although people often use the terms “cardiac arrest” and “heart attack” interchangeably, they are different medical events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heart attack, in the colloquial sense, is what we would refer to as an acute myocardial infarction,” said Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist and the director of the cardiac intensive care unit at &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/locations/morningside" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mount Sinai Morningside" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mountsinai.org/locations/morningside" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Mount Sinai Morningside&lt;/a&gt;. “Some of the heart muscle is severely jeopardized or dies, typically due to an insufficiency of oxygen supply compared to demand for oxygen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, there’s an artery blockage that prevents oxygen-rich blood from reaching part of the heart, and if it’s not reopened quickly, that section can die. So in a heart attack, the heart is still pumping, but the blood supply is cut off. With a cardiac arrest, the heart is not pumping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Kirk Irwin via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kirk Irwin via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest during the first quarter of a game against the Cincinnati Bengals in 2023.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A heart attack or myocardial infarction can be the inciting cause for a cardiac arrest, but the two are distinct,” Tomey said. “Most heart attacks do not cause cardiac arrest. However, a sizable percent of cardiac arrests result from some type of heart attack.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a cardiac arrest happens quickly, the symptoms of a heart attack more often build slowly (though they can be immediate as well).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Many patients will have a heart attack and slowly feel the classic symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath,” said Dr. Lawrence Phillips, a cardiologist at the &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="NYU Langone Health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nyulangone.org/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;NYU Langone Health&lt;/a&gt; medical center. “They then come to the emergency room hopefully early, where professionals diagnose a heart attack and open up the blood vessel that has the blockage using catheters and stents. There can be damage to the heart muscle, but we can decrease that risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a cardiac arrest, it’s important to immediately start providing emergency care, as every minute makes a difference for the chance of survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When someone has a cardiac arrest, it’s really an acute cessation of the heart’s ability to provide blood, usually from an arrhythmia, so the heart is not able to pump,” Phillips said. “It’s often very abrupt. Someone will slump over or collapse. We try to use whatever means we have to bring them back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Importance Of CPR For Treating Cardiac Arrest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://cpr.heart.org/en/resources/cpr-facts-and-stats#:" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="estimates" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://cpr.heart.org/en/resources/cpr-facts-and-stats#:" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that more than 356,000 cardiac arrests occur outside a hospital in the U.S. each year, and about 90% result in death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a range of outcomes for individuals who survive cardiac arrest,” Tomey said. “The best outcome is to return to your baseline level of function physically and neurologically. Some individuals will survive but have some degree of residual neurologic impairment, and the degree can range quite widely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your best chance at improving someone’s outcome after cardiac arrest is to act fast by administering CPR. In the case of Hamlin, the NFL confirmed that he received CPR on the field, and others present reported the use of an automated external defibrillator, or AED, as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once cardiac arrest starts, blood flow stops,” said Dr. John Bozinovski, a cardiac surgeon at &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;. “Two organs that are quite sensitive to lack of blood supply are the brain and heart, with the brain being exquisitely sensitive to injury. If blood circulation is not restored, brain injury can start within minutes and become irreversible shortly thereafter. The longer the lack the blood flow, the greater and more extensive the injury to the brain and other organs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPR is a way to restore blood flow, using mechanical energy to move blood to the vital organs. By doing chest compressions, you essentially act as a person’s heart while theirs isn’t working. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The prompt administration of CPR can double or triple likelihood of survival by getting oxygen back to the body,” Phillips noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you don’t have to be formally CPR-certified to perform the lifesaving procedure. The American Heart Association recommends using “hands-only CPR” in the event of a cardiac emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Conventional CPR, which is typically used by trained health care providers, utilizes chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth breathing, whereas hands-only CPR does not use mouth-to-mouth breathing and is meant to be utilized by the public at large,” said body performance and injury expert &lt;a href="https://ramihashish.com/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Rami Hashish" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://ramihashish.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Rami Hashish&lt;/a&gt;. “Outside of the hospital, hands-only CPR has been found to be more effective in preserving life than conventional CPR. Reasons as to why this may be included poor quality of, and time loss during, mouth-to-mouth ventilation by the nonmedically trained public.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health experts who spoke to HuffPost emphasized how easy hands-only CPR is to learn and pointed to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4ACYp75mjU" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="short videos that demonstrate" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4ACYp75mjU" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;short videos that demonstrate&lt;/a&gt; how to do these chest compressions. While medical professionals might be well versed in combining chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth (along with other tools at their disposal), the general public tends to feel less comfortable with traditional CPR and thus less inclined to act swiftly in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve found that with hands-only CPR, people feel much more empowered to take action and do something,” Phillips noted. “Take those moments to learn. Almost 90% of cardiac arrests occur in the home or workplace, so take a few minutes to learn this skill because the person who might need it could be your family member or co-worker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Should You Do In The Event Of Cardiac Arrest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are experiencing a cardiac arrest, try to get to a place where you are not alone, or signal to someone you are in distress before you are incapacitated,” Bozinovski said, noting that it sometimes happens too fast for you to dial 911, so asking someone nearby is best. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you suspect someone else is experiencing cardiac arrest, take prompt action. Check for signs of consciousness, a pulse or breathing. Ask another bystander to call 911 or make the call yourself if no one else is around. Then begin hands-only CPR. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Put your hands at the center of the chest and push hard and fast until help arrives,” Sasson said. “Try to push at a rate of 100 to 120 beats per minute ― the tune of ‘Stayin’ Alive’ or ‘Hips Don’t Lie.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important step is checking for an available AED, which can reset the heart’s natural rhythm. AEDs are typically available at workplaces, schools and sporting venues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doing CPR immediately until such time that the defibrillator can be brought to the person in distress is important at limiting the time of no blood supply to the brain and other organs,” Bozinovski said. “Have a third person bring the AED and follow the instructions. These devices are made to provide guidance [on] how to place the paddles, will read the rhythm and provide shock if indicated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggested watching a video or taking a course to learn more about using an AED as well. Still, Sasson emphasized that these devices are designed to be used by those without prior experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people are very fearful. ‘What if i do it wrong? What if I shock someone who shouldn’t be shocked?’” she said. “But it’s built to determine if the person needs a shock. You cannot hurt somebody with an AED.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the person’s pulse will be restored and medical professionals can transfer them to the hospital, as was the case with Hamlin. Although the public will likely have to wait for more updates on the NFL player’s condition, there are steps you can take to make your family and community safer and more prepared for cardiac emergencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

It helps our bodies build and repair muscle, it regulates our blood sugar and keeps us full, and it helps us grow healthy hair and nails. And while most Americans meet their &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a64591955/how-much-protein-do-i-need-to-build-muscle/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein needs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein needs&lt;/a&gt;, some groups have to work harder to get enough, per the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/are-you-getting-too-much-protein" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic Health System;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic Health System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you turn 40, you start to lose muscle mass and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a64770322/protein-helps-muscle-loss-adults-type-2-diabetes-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:need more protein to stay strong;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;need more protein to stay strong&lt;/a&gt; and healthy, per the Mayo Clinic. Likewise, if you exercise regularly, you need more protein to meet your body’s needs. Even if you don’t fall into one of these categories, you should take steps to ensure you’re packing enough protein. &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a64554839/signs-not-enough-protein/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Protein deficiency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Protein deficiency&lt;/a&gt; can make you feel grumpy, sluggish, and hungry all the time—impacting everything from your weight to your mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a63749873/guide-to-eating-protein/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:getting enough protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;getting enough protein&lt;/a&gt; is easier said than done. &lt;a href="https://kitchencoachrd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sarah Mirkin, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sarah Mirkin, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fill-Your-Plate-Lose-Weight/dp/1950099008" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fill Your Plate, Lose The Weight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fill Your Plate, Lose The Weight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, recommends getting at least 20 grams at each meal. Your body can only process 20 to 30 grams at once, she explains, so that’s enough to keep you full and give you energy without going overboard. The thing is, &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/747997/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one egg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one egg&lt;/a&gt; contains just 3.68 grams of protein and a &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/749420/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:slice of bacon;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;slice of bacon&lt;/a&gt; offers just 2.58 grams, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). So even if you think your &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a64900270/high-protein-ingredients-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:meals are protein-packed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;meals are protein-packed&lt;/a&gt;, you may not be getting enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing the signs of protein deficiency can help you recognize when you’re not meeting your body’s needs. Here are the red flags that you need more protein on your plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Missed fitness goals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re working out but not seeing results, your post-workout meals may be to blame. That’s because when you lift weights, your muscle fibers break down. And to help your body repair your muscles and make them stronger than before, you need a post-workout serving of protein. “If you neglect to refuel with protein after your workouts, then you’ve only broken the muscle down, which results in muscle loss,” says Mirkin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Drs Producoes - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Constant sugar cravings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constantly craving sugar and carbs? When you eat a meal that lacks enough protein, you’re more likely to feel unsatisfied and reach for sugary, fatty foods. “Protein balances things out, stops cravings, and keeps us full longer,” says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/nataliejillfit/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Natalie Jill;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Natalie Jill&lt;/a&gt;, the lead trainer for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/163565338X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.g.65480366%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fit After 40;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fit After 40&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Carbohydrates take less time to digest than protein and fat, meaning you’ll feel hungry faster if you load up on carbs instead of balancing out your meals. “If you start your day with just milk and cereal, your blood sugars will spike and then crash,” explains Mirkin. “This will cause you to reach for more carbohydrates to lift you up again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Daniel de la Hoz - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Relentless fatigue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you feel tired all the time, or you’re struggling to concentrate, low protein may be to blame. “If you’re skimping on protein, you may feel brain fog,” says Mirkin. “Protein makes you feel more awake and alert, while carbohydrates can make you feel sleepy.” &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65466288/surprising-iron-deficiency-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Iron deficiency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Iron deficiency&lt;/a&gt;, also known as anemia, can also cause extreme fatigue. Some &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g65428655/iron-rich-foods-vegetarian/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:foods high in iron;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;foods high in iron&lt;/a&gt; also happen to be high in protein, so you can cover both bases by eating foods like beans, quinoa, ground beef, and chicken liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;PixelsEffect - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hair loss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thinner ponytail could be your body’s way of crying out for help. “&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/beauty/hair/a62357247/hair-shedding-vs-hair-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hair loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Hair loss&lt;/a&gt; is very common from low-calorie and low-protein diets,” says Mirkin. “Essential amino acids are necessary for healthy hair, skin, and nails.” So if your hair starts thinning or falling out, make sure you’re getting enough protein. And if you are, talk to your doctor—hair loss is also associated with a range of other health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;JGI - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fat that won’t budge&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re losing weight, but your clothes are still tight, you may be dropping muscle instead of fat. This is especially true if you’re not getting enough post-workout protein, or if you’re over 40—the age when many people begin losing muscle mass. “When our hormones start to change, eating protein becomes even more essential, because this is the time when our body starts losing lean mass,” says Jill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Kseniya Ovchinnikova - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mood swings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re feeling grumpier than usual, you may not be imagining it. Protein can boost your mood by providing the amino acids needed to produce feel-good neurotransmitters, like serotonin and dopamine. “Without these essential amino acids, you are likely to experience &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a37271432/depression-myths/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:depression;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, mood swings, and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a40904213/myths-about-anxiety/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anxiety;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;,” says Mirkin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Galina Zhigalova - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Swelling or bloating&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65450386/bloating-signs-serious-health-condition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:constantly feel bloated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;constantly feel bloated&lt;/a&gt;—even while avoiding bloat-inducing beverages and foods—you may be low on protein. “Protein is necessary to maintain an adequate balance of fluid in and outside of the cells of your body,” says Mirkin. And remember, bloating doesn’t always happen in your belly. You can also experience swelling in your legs and ankles due to lack of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Igor Suka - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Weakened immune system&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking more sick days than usual? A low-protein diet may be to blame, Mirkin says.

It was unexpected, but she and her husband were excited. “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh!’” Kailey recalls. “‘This will be something I’m not used to — having two under 2!’”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A blockage was preventing him from passing urine, which is a serious problem because after midpregnancy, amniotic fluid is made primarily from fetal urine. His kidneys and bladder were severely affected, and even in the best-case scenario, Kailey’s doctor told her the baby would face at least three years of dialysis, followed by a kidney transplant and constant medical challenges. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgagmu800170id0rxw6iem8@published" data-word-count="91"&gt;We got this news before &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/tags/life-after-roe/"&gt;the end of &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. At that time in West Virginia, &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/tags/abortion/"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; was legal up to 20 weeks, and I was a couple of days past that, so I knew I couldn’t terminate the pregnancy in my state. But my doctor &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/adriana-smith-pregnancy-brain-dead-georgia-abortion-law.html"&gt;didn’t even bring up abortion&lt;/a&gt; as a possibility. Instead, he told me the only way to give my baby a chance to live was to travel to Cincinnati, about three and a half hours from my home, for specialized procedures and surgery. I didn’t question it.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgagmu800190id0f79xpsrl@published" data-word-count="61"&gt;I went to Cincinnati with my sister and my youngest daughter. I remember going into it thinking, &lt;em&gt;I just have to get through this. I have to get through these procedures, and Clay’s going to be fine. &lt;/em&gt;Deep inside, I knew Clay wasn’t going to be fine, but I had hope because that’s what my doctor had led me to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgaiz1l001l3b78jr183gax@published" data-word-count="149"&gt;The first day there I had an MRI, an ultrasound, and meetings with the doctors. After the tests, I met with a team of seven maternal-fetal medicine specialists. Each of them had a slightly different perspective, but they all basically said that my case was severe and that I should go through with the procedures and the surgery. Some even said, “We’ve seen miracles!”&lt;br&gt;But I’ll never forget one doctor, who I thought was the most real. He bluntly told me, “This is not going to be a healthy baby. This is not going to be an easy road. This is not something a baby should go through.” He said if I were his daughter, he would suggest termination. But because he was so outnumbered, and because of how much hope I had and how much I wanted the baby, I didn’t hear him. I was lost in a fog.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgagmu8001b0id0olw7lfyz@published" data-word-count="129"&gt;I underwent a test that was kind of like amniocentesis. I was awake and could view what was happening on an ultrasound screen. The doctor used one needle to drain one of the baby’s kidneys to see if he was continuously making urine — that is, if his kidneys were still somewhat working. Then, with a second needle, they inserted synthetic fluid to see if he was able to move around and if he was swallowing it — or kind of breathing it in — like a healthy baby would with amniotic fluid. That would show his kidneys were still doing something, that there was still a little bit of hope. We discovered that while he was able to swallow the fluid, he wasn’t able to pee it out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgajxa9001z3b78eqli8q0k@published" data-word-count="175"&gt;A week later, I returned to Cincinnati for more planned tests. The hospital visits and procedures were fully covered by insurance. We had to pay out of pocket for travel expenses, which was a lot — just the hotel and car rental for one visit to Cincinnati was around $900 — but my insurance reimbursed us eventually.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I brought my husband and our two youngest kids. This time, the procedure was even more intense. They used three needles. The first two were to drain his second kidney — they wanted to see if that kidney was still working at all — and to put more synthetic fluid in. The last needle was to drain his bladder, which was completely full. With the first procedure, he had actually swallowed all the synthetic fluid they put in, so by the time I went back, there was no fluid left around him again. They had to put more in so he could move and so they could see if his kidneys might still be able to make urine.&lt;/p&gt;

The baby’s umbilical cord was in the way, and he kept moving, so the doctor had a really difficult time getting the needle where it needed to go. I remember just lying there, watching the ultrasound screen, seeing them trying to avoid his cord and him squirming around. It felt like the needle was in there for at least seven minutes — way longer than the others. The whole time, I was trying to stay still, but it was painful. My placenta was anterior — in the front — so some of the needles had to go right through it.&lt;/p&gt;

I walked to the bathroom silently to avoid waking up my kids, but my husband heard me and got up. He slipped on the blood on the floor — that’s how much there was.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgalcf1002k3b78g80dhf9y@published" data-word-count="66"&gt;It turned out the last needle had made a small tear in the baby’s amniotic sac, and because of that tear, all the synthetic fluid they had put in came out, along with gushes of blood. I wasn’t about to wake up my children in this crime scene and traumatize them, so I drove myself to the emergency room. That was hard, but I made it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgalcf1002l3b78gf8ttlmr@published" data-word-count="39"&gt;At the hospital, they admitted me, monitored me, did ultrasounds, saw where the tear was, and basically told me there were no more options. They told me I was no longer eligible for the surgery to save the baby.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgalcf1002m3b78nlfbcyi3@published" data-word-count="109"&gt;The next morning, the main MFM specialist who had been treating me came to the hospital and sat down with me. He said, “I became a maternal-fetal medicine doctor because I love babies. I want to save babies. I want to do everything and learn everything I can to help babies. But in this situation, termination would be equivalent to putting down an animal out of kindness.” He said he doesn’t agree with abortion, he’s pro-life, but in this situation there should be no other option. And then he said, “But unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/emergency-abortions-emtala-supreme-court-case.html"&gt;due to the laws&lt;/a&gt;, you just have to go home and wait for his heart to stop.”&lt;/p&gt;

My midwife, who was part of my OB/GYN’s practice, saw just how much pain I was in and how horrible this was for me. She suggested I look into termination. At this point, I was already more than 26 weeks pregnant, so my only viable option was to seek care out of state. She recommended a clinic in Washington, D.C., because it provided &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/dr-shelley-sella-on-providing-third-trimester-abortions.html"&gt;later abortion care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn’t want my son to be born to suffer. I also knew that watching my baby suffocate until he died was not something I personally could go through.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgamgh8003j3b781qqzewbd@published" data-word-count="42"&gt;I was in tears on the phone. The first available appointment was two weeks away. Those two weeks were even harder than the previous three. I was just sitting there thinking, &lt;em&gt;This is the last time I’m going to feel him kick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgantsb003w3b78qwzdx71o@published" data-word-count="118"&gt;About four days before my appointment in D.C., I was putting up Halloween decorations and I felt a huge gush of blood. Immediately, I thought, &lt;em&gt;Oh, this is it. This nightmare might be over and I might not have to go to D.C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;I called my doctor and he said that since the bleeding was intermittent, I should wait until the morning to come in for an ultrasound. Then, at the ultrasound, he said, “He still has a heartbeat. We don’t see you bleeding consistently enough to admit you, so just go home and keep us updated.” The next day, the problem persisted. So I called again, went in for an ultrasound, and was admitted to the nearest hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdganva200433b78uv2y0bpk@published" data-word-count="101"&gt;The maternal-fetal medicine specialist assigned to me knew what I was planning to do — to go to D.C. for an abortion — and he treated me horribly. He wanted to treat the baby with magnesium and steroids to “help his lungs and his brain develop” even though there was no chance he’d survive. He kept saying, “If this was a healthy baby, you would be doing everything you could to fight for him.” And I was like, “You’re right. But that’s not the case!” He and the nurse kept questioning me, saying, “Why don’t you want to fight for him?”&lt;/p&gt;

Then he left the room. My mind was just blown.&lt;/p&gt;

I have never experienced pain like that before. It came on so fast — very sharp pains on the right lower side of my abdomen. I was screaming, “I need something!” They gave me Stadol, which is an opioid. They said that was the only pain medication they could give a pregnant person. It knocked me out. I was still awake, but I was gone. My midwife kept saying how sorry she was, that this shouldn’t be happening, and that she wished she could make the doctors care about my life more, but her hands were tied. Other than her, it seemed like nobody else was on my side.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgaogoy004o3b78fy8n20zw@published" data-word-count="52"&gt;Then my regular OB/GYN came in to see me. I had been with his office for my previous pregnancies as well, and he actually delivered my youngest daughter. I asked him, “Why can’t I just be induced and hold the baby until he passes? He has a zero percent chance to live.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgaogoz004p3b78vvb4b1l9@published" data-word-count="72"&gt;And my OB/GYN said, “You’re requesting that I perform an abortion, and my morals and my beliefs do not align with that. I think you should seek treatment elsewhere.” And he walked out. I had been his patient for so long. When he did that, I started to cry. I thought, &lt;em&gt;Is this real life? Do other people go through this? Is this how they treat people when their life is on the line?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgaogoz004q3b78wzmgedob@published" data-word-count="49"&gt;I was also still out of my mind from the painkiller. It truly felt like they were trying to shut me up just because I was asking to be induced. And through all of this, I was alone — my husband was at home taking care of our kids.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgaoyrk00543b78asahi2ux@published" data-word-count="70"&gt;I asked for the papers to sign myself out against medical advice, and the nurses rushed in and said, “You could bleed out at any time. You could hemorrhage and die.” I responded, “If it seems like that could happen at any minute, I should be treated right away. Or else I’m going to advocate for myself and go to the place where they are going to give me care.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgap5q6005b3b78i3yalath@published" data-word-count="16"&gt;I didn’t want to wait to possibly hemorrhage and bleed out, so I signed myself out.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgaps35005p3b78q4qqiolv@published" data-word-count="57"&gt;The drive to D.C. took about six hours. My husband drove, and I wondered if I would hemorrhage in the car. We kept having to stop and pull over because of the blood gushing and the pain coming and going. I was wearing a pad, but it really wasn’t enough. Looking back, I definitely should’ve used a diaper.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgapz5y005w3b78fp1hftzv@published" data-word-count="73"&gt;Thankfully, we made it. The procedure in D.C. cost $8,800, and we had to put down a $200 deposit, bringing the total to $9,000. We also had to rent a car, but thankfully &lt;a href="https://brigidalliance.org/"&gt;the Brigid Alliance&lt;/a&gt; — a nonprofit that &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/12/new-yorkers-can-help-you-get-an-abortion.html"&gt;supports people traveling for abortion care&lt;/a&gt; — covered the car rental, hotel stay, and gas. They were truly lifesavers — without them, I honestly don’t know how we would’ve made it to D.C.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgaqo6o006a3b78o4v388mf@published" data-word-count="93"&gt;My memory of the clinic is somewhat blurry because it was such a traumatic experience. On the day I arrived, the doctors and nurses explained everything that was going to happen and how it would happen. I was not very educated about abortion. They told me that when you’re that far along, usually they can’t get the fetus out in one piece. That scenario had never crossed my mind. I had just assumed I was going to have the baby and be able to hold him after, and I couldn’t imagine the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgaqsaq006h3b78akxu2wsw@published" data-word-count="53"&gt;The doctor came in and began asking me questions about my previous pregnancies and my labors, and I shared that my first three labors were really fast. I believe that because the doctor knew that, the team was able to perform the procedure in a way that allowed me to hold my baby.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgarcw0006u3b78ubiewobd@published" data-word-count="120"&gt;Someone handed him to me — he was wrapped up in a blanket. And I just remember his face. It was so perfect that it was hard to believe he had so many problems. But then, I remember a nurse said, “We suggest that you not unwrap his blanket because of how small his chest is, compared to how big his belly is.” That was because of all the abnormalities. I had wanted to hold him and see him so badly, but that kind of ruined it. I’d had three healthy, chubby babies, so holding a very, very small baby — he measured much less than 27 weeks — I thought, &lt;em&gt;I should not be seeing my child like this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgarhbz00713b78cvd5yj82@published" data-word-count="14"&gt;I handed Clay back. For a long time, I regretted not holding him longer.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgas6r7007e3b78q62g13z0@published" data-word-count="62"&gt;Almost exactly two years later, in September 2023 when I was 31 years old, we took a vacation to the beach. I had recently sold my kids’ cribs, the safety table, everything we had bought for Clay. I was like, “I’ll never be pregnant again. I’m never having another baby. This is it.” But then, on vacation, I took a pregnancy test.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgas85f007l3b788leo9n2d@published" data-word-count="49"&gt;It was bittersweet because I was terrified to be pregnant in West Virginia again, especially after the fall of &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt;. But a small piece of me was still excited thinking that maybe I’d get to have another healthy pregnancy. That Clay wasn’t the end of my story with pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgasc6v007r3b782z467787@published" data-word-count="43"&gt;Now, my husband, he would have a football team if he could. He was so excited. I’m sure deep down it was scary for him, but he felt like he needed to be strong for me. His excitement made it a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgat0nn00843b78w6cetvjr@published" data-word-count="61"&gt;I found a different OB/GYN, and he was very sensitive, really great to me, knowing my past. From the beginning, he took time to listen to my entire story and made it clear he would do whatever it took to make me feel safe and supported. He took all my concerns seriously and never once made me feel like a burden.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgat4a0008h3b78kj9ua5ok@published" data-word-count="46"&gt;From a health perspective, this pregnancy was easy. With my first three and with Clay, I had hyperemesis gravidarum, where you’re very sick, throwing up all the time. With this pregnancy, I still got sick, but it was nowhere near as extreme as in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgat4a0008i3b783foewaq3@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;Yet no matter how easy it was, it didn’t take away from the fact that I felt like I couldn’t breathe until my 20-week ultrasound. The sonographer was so kind and took her time, reassuring me that the baby looked 100 percent healthy — especially pointing out how good his kidneys looked and that there was no sign of LUTO or any other abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgatrf0008v3b78vppi7cez@published" data-word-count="108"&gt;At 39 weeks, my husband and I went in so I could have a scheduled induction — that was my choice. It helped me feel more in control. They gave me an epidural and the medicine to induce me and then they told me to try to take a nap because nothing was supposed to happen for a few hours. But I knew I was going to progress fast. Within an hour, I was pushing. I hit the button to call them back, pushed three times, and the baby was out. The moment I heard him cry, I finally felt like I could breathe. We named him Chris.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgatt1400923b78xqs9v8v1@published" data-word-count="81"&gt;As soon as the baby was born, they handed him to me right away for skin-to-skin. It was such a relief. But something in me also just kept thinking, &lt;em&gt;This is how I wish it could have been with Clay.&lt;/em&gt; It just sucks when life deals you that card. To have gone through all that and then be able to have a normal, healthy pregnancy where everything is easy and smooth, you just think, &lt;em&gt;Why didn’t I get that with him?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgauok5009p3b78lhfeec3s@published" data-word-count="69"&gt;Looking back, I feel like somebody should have sat down with me at my 20-week ultrasound and said, “Yes, you can go to Cincinnati and do all this. But also, you could go another way — you could have an abortion — and that would also be a selfless decision.” I just feel that both options should have been put on the table. I was really naïve back then.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgauqi8009w3b78de19wj0b@published" data-word-count="56"&gt;Eventually, I found out the needles used in my procedures in Cincinnati had damaged my placenta. When I was 26 weeks and started bleeding, it was because I was having a slow placental abruption. Had I not checked myself out of that hospital and advocated for myself, I might have lost my life or my fertility.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgauqi8009x3b78pb3gpia8@published" data-word-count="28"&gt;I firmly believe that if I hadn’t gone to D.C. for that procedure, I wouldn’t have Chris — I wouldn’t have the healthy, happy 1-year-old I have now.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdgavcxf00aa3b78ft08gczv@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;He has been my easiest baby so far. He’s the sweetest baby. He’s so happy. And this may be a little woo-woo, but it feels like there’s a piece of Clay still in him. I don’t know if Clay sent him to me, but I do feel like there’s some type of bond there. Sometimes, when we’re lying down, Chris will literally just hold my face and look at me. He’s always done that from the beginning. Having him healed a part of my soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diving into a public pool this summer? You might be plunging into a petri dish. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While chlorine is the go-to germ killer, it doesn’t work instantly. Some nasty germs can survive in treated water for minutes or even days, turning a refreshing swim into a risky dip.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the threat is growing. Outbreaks of waterborne illnesses tied to pools and other recreational venues are on the rise — especially those caused by a resilient parasite that’s waiting to crash your summer plans with a case of watery diarrhea. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Waterborne illnesses are most prevalent during the summer months.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Tropical studio – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Not-so-crystal-clear&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That sparkling blue water isn’t always as clean as it looks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time someone jumps in, they bring more than just sunscreen and swimsuits, leaving behind germs, grime and bodily fluids that can make others sick.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, the average swimmer introduces:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 million microbes in a single drop of spit&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;140 billion microbes from feces&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Up to two cans’ worth of sweat&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A full cup of urine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All of those substances mix with chlorine to form chloramines, a chemical byproduct that can irritate your eyes and lungs and give off that strong “pool smell” most people wrongly associate with cleanliness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Experts say a strong smell of chlorine indicates a high level of urine in pool water.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Angkana – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“​​It is a common myth that a strong chlorine smell is a good sign of a clean pool,” Lisa Cuchara, an immunologist and infectious disease specialist, wrote in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/poop-pee-perspiration-chlorine-how-germy-is-swimming-pool-really/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In fact, it may actually be a red flag that means the opposite — that the water is contaminated and should perhaps be avoided,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s really lurking in the water&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most pool-related illnesses happen when swimmers swallow contaminated water or come into contact with it through their skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If its levels are properly maintained, chlorine can kill many germs, like E. coli, in under a minute. Some germs, however, are far more stubborn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take hepatitis A. It can survive in a chlorinated pool for about 16 minutes. The virus usually gets in the water through fecal contamination, like if if someone uses the bathroom and doesn’t wash their hands before hopping back in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant for swimming pools. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Evgeniya Sheydt – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once infected, the virus can inflame the liver and disrupt its ability to function properly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then there’s giardia, a parasite that often enters pools when people have accidents in the water or don’t rinse off properly. It can take 45 minutes or longer to kill with chlorine, and just a small sip of contaminated water can trigger diarrhea, stomach pain, gas and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Super pooper parasite&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the worst offender is cryptosporidium, a microscopic germ with a tough outer shell that enables it survive in chlorine-treated water for up to 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like giardia, cryptosporidium commonly spreads when someone with diarrhea contaminates the water and another swimmer swallows it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 2009 and 2017, crypto caused nearly 450 outbreaks across 40 states and Puerto Rico, sickening more than 7,400 people, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Waterborne illnesses can leave swimmers with gut-churning symptoms, including diarrea.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Satjawat – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks jumped 13% each year, with most traced back to people swallowing water from treated pools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Swallowing just a mouthful of water with crypto in it can make otherwise healthy kids and adults sick for weeks with watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, and vomiting,” Michele Hlavsa, chief of CDC’s Healthy Swimming Program, said in &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/media/releases/2018/p0517-swimming-related-diseases.html"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Bacteria, viruses and fungi, oh my! &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other troublemakers — including Shigella, norovirus and adenovirus — can also lurk in chlorinated water and wreck your gut. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bacteria like Legionella and Pseudomonas pose additional risks. Legionella can cause a serious form of pneumonia, while Pseudomonas is known for triggering skin rashes and ear infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even fungi get in on the act. Pool decks, ladders, and locker rooms are breeding grounds for fungal spores. Once established, they’re hard to eliminate and often resistant to regular cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s how infections like athlete’s foot — and other skin irritations — spread so easily in damp, high-traffic areas like your local community pool. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Swimmer’s ear is a bacterial infection caused by water that stays in the outer ear canal for a long period of time. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Satjawat – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;But don’t toss your trunks just yet&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are simple steps you can take to reduce the spread of viruses, bacteria and other germs in swimming pools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CDC recommends staying out of the water if you have diarrhea and waiting at least two weeks after symptoms clear up to take a dip. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Before you dive in, shower for at least a minute to rinse off dirt, sweat and any lingering germs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Parents should take kids on regular bathroom breaks and check diapers every hour — and never change them poolside.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;While in the pool, try not to swallow water. When you’re out, dry your ears well with a towel to help prevent swimmer’s ear.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;And, of course, don’t pee or poop in the pool.  Sounds obvious? Not for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Last year alone, New York City’s parks department had to shut down pools 203 times to clean up after someone defecated, according to data obtained by The Gothamist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s 44 out of 52 public pools closed at least once for a “code brown.” On one day in August, 12 pools were shuttered because of poop in the water. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pee’s no better. In a &lt;a href="https://www.healthypools.org/press-release.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;national survey&lt;/a&gt; released last month, more than half of participants admitted to urinating in the pool as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Acid rain is a term that refers to not just rain but also other forms of precipitation such as snow, hail, sleet, and fog that has a higher acidity than normal. Acid rain is caused by the burning of fossil fuels, especially from vehicles and factories, and has devastating consequences. It destroys entire forests, kills plants and fish in water bodies, harms crops, and has a negative impact on human health. Being exposed to it or even just breathing in the particles can cause eye and skin irritation, fluid in the lungs, and dental erosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Research into what was causing this environmental impact was at its peak during the 1960s through the 1980s. Thanks to efforts by dedicated journalists and scientists, often with considerable pushback from the industries they were accusing of causing these problems, it was proven that acid rain exists, along with the horrible consequences it has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Unlike with &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/scientists-want-to-test-a-solar-umbrella-that-could-help-fight-climate-change/" target="_blank"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;, widespread reform has greatly reduced the dangers of acid rain, especially in Europe and North America. This was achieved through new policies that reduced emissions, as well as the discovery of microbes that could naturally lower the acidity levels of lakes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A handful of policies were created in response to acid rain research. The U.S. Clean Air Act of 1990 focused on reducing emissions overall. The Acid Rain Program enhanced this, putting a limit on the amount of sulfur dioxide emissions from the power sector and reducing nitrogen oxides. Efforts by the Canadian Coalition on Acid Rain helped to &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/tech/apple-cuts-greenhouse-emissions-in-half-as-it-focuses-on-carbon-neutral-goal-by-2030/" target="_blank"&gt;lower emissions&lt;/a&gt; and supported environmental groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement of 1991 was also a key policy. Upon realizing that pollutants can travel across country borders and affect one another, the two countries worked together to put an end to it. The agreement was expanded in 2000 with the Ozone Annex which aimed to lower smog emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There was also the discovery of alkali-producing microbes – which can neutralize acid in bodies of water. These microbes already live naturally in lakes, so it was only necessary to stop adding extra acidity into the lakes, and the microbes would clean the water naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acid rain can return if the protections put in place for our air quality are rolled back. Scientist Gene Likens, one of the researchers who originally proved the existence of acid rain, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/27/acid-rain-trump-epa" target="_blank"&gt;told The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, "I hope we don't go back to the old days ... I care about the health of my children and grandchildren, I want them to have clean air to breathe. I care about clean water and clean and healthy soil, I want them to have that too."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress has been made with renewable energy, and data from the &lt;a href="https://gispub.epa.gov/air/trendsreport/2024/#introduction" target="_blank"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; (EPA), shows a large decline in air pollutants since 1970. This includes a 92% reduction in sulfur dioxide between 1990 and 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/scientists-may-have-found-a-clean-energy-source-hidden-under-the-earth/" target="_blank"&gt;Scientists are also looking into hydrogen as a clean energy source for the future&lt;/a&gt;. These advancements give hope that even if regulations were rolled back, things would not return to how they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

But while the exact reason why you’re having trouble getting and staying hard can be complicated, a new research review suggests there's a simple lifestyle move that can help fight ED: Building muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The scientific analysis, which was published in the journal &lt;em data-node-id="1.1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/smr/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/sxmrev/qeaf033/8208287?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://academic.oup.com/smr/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/sxmrev/qeaf033/8208287?redirectedFrom=fulltext" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sexual Medicine Reviews" data-node-id="1.1.0" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Sexual Medicine Reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, builds on previous research that has found that a gym routine that's good for your muscles and health is also good for lowering your ED risk and keeping your sexual function healthy. It also had some interesting findings on nutrition and erectile dysfunction, giving you more tools to add to your ED-fighting arsenal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You may know this, but it never hurts to repeat it: Erectile dysfunction is defined as the inability to sustain an erection that is firm enough for penetrative intercourse.

And the latest findings add weight to the idea that increasing your muscle gains may help you below the belt, in addition to improving your overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There are a few things going on here:&lt;br data-node-id="11.1"&gt;&lt;br data-node-id="11.2"&gt;• Strength training can help with blood flow. “While higher testosterone levels from strength training may play a minor role, the primary benefits are derived from improved vascular health,” Khera says. Strength training is linked with lower inflammation in the body, better function of the endothelial cells that line the inner surface of blood vessels, and more availability of nitric oxide, which widens blood vessels throughout your body (including in your penis), he explains. All of these elements support better blood flow and blood vessel health, which Khera calls “critical” for erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;• Having more muscle mass also increases insulin sensitivity, which is linked with better erectile function, too, points out &lt;a href="https://urologyaustin.com/doctors/john-sigalos-m-d/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://urologyaustin.com/doctors/john-sigalos-m-d/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Sigalos" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;John Sigalos&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a urologist at Urology Austin. That influences how well your body uses glucose for energy. "As seen in diabetes and other metabolic syndromes, we know that poor regulation of sugar leads to dysfunction of the small blood vessels that affect erections," Sigalos says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;• More muscle strength may mean you're healthier in general. That means you're less likely to have issues associated with ED, including type 2 diabetes or high cholesterol, says &lt;a href="https://www.malereproduction.com/about-cmrm/dr-philip-werthman/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.malereproduction.com/about-cmrm/dr-philip-werthman/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Philip Werthman" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Philip Werthman&lt;/a&gt;, MD, urologist and director of the Center for Male Reproductive Medicine and Vasectomy Reversal in Los Angeles, CA. “Doing more strength training may help you lose fat, build muscle mass, and change your overall hormonal dynamics,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="so-will-lifting-more-take-down-ed" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1m9gjyt emevuu60"&gt;So will lifting more take down ED?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Overall, Khera says it’s not a bad idea to lift more to combat erectile dysfunction, although there's no specific prescription yet for how much and what kind of workouts you should do. “Strength training can be an effective remedy for erectile dysfunction,” he says. Khera’s past research has found that 160 minutes of exercise a week, including strength training, significantly improved erectile function in men. “Notably, those with the most severe erectile dysfunction experienced the greatest improvements through regular exercise,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="nutrients-might-matter-too" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-1m9gjyt emevuu60"&gt;Nutrients Might Matter, Too &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;One more thing to consider: The study also found that L-carnitine, an amino acid found in red meat, poultry, and fish, may help work as a remedy for ED, too. “L-carnitine plays a role in nitric oxide production, as it is a precursor to this crucial molecule,” Khera says. “Nitric oxide is essential for vascular health, including penile blood flow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Werthman has also found that his patients have success with L-carnitine supplements. “We’ve been using L-carnitine for male fertility for decades,” he says. “It’s an antioxidant that protects the sperm and it helps muscle recovery." Werthman points out that he’s studied the impact of L-carnitine on sperm, and found that stronger erections happened, too. “There were a number of men who came back after a couple of months on L-carnitine and said, ‘Hey, my erections got better,’” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you’re experiencing erectile dysfunction, Werthman says it’s important to see a healthcare provider for a full workup. Not only can a health professional help turn things around, they can also check in on what's going on behind the scenes that's contributing to or causing ED. “Erectile dysfunction can be an early warning sign of cardiac dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, or other conditions,” Werthman says. “Make sure you’re OK before just getting a prescription for Viagra.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-cmvt2k ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antioxidants play an important role in fighting off free radicals and reducing your risk of chronic disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We typically associate brightly colored foods with antioxidants, but plenty of brown and white foods also contain them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprising examples of antioxidant-rich foods include peanut butter, olives, oats, coffee and mushrooms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Antioxidants are naturally occurring compounds that play an important role in your overall health by fighting off free radicals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Free radicals are formed in the body as a byproduct of metabolism but also through exposure to air pollution, pesticides and more. These unstable molecules are bad news, since they can damage your cells and DNA. Over time, that damage can lead to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and increase your risk of diseases like cancer and type 2 diabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s where antioxidants come in—they can neutralize those unstable free radicals and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-reduce-skin-cancer-risk-11765954" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prevent the cell damage&lt;/a&gt; they might otherwise cause. While “eat the rainbow” is often a good rule of thumb when it comes to getting antioxidants from food, there are other &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027728/best-budget-friendly-antioxidant-rich-foods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;antioxidant-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; that might not follow the rainbow rule. Here’s why we think these surprising antioxidant-rich foods deserve a spot in your diet.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Peanut butter is well known for being a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/protein-longevity-study-11720799" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;source of plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt; and healthy fats, but it’s also packed with antioxidants. For example, peanut butter is a good source of vitamin E and contains phenolic compounds—both of which stamp out free radicals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When restocking your peanut butter, be sure to reach for one that doesn’t have added oils or salt. Bonus points if you can find a peanut butter that is made with unblanched peanuts (aka skin-on peanuts). Research has found that the peanut skins contain more phenolic acids than other well-known antioxidant-rich foods like blueberries or green tea.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite their nickname as “nature’s candy”, dates are more than just a sweet treat. They might not be as brightly colored as other fruits, but dates are rich in antioxidants just the same. “Dates deliver &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-antioxidant-drinks-11736079" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;powerful antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, including carotenoids, flavonoids and phytosterols. Together, these compounds help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8057501/healthy-foods-help-lower-heart-disease-risk-new-study/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protect against heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease, and even have antimicrobial properties,” says &lt;a href="https://highenergynutrition.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Christina Kilton, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we often hear about all the health benefits associated with olive oil, we may overlook the olives themselves. Beyond being a popular addition to cheese boards, olives are rich in an array of essential vitamins and minerals. For example, olives contain vitamin E and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/tea-aging-study-11731249" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant compounds like quercetin&lt;/a&gt; and hydroxytyrosol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The only drawback to snacking on olives is that they are high in sodium, so those who need to monitor their sodium intake or have high blood pressure should watch their portion size or give them a quick rinse under water.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potatoes are another food that many people might assume isn’t as healthy as other vibrant-colored veggies. “Potatoes are a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/50623/7-of-the-healthiest-foods-you-should-be-eating-but-arent/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient-dense whole food&lt;/a&gt; that’s high in antioxidants.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While most people are familiar with the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fiber-foods-to-help-lower-cholesterol-11770161" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol-lowering benefits&lt;/a&gt; of oats, they are also a surprising source of antioxidants. The primary antioxidants found in oats include polyphenols, chlorophyll and flavonoids, as well as one that is specific to oats called avenanthramides—all of which work together to combat free radicals and inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And that’s not all: the beta-glucan in oats does more than help lower cholesterol—it encourages the good bacteria in your gut to produce &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7960120/whole-grains-cereal-fiber-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;inflammation-fighting short-chain fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Next time you make a bowl of oats, top it with some fruit and nuts to boost the antioxidants even more.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Almost 75% of U.S. adults drink at least one cup of coffee every single day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That morning cup of joe provides more than just a buzz—coffee is surprisingly rich in antioxidants. Research has found that coffee beans contain over 100 different polyphenols, or antioxidant compounds, including phenolic acids and flavonoids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So what’s the best way to brew your coffee for optimal antioxidants? One study found that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/41595/9-rules-for-how-to-make-a-perfect-cup-of-coffee/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;medium roast, organic coffee beans&lt;/a&gt; brewed for three minutes had the highest levels of antioxidants when compared to other brewing methods.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another veggie surprisingly high in antioxidants is mushrooms. “Baby bella mushrooms are easy to find in most grocery stores and pack a punch when it comes to antioxidants—especially ergothioneine and glutathione,” says &lt;a href="https://www.firstlinenutritionllc.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Candice Knauer, M.S., RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition, the antioxidants in mushrooms may help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/early-adulthood-inflammation-may-influence-cognition-in-midlife-8676000" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;prevent inflammation in the brain&lt;/a&gt;. One study found that cognitive decline was significantly delayed in people who consumed polyphenol-rich foods like mushrooms, cocoa and red wine regularly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While incorporating more vibrantly hued fruits and vegetables into your diet is one way to increase your antioxidant intake, those aren’t the only foods that offer these good-for-you compounds. In fact, you might be surprised to learn that plenty of brown and white foods like dates, potatoes, mushrooms and peanut butter are packed with them. So if you’re looking to score more antioxidants in your diet, don’t overlook these foods!&lt;br&gt;

A new study in human cells and mice has found the first experimental evidence that the compound can increase longevity and fight signs of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a psychedelic, psilocybin is usually investigated for its potential as a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-finally-figured-out-how-magic-mushrooms-might-relieve-depression"&gt;treatment for depression&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety, and other &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/psilocybin-put-rat-brains-back-together-after-mild-head-trauma"&gt;neurological disorders&lt;/a&gt;. But there hasn't been a whole lot of direct research into what effects it might have on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/older-people-who-use-psychedelics-show-fascinating-brain-functions"&gt;biological aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new study, scientists at Emory University and Baylor College of Medicine in the US tested it on cultures of human cells and on live mice. Both cases showed drastic extensions of lifespan – treated cells lived more than 50 percent longer than untreated ones, while treated mice were much more likely to survive the whole period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/psychedelic-drugs-have-huge-therapeutic-potential-an-expert-explains-why?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Psychedelic Drugs Have Huge Therapeutic Potential.

The cells were then monitored until they reached &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence"&gt;senescence&lt;/a&gt;, a state where they essentially 'run out' of cell divisions and go dormant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At concentrations of 100 micromoles, treated lung cells took 57 percent longer to reach senescence, compared to untreated ones. Treated skin cells showed a 51 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168870" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168870" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screen-Shot-2025-07-23-at-4.49.00-pm-642x389.png" alt="First Experimental Evidence Suggests Psilocybin Extends Lifespan in Human Cells And Mice" class="wp-image-168870 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screen-Shot-2025-07-23-at-4.49.00-pm-642x389.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screen-Shot-2025-07-23-at-4.49.00-pm-685x415.png 685w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screen-Shot-2025-07-23-at-4.49.00-pm-768x465.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screen-Shot-2025-07-23-at-4.49.00-pm-600x363.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screen-Shot-2025-07-23-at-4.49.00-pm.png 958w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168870" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Percentage of surviving mice over the 10-month study period.

And deaths from alcohol-related hepatitis, a disease resulting in severe liver inflammation, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39739407/" target="_blank"&gt;nearly tripled among women&lt;/a&gt; over the same time period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6dcc85" class="body-graf"&gt;A new study, &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S154235652500610X" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the medical journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, similarly points to an elevated risk of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/women-us-are-drinking-death-research-finds-rcna96848" target="_blank"&gt;alcohol-related liver disease&lt;/a&gt; among women. The condition encompasses various types of liver damage due to excessive alcohol consumption. It spans early-stage inflammation to severe scarring, known as cirrhosis, which can lead to liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-825a7b" class="body-graf"&gt;Women are more susceptible than men to alcohol-related liver disease for several reasons. For one, their bodies tend to have less water weight and a higher percentage of body fat. That combination increases the concentration of alcohol in their blood, which the liver then has to process. Compared with men, women also naturally have lower levels of an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase, which helps the body metabolize alcohol. That again leads to higher blood alcohol concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-22a7a4" class="body-graf"&gt;Those physiological differences, combined with the sharp increase in alcohol use and binge drinking, have made women particularly vulnerable to alcohol-related illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c7982b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Historically, there’s been differences in prevalence rates [of alcohol use] between men and women. And essentially, that gap has now closed and the ratio between men and women’s drinking is almost at 1 to 1,” said Sherry McKee, director of the Yale SCORE Program on Sex Differences in Alcohol Use Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-91615b" class="body-graf"&gt;Changes in women’s lifestyles have created increasing opportunities to consume alcohol, McKee said. Today’s young adults drink less compared with previous generations, but there are now more women in college than men — and college is generally associated with increased alcohol consumption, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d72cef" class="body-graf"&gt;“You pair that with the fact that women are delaying childbirth, delaying marriage — it just gives more space for women to continue drinking in the post-college years,” McKee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2b205" class="body-graf"&gt;Women’s heavy alcohol consumption is most common in midlife, said Katherine Keyes, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. Some researchers attribute the trend to stress or office drinking culture, but Keyes said the main reason women are drinking more is for fun. She noted that wine and spirits are often marketed to women as luxury goods or methods of relaxation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f1b648" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts said more awareness of the health risks of drinking could help encourage women to scale back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52632d" class="body-graf"&gt;“It isn’t the case that every single person who drinks heavily will get liver disease from it. But we do know that a proportion of those folks do — about 25 to 30%,” said Dr. Jessica Mellinger, a senior staff physician at Henry Ford Health, a Michigan-based health system. The more a person drinks, she added, the greater likelihood they have of getting alcohol-related liver disease of any stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-15cc54" class="body-graf"&gt;The study published Wednesday found that heavy drinkers are developing alcohol-related liver disease at more than double the rate compared with 20 years ago. The researchers suspect that’s because people vulnerable to liver disease — including women and those with obesity or diabetes — are drinking more compared with decades past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-04089e" class="body-graf"&gt;“The modern American drinker looks different than it did 20 years ago,” said Dr. Brian Lee, the study’s lead author and a hepatologist at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-035b3b" class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers used data from a national, government-led survey to measure drinking habits and liver health in the U.S. They characterized heavy drinkers as men who consumed at least 30 grams of alcohol per day — roughly two standard drinks — and women who consumed at least 20 grams per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2dfaba" class="body-graf"&gt;Among heavy drinkers, the risk of significant liver damage more than doubled over a 22-year period, from nearly 2% in 1999-2004 to more than 4% in 2013-20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-382a41" class="body-graf"&gt;The rate of metabolic syndrome — conditions like obesity or high blood pressure that increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke — among heavy drinkers also increased during that time, from 26% to nearly 38%. Both obesity and Type 2 diabetes can cause fat to build up in the liver, thereby elevating the risk of liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dbdc5e" class="body-graf"&gt;“It could be the situation of a perfect storm.

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Chronic venous insufficiency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, CVI is a condition where the veins in the legs struggle to pump blood back to the heart, “resulting in reverse flow which causes inflammation, typically around the ankles,” Whiteley explains. “The trouble is that CVI is a catch-all term which basically means that the valves aren’t working. This could be in the superficial veins near the skin surface or in the deep veins which run through your muscles.” Varicose veins may be a symptom of CVI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors include age, prolonged inactivity and family history. CVI may also occur in people who have previously had deep vein thrombosis (DVT – see more on this condition below) and key symptoms include swollen, discoloured, achy, tired or tingly legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have swollen ankles and you think you could have CVI, it’s really important to get a scan because the treatments and outcomes are phenomenally different depending on whether you have CVI in the deep or superficial veins,” Whiteley explains. “It becomes a very different problem if the deep veins are involved, but fortunately – unless you’ve had DVT in the past – it’s usually superficial and can almost always be properly treated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Blood clots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When blood clots form in your veins, the condition is called “thrombosis”. There are three key reasons why this happens, known as Virchow’s triad, Whiteley explains, and these are “changes in the blood, changes in the blood flow, and changes in the blood wall”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors that “change your blood” include &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/12/30/every-cigarette-smoked-20-minutes-life-ucl-study-tobacco-uk/"&gt;smoking cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; and taking the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/sex/contraceptive-pill-myths/"&gt;contraceptive pill&lt;/a&gt;, Whiteley says. The nicotine in cigarettes causes blood vessels to constrict, whilst also damaging the inner lining of veins and causing inflammation. Meanwhile, in the pill, oestrogen is known to make blood more “sticky”, therefore increasing the risk of clotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damage to the vessel wall can occur because of “inflammation, tumours, radiation, injury, or surgery”, whilst abnormal blood flow may occur when “you sit down or don’t move for long periods of time,” Whiteley explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a blood clot forms below the knee or in a superficial vein (superficial thrombophlebitis), it’s not generally considered as dangerous and it may resolve itself, Whiteley says. However, it becomes more concerning if the clot forms in a vein behind the knee or, worse, between your knee and groin or pelvis. This is called a DVT…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;…Which is a serious condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein. “If a clot forms between your knee and groin, or in your pelvis, there’s a chance it travels to the heart, is pumped to the lungs and causes a pulmonary embolism [PE],” Whiteley explains. A PE can lead to serious complications including respiratory distress and cardiovascular issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/dont-let-dvt-destroy-your-holiday/"&gt;Symptoms of DVT&lt;/a&gt; include throbbing pain or swelling in one leg, swollen veins that are hard or sore when you touch them and warm skin around the painful area. You’re more likely to get DVT if you’re over 60, have varicose veins, are overweight or have had the condition before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the long term, DVT can also damage the deep veins. You can end up with a long-term swollen, discoloured leg, often with ulcers, which is called post-thrombotic syndrome,” Whiteley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should ask for an urgent GP appointment if you think you have DVT, or call 999 if you have symptoms such as swelling and breathlessness or chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Venous leg ulcer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venous leg ulcers are open and painful sores which usually develop on the inside of the leg, between the knee and the ankle. You may develop a venous leg ulcer if you’ve previously had DVT, have varicose veins, are older, overweight or have difficulty walking and symptoms include pain, itching and swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DVT can cause leg ulcers in the long term because the blood clots can damage valves in the veins, leading to inflammation which damages the skin,” Whiteley explains, whilst varicose veins also increase inflammation in the leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venous leg ulcers are unlikely to get better on their own and usually require specialist medical treatment to ensure they don’t become infected or lead to tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;

Called the coagulation cascade, this involves up to 20 different proteins known as clotting factors, according to the &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000538.htm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000538.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="U.S. National Library of Medicine" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;U.S. National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. But when you don’t have one or more of these clotting factors, you have a higher chance of excess bleeding. Hemophilia A and B are the result of the lack of certain clotting factors. And some of the symptoms of these conditions may seem a bit odd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Hemophilia A is caused by the lack of blood clotting factor VIII, per the U.S. National Library of Medicine. &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000539.htm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000539.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hemophilia B" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Hemophilia B&lt;/a&gt; happens when the body doesn’t make enough of coagulation factor IX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While both conditions are slightly different, the symptoms are generally the same. (However, they may vary based on how severe your condition is.) Most people with hemophilia are diagnosed at a young age, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hemophilia/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/hemophilia/data-research/index.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC). But it’s possible to have a mild case of hemophilia A or B that goes undiagnosed until later in life, per the U.S. National Library of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="body-tip css-1707dxl emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="4.0"&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/allyson-pishko" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/allyson-pishko" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Allyson Pishko, M.D." data-node-id="4.2" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Allyson Pishko, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a hematologist with the Penn Blood Disorders Center at Penn Medicine; &lt;a href="https://nursing.gwu.edu/asefeh-faraz-covelli" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://nursing.gwu.edu/asefeh-faraz-covelli" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Asefeh Faraz, Ph.D., A.P.R.N." data-node-id="4.4" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Asefeh Faraz, Ph.D., A.P.R.N.&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor at The George Washington University School of Nursing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Hemophilia isn’t a condition that’s well-known to the general population and the exact number of people living with hemophilia isn’t known, per the CDC. What is known is the condition is much more common in genetic males than females, and that hemophilia A is three to four times as common as hemophilia B. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Both types can cause long-term complications like joint issues, and severe cases may be life-threatening, especially if they go untreated. With that in mind, these are some lesser-known symptoms of hemophilia A and B doctors want you to keep in mind.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="excessive-bleeding" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="7.0"&gt;Excessive bleeding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Having hemophilia means that you may end up bleeding for a longer time after an injury than if your blood clotted properly, explains &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/allyson-pishko" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/allyson-pishko" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Allyson Pishko, M.D." data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Allyson Pishko, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a hematologist with the Penn Blood Disorders Center at Penn Medicine. There is some variation here, though, and that can influence when someone is diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“If severe, hemophilia is often diagnosed during infancy,” says &lt;a href="https://nursing.gwu.edu/asefeh-faraz-covelli" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://nursing.gwu.edu/asefeh-faraz-covelli" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Asefeh Faraz, Ph.D., A.P.R.N." data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Asefeh Faraz, Ph.D., A.P.R.N.&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor at The George Washington University School of Nursing. “Otherwise, it’s diagnosed later in life if a patient has excessive bleeding after injury or surgery.” Dr. Pishko also points out that someone with hemophilia may have “excessive bleeding” after their wisdom tooth is removed or they have a tonsillectomy. “Excessive bleeding is more than would be expected with a typical cut or injury, and [is] unable to be stopped using typical first aid,” Faraz says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="10" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;Easy bruising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;People with hemophilia may develop larger bruises after having injuries that are relatively minor, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14083-hemophilia" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14083-hemophilia" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cleveland Clinic" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. This is a sign of bleeding under the skin. “There are not enough clotting factors in the blood” to help slow down the bleeding that can lead to these large, noticeable bruises, Faraz says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="12" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;Heavy periods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While hemophilia is much more common in men than women, females can inherit the condition, Dr. Pishko says. “This diagnosis is sometimes missed in females as they have been told that hemophilia only affects males,” she says. But Dr. Pishko says that women with hemophilia may end up dealing with heavy periods or heavy bleeding with childbirth. “It is important for females to have testing of their blood clotting levels if they have a family history of hemophilia or symptoms,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="14" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;Bleeding after vaccination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s not common for anyone to experience bleeding from the injection site after getting a vaccine, but there is a slightly increased risk of bleeding after getting a shot in people who have hemophilia. People with hemophilia also have higher odds of developing a hematoma, or closed wound where blood collects, after being vaccinated, too, per the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemophilia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373327" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemophilia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373327" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mayo Clinic" data-vars-ga-product-id="e25e45e1-8273-4e95-8a22-c262054636c9" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="15.1" data-href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemophilia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373327" data-product-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemophilia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373327" data-affiliate="false" data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="430b2b2a-37b0-44df-9d0b-63efe3bb057f" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-inlxvj e1aq0z090"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="16" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;Joint pain and swelling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Hemophilia can cause bleeding in the joints, too, Dr. Pishko says. “This presents as sudden pain and swelling in the joint,” she says. “It can occur repeatedly within the same joint.” If left untreated, frequent bleeding in the joints can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8456897/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8456897/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="raise the risk of arthritis" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;raise the risk of arthritis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="18" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;Lower range of motion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Because hemophilia can impact the joints, it can also limit your range of motion. This is more common in females with hemophilia compared to those who don’t have a bleeding disorder, according to the CDC.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="20" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;Nosebleeds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Everyone experiences nosebleeds at some point, but nosebleeds with no known cause can be a sign of hemophilia, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/ear-nose-throat/Pages/Chronic-Nosebleeds-What-To-Do.aspx" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/ear-nose-throat/Pages/Chronic-Nosebleeds-What-To-Do.aspx" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Academy of Pediatrics" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; (AAP). This can happen when a blood vessel in the nose breaks and doesn’t clot easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="22" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;Blood in the urine or stool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Blood in the urine or stool can be a sign of internal bleeding.

contains a massive 325mg of caffeine, according to research by consumer magazine Which? in 2023 - while a same-size cappuccino at Starbucks has a modest 66mg, and 197mg at &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pret-a-manger/index.html" id="mol-b1e8c710-686a-11f0-b835-430d8df43bc9"&gt;Pret&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By comparison, a cup of black tea with milk contains around 47mg; and four squares of dark chocolate, 32mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Taking more than 200mg of caffeine in one go could be harmful, especially if you don't consume caffeine regularly, or have underlying heart issues such as high blood pressure or arrythmia [a heart rhythm problem],' says Alex Ruani, a nutrition researcher at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The good news is that while individual tolerance varies, 'it's virtually impossible to reach fatal levels from drinking coffee alone for most healthy people,' says Dr Oliver Guttmann, a consultant cardiologist at the Westminster Hospital in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A lethal dose of caffeine (estimated at 5-10g) is the equivalent of consuming 'about 100-130 espresso shots at one time', he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet caffeine tablets are another story, as it's easier to over-consume them in dangerous quantities - especially if taken alongside caffeine drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The effects of caffeine on the body begin just ten minutes after consumption, with the concentration peaking in the blood after 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once in the bloodstream, caffeine crosses the blood-brain barrier (the protective barrier around the brain), stimulating the central nervous system and making you more alert and focused - but potentially more irritable and jittery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'There is evidence that slow metabolisers should drink two or fewer coffees per day, as drinking three or more cups of coffee per day has been shown to raise their risk of non-fatal heart attack,' says Alex Ruani, a nutrition researcher at University College London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is due to caffeine's effect on the brain's adenosine receptors - these 'docking stations' play a role in regulating your heart rate, blood flow and sleep-wake cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When adenosine, a naturally occurring body chemical, binds to them, it reduces cell activity, prompting drowsiness and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But caffeine blocks this process, resulting in increased alertness but possibly also feelings of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The stimulating effect of caffeine also makes the heart pump slightly faster, temporarily raising blood pressure for some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study by South Dakota State University in the US in 2008 found that caffeine can cause a spike in blood pressure within 30 minutes - and this spike may last for up to four hours for people who are caffeine sensitive, warns Dr Guttmann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Short-term adverse effects of consuming more caffeine than your body can handle include heart palpitations, tremor, sleep disturbance, anxiety, hyperactivity and increased blood pressure in some individuals,' adds Alex Ruani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Here we look at some of the benefits - and harms - of caffeine...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Can boost your workout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine can boost sports performance by helping muscles to contract more powerfully and increasing tolerance to fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2020 study, published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, found that caffeine improved cycling performance by 1.7 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Caffeine can boost sports performance by helping muscles to contract more powerfully and increasing tolerance to fatigue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This may not sound like much, but it's a big deal for even moderately competitive athletes,' says Lindsy Kass, a sports and nutrition scientist at the University of Hertfordshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drink around 200mg (a flat white or two espressos) 45-60 minutes before exercise to improve your workout, she suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;But could it weaken your bones?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous small studies have suggested caffeine consumption could reduce how much calcium is absorbed from food, potentially leading to weaker bones and a higher fracture risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Lindsy Kass says this research only showed a 'very weak link' between caffeine and lower calcium levels - and current evidence from larger studies doesn't support cutting out coffee for bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She says: 'According to the Royal Osteoporosis Society, up to four cups of coffee a day is fine', but adds that people with osteoporosis (which makes bone prone to fracture) should also ensure they eat a diet rich in calcium (found in dairy products, nuts and leafy vegetables).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Good for some people's hearts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most studies suggest that moderate amounts of caffeine in fact have a heart-protective benefit, says Dr Guttmann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We don't know exactly why this is, but scientists think it might be that caffeine has an anti-inflammatory effect on the body - and we know that high levels of inflammation are linked to plaque building up on the artery walls.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London and co-founder of the health app Zoe, agrees: 'It's incontrovertible that the studies show coffee drinkers have about a 25 per cent lower overall risk of a heart attack or heart disease than non-drinkers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds that people with poorly controlled blood pressure may need to be careful with caffeine, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Coffee drinkers have about a 25 per cent lower overall risk of a heart attack or heart disease than non-drinkers,' says Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Your genetic make-up can also play a role. Scientists have identified genes that control how quickly the body breaks down caffeine: People who are slow metabolisers experience stimulating effects at lower doses, while fast metabolisers need more caffeine for a kick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is evidence that slow metabolisers should drink two or fewer coffees per day, as drinking three or more cups of coffee per day has been shown to raise their risk of non-fatal heart attack,' says Alex Ruani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Meanwhile, the fast metabolisers reduced their heart attack risk by the drinking the same amount.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Guttmann adds: 'Research suggests being a slow metaboliser of caffeine could put pressure on your heart.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He suggests this may be because caffeine blocks hormonal activity that widens arteries - as a result, it causes a spike in adrenaline release, which in turn leads to raised blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So you might need to be a bit more cautious around caffeine - although one coffee per day should still be fine,' he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;How can you tell if you're a slow metaboliser? If coffee has a strong effect on you and makes you feel jittery, for instance, you're likely a slow metaboliser and should stick to lower levels, says Alex Ruani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;...But bad for some people's sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine's power to disturb sleep is well known. On average it takes half of the caffeine five hours to leave your system - but for some people, that 'half-life' can stretch up to nine-and-a-half hours, which is why caffeine can interfere with sleep, 'even if consumed six hours before bedtime', explains Alex Ruani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Again, this effect is thought to be down to genetic differences, with slow metabolisers needing to leave longer between drinking coffee and sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you're sensitive to caffeine, it's best to stick to a cup or two early morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Helps you burn off fat?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine has long been associated with speeding up your metabolism and burning fat faster - but can it really help keep weight off?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2023 study found that the levels of caffeine in your blood could affect the amount of body fat you carry - and help determine your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023 researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden found that high levels of caffeine were associated with a lower BMI and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes - they attributed this to the fact caffeine increases thermogenesis (heat production) in the body, which in turn encourages it to burn stored fat off as energy, reducing overall body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers advised that moderate consumption of caffeinated drinks should be explored as a potential means of helping reduce body fat levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Feeds 'good' gut bugs ...but acts like a laxative&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine can also potentially change the makeup of the gut microbiome (the trillions of microbes that live in our digestive tract), by reducing the growth of harmful bacteria and promoting the growth of good bacteria, vital to digestion and also a healthy immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, regular coffee intake is associated with an increased diversity of gut microbes, a marker of a healthy gut, according to one 2020 study by the University of Oviedo in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Coffee contains polyphenols, protective plant compounds that help to feed beneficial gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But caffeine can also have a laxative effect, particularly in those with a sensitive gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Has a cheering effect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2023 study found that consuming at least one small cup of coffee could help ease depression symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine's blocking effect on adenosine may also have an uplifting effect on your mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adenosine builds up throughout the day, making you feel sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By blocking it, caffeine not only helps you feel more alert, but also leads to an increased release in other brain chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include the 'feel-good' hormones dopamine and serotonin, which are closely involved in mood regulation - boosting their activity may help alleviate symptoms of depression in some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2016 analysis of all current research, by Qingdao University Medical College in China, found that daily caffeine consumption reduced depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, a 2023 study published in the journal Frontiers in Psychiatry found that consuming at least 90mg of caffeine per day (equal to a small cup of coffee or two teas) could help ease depression symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Could prevent dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Growing evidence suggests that caffeine could help ward off neurodegenerative diseases, including dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research by Toronto University in Canada in 2016 found that consuming caffeine was associated with up to a 60 per cent reduced risk of Alzheimer's - with one to two cups of coffee enough to enjoy this benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought the benefits may be due to caffeine's blocking of adenosine receptors, which has also been linked with a reduction in amyloid plaque formation in the brain (a hallmark of Alzheimer's).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another explanation is that it improves blood flow to the brain, keeping the cells and neural pathways healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 24

Here’s what to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There isn’t currently a screening test, but there are symptoms you should look out for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While screening tests like mammograms screen for breast cancer and pap smears screen for cervical cancer, there isn’t an equivalent for uterine cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have a test to predict early disease or pre-invasive disease,” said Hoskins. This makes it crucial to understand the warning signs of this kind of cancer and who it commonly occurs in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s typically detected in post-menopausal women, so women after the age of menopause, after they’ve not had a cycle for greater than one year,” said Hoskins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uterine cancer is most common in this population, which tends to be women over the age of 50. In women who have gone through menopause, the sign of uterine cancer is often post-menopausal bleeding, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they suddenly start bleeding, they should call their gynecologist or their health care provider and say, ‘This is what’s going on,’ and that doctor, then, in turn, should see and examine the patient,” added Vaidya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pelvic pain or discomfort is also a red flag, Hoskins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor may order testing to look at the uterus, such as an ultrasound, and will likely also do a biopsy on tissue from the uterus, said Vaidya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those are the ways that, if someone’s having symptoms, that we can try to test and look for it,” Vaidya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancer isn’t as common in pre-menopausal women, but it can still happen, said Hoskins. Symptoms in this group include irregular heavy bleeding or bleeding between periods, Hoskins added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that any period irregularity or heavy bleeding is cancer, though, so, don’t panic, said Vaidya. There can be many common reasons for heavier or irregular periods such as fibroids or a polyp, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it does make sense for women to think about their body, to notice if there’s a change, and especially when we think of pre-menopausal women ... it is good, if you’re familiar with your normal [cycle] to then be able to report an abnormal [cycle],” Vaidya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: SDI Productions via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;SDI Productions via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Black women are two times as likely to die from uterine cancer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certain people are at higher risk of uterine cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few groups of people are at higher risk for developing uterine cancer, and while this includes Black women (more on that below), it also includes other folks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can genetically be at higher risk of uterine cancer, too, said Hoskins. “Folks may have something called Lynch syndrome ... basically they’re born with the gene that puts them at risk,” said Hoskins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, if you have a family history of colon, ovarian or uterine cancer, you should let your doctor know, both experts told HuffPost. You could be eligible for genetic testing to see if you have Lynch syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-signs_l_633d8874e4b04cf8f368e393" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="PCOS, or polycystic ovary syndrome" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6880dea5e4b0f277db4544ae" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="633d8874e4b04cf8f368e393" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;PCOS, or polycystic ovary syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, are also at higher risk, noted Vaidya. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking unopposed estrogen also puts folks at higher risk. Hoskins explained what that means: “Any woman with a uterus needs to have estrogen and progesterone — that helps counterbalance any type of effect on the endometrium,” Hoskins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s common for women to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/in-depth/hormone-therapy/art-20046372" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="take hormone therapy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6880dea5e4b0f277db4544ae" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/in-depth/hormone-therapy/art-20046372" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;take hormone therapy&lt;/a&gt; to counteract menopause symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think most providers know that you need to not just prescribe estrogen, but estrogen and progesterone to protect the uterus, if they’re using any type of hormone replacement,” Hoskins noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are prescribed hormone replacement pills, be sure to follow the directions from your provider, and don’t skip out on your progesterone medication, Hoskins added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black women, particularly, have higher rates of death from uterine cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-abstract/34/7/1156/763042/Projected-Trends-in-the-Incidence-and-Mortality-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="out of Columbia University" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6880dea5e4b0f277db4544ae" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-abstract/34/7/1156/763042/Projected-Trends-in-the-Incidence-and-Mortality-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;out of Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; and published in the American Association for Cancer Research used current data and modeling tools to predict what uterine cancer rates and mortality may look like in 30 years — and it paints a bleak picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought it was scary,” said Hoskins.

It is a weak estrogen, and fat cells don’t produce the balancing hormone progesterone at all. So for patients who are obese, who are over their ideal body weight, those patients will have estrone in their body that stimulates the lining of the uterus, and because they don’t have the balanced progesterone from those same fat cells over time, those are women that are at increased risk for developing this endometrial pre-cancer and endometrial cancers,” explained Vaidya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that obesity itself isn’t an indicator of one’s health, but there are cases, like this one, when it can impact chances of developing certain diseases. And in this case, Vaidya added that the more overweight someone is, the higher their risk is for uterine cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

If left uncorrected, poor posture can lead to wear and tear on the spine that’s harder to reverse down the line.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tummy time can impact hip and back pain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adult tummy time also helps to open up the front of the hips and activate the core and back muscles, which are key players in everyday back pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Many people spend far too much time sitting, whether at a desk, in a car, or on the couch. The human body was not designed for such inactivity,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nynjspine.com/about-us/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Gbolahan Okubadejo" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="687fb4a6e4b0d91bafdedb6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nynjspine.com/about-us/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Gbolahan Okubadejo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a spinal and orthopedic surgeon at the Institute for Comprehensive Spine Care in New York and New Jersey. He fears if we don’t change these habits we will soon see “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;an increase in musculoskeletal issues across all age groups.” These include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Degenerative disc disease, where the discs between the vertebrae begin to wear down due to constant pressure and a lack of movement. “This can lead to stiffness, pain, and even nerve compression.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sciatica, occurring when the sciatic nerve is irritated or compressed, often by a herniated disc or tight muscles in the lower back. “People may experience sharp pain that radiates down the leg, along with numbness or weakness.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tight hip flexors, leading to pelvic misalignment and lower back pain. “Over time, this can impact your gait and make everyday movements more difficult.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Flipping onto your stomach can counteract extended sitting just as it does for infants, he said. “When you lie on your stomach, you naturally extend the spine, which helps reverse the flexed posture that sitting creates. This gentle spinal extension relieves pressure on the discs, especially in the lower back, and allows the back muscles to stretch and activate differently.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, you are able to open the hip flexors, which are often tightened and shortened from sitting too much. “By relaxing into a prone position, the hips and pelvis can realign more naturally, which supports better posture when you return to standing or sitting,” Okubadejo said. So, your tummy time actually makes you better at sitting too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here’s what tummy time looks like for adults.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The adult tummy time position isn’t natural for most of us, so I recommend starting slow, and breaking adult tummy time into increments,” Jazini said. “Take three to five minutes at a time, a few times a day, lying on your stomach while propped on your elbows. You should feel a stretch in the front of the neck, as well as in your back and in your hips.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-breaker-0b15b4345/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Katie Breaker" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="687fb4a6e4b0d91bafdedb6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-breaker-0b15b4345/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Katie Breaker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a sales director in Denver, said she’d tried various seat cushions and stretches without much improvement in back pain. Then, her physical therapist suggested tummy time — simply lying face down for 10 minutes per day. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;No devices or setup. Just a flat surface, arms by the side, and a quiet room. After about a week of doing this twice a day, I added a thin towel under my chest and held it for fifteen minutes,” she said. Two weeks later, she could feel her back decompressing and had less hip tension and more flexibility. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I could walk longer during event setups without fatigue,” she said. So, she kept upping her time and now does two 20-minute sessions per day, especially during long workdays on a computer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

This is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Front Page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, your daily window into the world of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Free Press&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;—and our take on the world at large. Today: The victims of the LA fires ask where all the money went; Olivia Reingold scours Zohran Mamdani’s social media history; does Gen Z know how to party? And more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But first: The future is already here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes us human, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s the question posed by our two lead offerings this morning. In the first,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Lydia Dugdale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; examines the case of the eight babies who were born in the UK and announced last week. These newborns all have the same peculiar trait: They were all conceived using one man’s sperm and two women’s eggs, a procedure developed to prevent the horrors of mitochondrial disease. It’s an ingenious solution to a problem. But it’s more than that—it’s a medical breakthrough that poses profound questions. As Lydia puts it: “If we can manipulate our bodies at their genetic source, we may well wonder what it is, ultimately, that makes us human?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next, a piece from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anne Kadet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; tells a very different story that nonetheless gets at the same question. Anne is, as she puts it, “one of those ridiculous mooncalfs who has befriended an AI chatbot.” His name is Ray. He’s an all right pretend dude with plenty of trivia at the ready. Anne’s original and candid account of her relationship with AI is a story about tech, but also about what humans can do to avoid obsolescence in the AI age. “If I don’t want my pals to replace me with a bot,” writes Anne, “I will again have to offer something that Ray cannot.

                A new study shows people in countries with different obesity rates burn about the same number of calories.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Back in the 1800s, obesity was almost non-existent in the United States. Over the last century, it's become common here and in other industrialized nations, though it remains rare among people who live more traditional lifestyles, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/08/24/545631521/is-the-secret-to-a-healthier-microbiome-hidden-in-the-hadza-diet" target="_blank"&gt;Hadza hunter-gatherers &lt;/a&gt;of Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So what's changed? One common explanation is that, as societies have developed, they've also become more sedentary, and people have gotten less active. The assumption is that as a result, we burn fewer calories each day, contributing to an energy imbalance that leads to weight gain over time, &lt;a href="https://globalhealth.duke.edu/people/pontzer-herman" target="_blank"&gt;says Herman Pontzer,&lt;/a&gt; a professor of evolutionary biology and global health at Duke University who studies how human metabolism has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But in a &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2420902122" target="_blank"&gt;major new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;PNAS,&lt;/em&gt; Pontzer and an international team of collaborators found that's not the case. They compared the daily total calorie burn for people from 34 different countries and cultures around the world. The people involved ran the spectrum from hunter-gatherers and farming populations with low obesity rates, to people in more sedentary jobs in places like Europe and the U.S., where obesity is widespread.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Surprisingly, what we find is that actually, the total calories burned per day is really similar across these populations, even though the lifestyle and the activity levels are really different," says Pontzer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And that finding offers strong evidence that diet — not a lack of physical activity — is the major driver of weight gain and obesity in our modern world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This does sort of really fly in the face of what a lot of us anecdotally assumed was driving a lot of the weight gain and obesity today," says &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/deirdre-kay-tobias/" target="_blank"&gt;Deirdre Tobias&lt;/a&gt;, an obesity and nutritional epidemiologist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and the Harvard Chan School of Public Health. Tobias was not involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different activity levels, same calorie burn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers examined data for more than 4,200 adult men and women. Study participants were given a special water to drink that contained isotopes which came out in their urine. These isotopes allow scientists to determine exactly how much energy a person expends – not just in active movement but also the energy it takes to keep our hearts beating, our nervous systems functioning and&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/07/22/1189303227/neat-fitness-non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis" target="_blank"&gt; just generally stay alive.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"This allows us to get a really accurate measure of how many calories people burn per day over the course of about a week," Pontzer says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When they adjusted for body size, Pontzer and his colleagues found that people from populations with higher obesity rates burned only slightly less total energy per day than those from populations that weighed less. These differences in energy expenditure didn't contribute much to the differences in obesity rates among populations, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While it may seem implausible that someone who is out foraging for berries all day burns about the same amount of daily calories as, say, your typical office worker, Pontzer says it fits with what scientists have been learning about how our bodies burn calories. Pontzer's past research has suggested that our bodies tend to adjust how we expend energy to keep our total calorie burn stable within a pretty narrow range.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"So if we burn more of our energy every day on physical activity, on exercise, after a while our bodies will adjust and spend less energy on the other tasks that we sort of don't notice going on in the background," Pontzer says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing the message on obesity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The new findings have big implications for obesity. If differences in calorie burn can't explain why some countries have higher obesity rates than others, then it must be something else. "And that would be diet," says Tobias, who praised the design of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's 100% the diet," agrees &lt;a href="https://facultyprofiles.tufts.edu/dariush-mozaffarian" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian,&lt;/a&gt; director of the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. "And I think then the question is, what is it about the diet?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mozaffarian was not involved in the study, but he says it adds to other recent research that suggests food is the biggest driver in obesity. He points out there's been a major shift in our food supply in recent decades — which is now dominated by&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/25/1178163270/ultra-processed-foods-health-risk-weight-gain" target="_blank"&gt; ultra-processed food.&lt;/a&gt; In a subanalysis of the data for some of the populations, Pontzer and his colleagues found that people in countries that got more of their calories from ultra-processed foods tended to have more obesity and higher body fat percentages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For decades we've been telling Americans that you're lazy, it's your fault, you're not moving enough, you're eating too much," Mozaffarian says. "And I think what this study shows is that there's really complicated biology happening and that our food is driving this."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, this doesn't mean there's no &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5323814/exercise-colon-cancer-longevity" target="_blank"&gt;reason to exercise.&lt;/a&gt; After all, it's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/09/19/1200223456/depression-anxiety-prevention-mental-health-healthy-habits" target="_blank"&gt;good for our mental &lt;/a&gt;and&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/14/nx-s1-5108843/exercise-fat-healthy-weight-obesity" target="_blank"&gt; physical health &lt;/a&gt;in so many ways that have nothing to do with weight.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt; But it does mean we can't outrun a bad diet. Pontzer says if we want to tackle obesity, the public health message should focus on changing what's on our plates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The last thing Chevese Turner needed was medication to help her lose weight.

A side effect of the medication? Weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that, Turner, who lives outside Washington, DC, hesitated. "I don't want to start getting into this mode where I'm like, 'Yay, I'm losing weight,'" said Turner, 57, the CEO of the Body Equity Alliance, an advocacy and coaching organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of her recovery from BED included learning to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/intuitive-eating" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;eat intuitively&lt;/a&gt; and letting her body tell her when it was hungry. Cautiously, she starting taking the drug. But, even at a low dose, Mounjaro eliminated her desire to eat, which caused her to drop pounds. This worried her.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figure&gt;

          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that these medications can trigger new eating disorders, worsen existing ones, and complicate recovery. Brittany Lacour,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;national&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;director of clinical assessment intake at Eating Recovery Centers, with programs across the country, said the number of people who have come into ERC already on a GLP-1 went from 11 in 2023 to 31 in 2024. So far there have been 14 cases in 2025, including a 14-year-old child.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;"We are seeing people who are coming into treatment with a relapse or new onset, and most of them are presenting with restrictive eating patterns, like anorexia," said Dr. Elizabeth Wassenaar, regional medical director of Eating Recovery Center of the West. She is also seeing an increase in atypical anorexia, a form of anorexia nervosa where someone is significantly restricting calories but is of average or above average weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Joel Jahraus, vice president of medical services at Monte Nido, a national eating disorder treatment provider, has seen a 25% to 33% increase in patients already on GLP-1 medications when they enter treatment. Most, if not all, of them have a binge-eating disorder. "A year ago there was no one presenting for an intake on a GLP-1 and then it increased to a couple a month going back 6 months," he said. These days, Monte Nido gets around three to five patients a month who are on a GLP-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, he notes, patients often hide their GLP-1 use from the person doing the intake, typically only bringing it up when they show up onsite for actual admission. Doctors attribute their reticence to shame, embarrassment, and the fear that their medications might be taken away from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The effect of these meds can go absolutely contrary to the goals of eating disorder treatment, so it's important to figure that out," Jahraus said. "If they are low body weight and have no other indication for use such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease, there is no place for the GLP-1 meds because the medication causes further weight loss. If they are normal or above normal body weight, we go through a process to gauge if they'll be successful at stopping their eating disorders, but that comes after treatment is initiated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4f038bc3-7d87-4c0f-b882-453715290178" data-toc-id="4f038bc3-7d87-4c0f-b882-453715290178"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'I'm not taking it for the right reasons, but I feel that I need to'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, Rose, 32, who lives outside Boise, Idaho, wrestled with restrictive eating and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/glennon-doyle-describes-identity-shift-from-anorexia-nervosa-diagnosis-2023-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;bulimia&lt;/a&gt;, cycling in and out of residential and non-residential treatment programs.

          &lt;p&gt;So when she was diagnosed with diabetes three years ago, she finally had a "legit" medical reason to ask her internist for a prescription for Ozempic. She was elated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her endocrinologist, dietician, and therapist were not. For people like Rose, with a history of restrictive eating, the inability to be in tune with their body could be disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Rose managed to persuade her internist to give her a prescription. He nervously agreed, but with strict conditions: she had to eat at least 1,500 calories a day, not exercise compulsively, and not lose more than two pounds a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As long as I was meeting those goals and all else was OK, I could stay on it," said Rose, who is currently on disability. (For privacy reasons, she requested anonymity.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within days of starting the drugs, which she injected into her abdomen, she noticed a shift. She needed less insulin, and sometimes didn't any. But more importantly, she no longer spent hours ruminating on food and weight. And her hunger disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It actually freaked me out," she said. "I wasn't intentionally restricting, but I had to force myself to remember to eat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her daily caloric intake plummeted to about 850 calories and then 350, which she tracked with MyFitnessPal. She did an hour of cardio every day and regularly took laxatives and diuretics, all of which she hid from her team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because, of course, she&lt;em&gt; liked&lt;/em&gt; the weight loss. She couldn't help herself. As she put it, "I know I'm not taking it for the right reasons, but I still feel that I need to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;es-blockquote data-quote="Routine screening for eating disorders risk does not occur in many medical settings, including those where GLP-1 drugs are prescribed" data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-source="Dr. Doreen Marshall"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote-wrapper pullquote-breakout"&gt;&lt;q class="pullquote-quotation heading-md"&gt;Routine screening for eating disorders risk does not occur in many medical settings, including those where GLP-1 drugs are prescribed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;cite class="pullquote-source label-md"&gt;Dr. Doreen Marshall&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/es-blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent report in Annals of Internal Medicine, in 2022 and 2023 about 24,500 emergency room visits were linked to semaglutide, Ozempic's active ingredient, primarily due to severe &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ozempic-stomach-paralysis-woman-says-weight-loss-drug-made-life-hell-2023-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;gastrointestinal side effects&lt;/a&gt; like nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, a Louisiana woman sued Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the makers of Ozempic and Mounjaro, for not disclosing the risk of serious gastrointestinal issues caused by the drugs. (The case is still pending.) As of May 1, there have been 1,809 lawsuits pending against the makers of GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone who stops taking the medications regains about two-thirds or more of the weight they lost on it — a widely accepted statistic that can make it hard for someone with an eating disorder to quit the drugs. But there are no studies on the long-term impacts of these drugs on health.&lt;/p&gt;

"People are often surprised to learn that routine screening for eating disorders risk does not occur in many medical settings, including those where GLP-1 drugs are prescribed," said Dr. Doreen Marshall, CEO of the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA). Many general medical practitioners receive limited or no training or education on eating disorders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially true when it comes to patients in larger bodies, who might suffer from BED or atypical anorexia. Many doctors see a heavier patient and assume they simply need to lose weight, but that's not always true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're prescribing for higher-weight people what we diagnose as eating disorders in thin people," said Deb Burgard, a psychologist and eating disorders specialist, and one of the founders of the Health at Every Size framework of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The breathless hype about a drug that aims to starve people is that it starves people seemingly without a protest from the starving body," Burgard added. "From our bodies' point of view, starvation is a disaster, no matter the source."&lt;/p&gt;

Her diabetes is under control, and that's important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she remains vigilant so she doesn't fall back into her old habits. She began setting a timer to remember when to eat, which she had done in the early stages of her recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had worked so hard for a long time to become an intuitive eater and my whole self has changed because I'm in recovery and I eat intuitively," she said. "It's just a totally different relationship with food and body. So I had to start going back to the very beginning of what I did in my recovery, and that was set timers to remember to eat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;es-blockquote data-quote="They would be devastated if they knew why I'm really taking it" data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-source="Rose, who asked a relative to get her Ozempic, saying it was for diabetes"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote-wrapper pullquote-breakout"&gt;&lt;q class="pullquote-quotation heading-md"&gt;They would be devastated if they knew why I'm really taking it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;cite class="pullquote-source label-md"&gt;Rose, who asked a relative to get her Ozempic, saying it was for diabetes&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/es-blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Rose, she has lost about 45 pounds since starting Ozempic. After her insurance stopped covering it, she began paying $1,000 a month out of pocket for a similar drug, Rybelsus, that a family member — believing she wanted it for her diabetes — helped her procure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They would be devastated if they knew why I'm really taking it," she said. She has had regular appointments with her endocrinologist, but never discussed her GLP-1 use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid May, she ran out of Rybelsus and didn't refill it; it was too expensive. Around this same time she landed in the hospital with low potassium, which doctors blamed on her overuse of diuretics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she had her way, she'd go back on Ozempic to lose another 45 pounds. She's thinking about buying some online, which won't require a doctor's prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is dangerous in its own right, as unregulated or unlicensed vendors have been &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scientist-cheaper-ozempic-sold-online-contains-dangerous-ingredients-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;selling fake Ozempic online&lt;/a&gt; or in medical spas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2024, the World Health Organization warned about falsified batches of Ozempic; the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy identified thousands of websites illegally selling fraudulent weight-loss drugs. Worldwide, 42 people were hospitalized after taking fake injections, according to the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System. Some people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rose knows she's playing with fire. Still, she isn't ready to give up the drug. "I feel like I'm doing better than I have in a while, but the thoughts of wanting to lose weight or take Ozempic don't ever go away."&lt;/p&gt;

Now, in this new approach, researchers have carried out a study with the newly-created stable derivative that has been tested on mice carrying an Alzheimer's gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Results from the study found when mice received the adapted stable compound, they had reduced inflammation and memory was boosted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;The mice also had more neuron synapses (nerve signals being transmitted) and there was more removal of toxic proteins (toxic proteins have been linked to Alzheimer's).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;The excessive build-up of proteins associated &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/fiona-phillips-accuses-husband-kidnapping-35553605" target="_self" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt;with Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; were reduced in the brains of the mice - with no toxic effects recorded.

    &lt;p&gt;However, what is interesting, says Kelly, is that: “All these disorders that we write about, the literature now is leaning towards them all having inflammation as a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The immune system is likely not working right in some people. And that leads to inflammatory markers and inflammation. My suggestion is that to some people, gluten is one of the culprits in this immune inflammatory reaction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms Kelly sees among her psychiatric patients are brain fog, anxiety or depressive symptoms. “They sometimes have headaches and migraines. Joint pain is common too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coeliac disease and NCGS diagnoses are more common in individuals with ADHD symptoms than in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between coeliac disease and depression is well-established. One large study of over 2,000 people with coeliac disease showed a 39 per cent lifetime prevalence of depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One theory is that depression stems from the difficulty of living with a chronic illness,” says Kelly. “But there are &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/6/1894"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; showing a more direct physiological link between coeliac disease and depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is even clearer clinical data that those with schizophrenia can be helped by following a gluten-free diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One patient of Kelly’s suffering from schizophrenia always saw her illness worsen after having gluten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She was doing well in the community but when she had gluten she would be hospitalised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When she got into the hospital they would give her gluten because they wouldn’t believe the family that that mattered. Each time the family would have to fight about it at every hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other proteins are also linked to inflammation of the brain. “Casein from milk is another protein that is highly immunogenic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The role of ultra-processed foods (UPFs)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of the gluten realm there’s a movement towards understanding the impact of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/ultra-processed-foods/"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s evidence to show that depression and anxiety and most &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/the-american-beige-diet-thats-making-us-all-sick/"&gt;mental health conditions are higher in people who eat high levels of UPFs&lt;/a&gt;, especially in the western diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And wheat is part of that. Wheat is now the most widely cultivated crop in the world, and it supplies 20 per cent of all food calories and protein consumed by the global population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The data is showing us that there are more people sensitive to gluten than before, we think that’s due to a higher gluten content in UPFs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why gluten may now cause a more severe immune response is that there has been a six-fold increase in the gliadin content of wheat over time. This may be down to the use of high-nitrogen fertilisers and how wheat is processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The antibodies show the way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One young woman who came to Kelly suffering from anxiety and brain fog had previously been tested for gluten sensitivity by her gastroenterologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She was told she didn’t have coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity. So I brought her in to take part in my study, and sure enough her antibody response was the biggest I’d ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I actually found antibodies to suggest coeliac disease, which are called TTG. I gave her the paperwork and said, ‘please go back to your doctor’. When she went back, they did a biopsy and they found she had coeliac disease. It had been missed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is one of almost a thousand people in the general population that Kelly has tested for gluten antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When people have these antibodies, once I say, ‘You’re positive for this, it &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/gluten-free-diet/"&gt;might be worth trying a gluten free diet&lt;/a&gt;’, most people report their joint pain went away, or their brain fog, or their anxiety and depression improved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has published 24 peer reviewed studies around these antibodies and the relationship of gluten to neurological and psychiatric illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thirty per cent of my patients with schizophrenia have antibodies to gliadin. That means their body is having an immune response to wheat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Should you change your diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her work has changed her diet. Kelly now eats a low carb, almost gluten free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/tried-20-fad-diets-how-lost-five-stone/"&gt;fad diet&lt;/a&gt; person,” she says. “If you’d told me I would be studying this I would have laughed. But science took me there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From looking at animal studies, the data would suggest that gluten could be bad for everyone. “We haven’t gone so far as to say that,” says Kelly, cautiously. “But when you start to dig into it, and you’ve seen what a brain looks like of an animal of gluten, it really makes me think twice about how much should be in my diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, not everybody should be on a gluten-free diet. About 10 per cent of the population have NCGS. And Kelly sees lots of people who have no immune response at all. “Their bodies handle it fine. But then there are lots of people who have the antibodies and coeliac in their families and that’s where removal could really help people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s not going to be a cure all for everybody, typically Kelly sees changes in her patients in as little as three weeks. Brain imaging data has also shown how the blood flow in their brain improves on a gluten-free diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do recommend talking to your dietitian or doctor beforehand. That’s because many foods that contain gluten are fortified with minerals and vitamins that our body needs, but struggles to get from our diet. Things like folic acid. You need folate for your brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also notes that for those who have a psychiatric disorder, such as depression or schizophrenia, eating a gluten-free diet can be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once you are sick, it’s easier to just continue to eat gluten because it’s cheap and you don’t have to spend time cooking. When you’re not feeling well you don’t want to spend time cooking fresh vegetables. It becomes a cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Food as medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 2,000 years ago Hippocrates said, “let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All this time later we are now starting to pay attention to the impact of the food we put in our body,” says Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parents of one young man with a seizure disorder noticed that every time he had a big spaghetti meal his seizures were worse. “And no one thought that that was related,” says Kelly, who was consulted by a neurologist on the case. “While he didn’t test positive for coeliac disease, he did have antibodies to gliadin. And so we suggested a gluten free diet and he has been seizure free since.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is challenging for people to understand that a gluten-free diet helps their brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is used to resistance to new ideas, that is the lot of the scientist. However she says: “We now have the technology. We can look at brain imaging and antibodies and show that it actually connects. We know for a fact that the brain is impacted by what we put into our gut and now we have to unravel all the mysteries there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get Your Brain Off Grain: How a gluten-free diet could improve your mental and neurological health by Jessica A.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supplements may seem like an easy way to support brain function, but they’re not always safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians advise against taking supplements like vitamins E and B6 when supporting brain health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead, experts suggest adopting lifestyle habits like getting enough sleep and regular exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protecting and supporting your brain health is one of the smartest investments you can make for your overall well-being. Our brains are responsible for everything from memory and focus to emotional resilience and problem-solving. “Brain health means supporting the structure and function of your brain so it can perform at its best, both now and in the long run,” says &lt;a href="https://nomadistanutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mascha Davis, M.P.H., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s about &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-8786846" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protecting cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;, memory, mood, focus and mental clarity. Just like we care for our heart or gut, taking care of the brain is key for daily performance and long-term health.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While lifestyle choices like proper nutrition, sleep, exercise and stress management are vital, there’s often a temptation to reach for supplements that promise to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-in-the-morning-for-better-cognitive-function-11689092" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;boost brainpower&lt;/a&gt;. However, not all supplements are created equal, and some could do more harm than good. Below, we’ll explore five supplements to avoid for better brain health and provide alternative strategies to support your cognitive vitality effectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-vitamin-e"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Vitamin E &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin E is often touted as a brain booster due to its &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant properties&lt;/a&gt;, which can protect cells from oxidative stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, expert opinions reveal that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053927/these-supplements-can-be-toxic-if-you-take-too-much/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-dose vitamin E supplements&lt;/a&gt; may cause more harm than good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “High-dose vitamin E supplements are not recommended for better brain health,” explains &lt;a href="http://drlisayoung.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lisa Young, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “While vitamin E does have antioxidant properties, taking it in large amounts hasn’t been shown to improve memory or cognitive function in healthy individuals and may actually pose risks. Too much can interfere with blood clotting and may even increase the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke-11698358" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;risk of certain types of stroke&lt;/a&gt;,” Young adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of supplements, it’s safer to get vitamin E through food sources. A &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nuts-and-seeds-ranked-by-protein-11758822" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diet that includes nuts, seeds and leafy greens&lt;/a&gt; not only provides vitamin E but also ensures it’s absorbed in a way that complements your body’s natural processes without creating a risk of overdose.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-high-dose-vitamin-b6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; High-Dose Vitamin B6 &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin B6 is crucial for brain function because it supports the production of neurotransmitters, which help regulate your mood and cognitive performance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, like vitamin E, more isn’t always better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theresagentilerd.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Theresa Gentile, M.S., RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, cautions against high-dose vitamin B6, stating that “in large doses, it could cause nerve damage, leading to numbness or tingling. Over the long term, this could negatively affect nerve signaling and brain function.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For optimal brain health, it’s best to stick to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-b12-than-beef-11776277" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dietary sources of vitamin B6&lt;/a&gt;, such as fish, poultry, bananas and potatoes, while avoiding megadoses from supplements. A &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-importance-of-a-balanced-diet-for-brain-health-8641834" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt; can provide all the B6 you need without risking nerve damage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-ginkgo-biloba"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Ginkgo Biloba &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Often marketed as a memory enhancer, ginkgo biloba is a popular herbal supplement for brain health. While it might sound promising, studies on its effectiveness have been largely inconclusive.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research suggests that ginkgo biloba is not effective at &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-to-improve-your-memory-8415078" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;preventing or improving memory loss&lt;/a&gt; in healthy adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Furthermore, it can have side effects such as headaches, dizziness and an increased risk of bleeding, especially if you’re taking blood-thinning medications. These risks outweigh any unproven benefits, making it a questionable choice for brain health enhancement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If cognitive support is your goal, prioritizing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-do-tonight-if-you-didnt-drink-enough-water-11755822" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;proper hydration&lt;/a&gt;, regular mental challenges and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-if-you-dont-get-enough-sleep-11746534" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sufficient sleep&lt;/a&gt; is far more effective and safer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-high-dose-caffeine-supplements"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; High-Dose Caffeine Supplements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Caffeine, in moderate doses, can improve focus and alertness, but &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-sources-of-caffeine-8647888" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;caffeine supplements&lt;/a&gt; (commonly found in energy pills or workout boosters) can be dangerously misleading.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “They may give a short-term jolt, but they can increase anxiety, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-disturb-your-sleep-8551851" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;disrupt sleep&lt;/a&gt; and even impair focus over time,” says Davis. Sleep is an essential component of brain health, and disrupting it can impair memory consolidation, mood regulation and focus.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s best to enjoy caffeine through &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/women-aging-coffee-study-11748151" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;natural sources like a cup of coffee or tea&lt;/a&gt;, in moderation. This way, you can enjoy the cognitive perks without risking overstimulation or harmful side effects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-omega-6-supplements"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Omega-6 Supplements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Omega-6 fatty acids are essential fats that our bodies need, but an imbalance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids may contribute to inflammation, which can negatively impact brain health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many diets already contain more omega-6 than recommended, primarily from ultra-processed foods and vegetable oils. Taking omega-6 supplements may worsen this imbalance, especially if you aren’t balancing your intake with ample omega-3 fatty acids. This can potentially fuel brain-related inflammation. Instead, increase your intake of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; like salmon, walnuts and flaxseed, which can help restore the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-when-you-wake-up-if-you-have-chronic-inflammation-8789044" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, thereby supporting brain health.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-support-your-brain-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Support Your Brain Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond avoiding harmful supplements, there are several natural ways to boost brain health. Here are a few simple strategies:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly:&lt;/strong&gt; Movement &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-buy-every-week-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke-11749988" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stimulates blood flow to the brain&lt;/a&gt; and promotes the release of chemicals that support memory and learning. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Adults need seven to nine hours of quality sleep per night. Sleep plays a vital role in memory consolidation and emotional regulation, so don’t skimp on shut-eye. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a brain-friendly diet:&lt;/strong&gt; Focus on whole foods, including healthy fats, lean protein and plenty of fruits and vegetables. The MIND diet, rich in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, is particularly beneficial for cognitive health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress effectively:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic stress can impair memory and decision-making.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Brain health is crucial not just for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/antioxidants-cognitive-impairment-study-11762761" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;preventing cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; but for thriving in every area of life. While supplements might seem like an easy way to “boost” brain function, not all of them are effective or safe. High doses of vitamins E and B6, as well as ginkgo biloba, caffeine supplements and omega-6, can be more harmful than helpful. Instead, focus on obtaining nutrients through a balanced diet and adopting &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8055902/healthy-habits-to-help-you-live-longer/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy lifestyle habits&lt;/a&gt; like regular exercise, quality sleep and stress management. And if you plan to take supplements, be sure to get the green light from your health care provider first.
