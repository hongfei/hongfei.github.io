But the torrent of sirens early on the morning of September 17 was enough to briefly rouse me from bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I found out later that day that a five-alarm fire involving more than 200 firefighters had &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/20/nyregion/red-hook-warehouse-fire.html"&gt;ripped through a 150-year-old artists’ warehouse&lt;/a&gt; in the neighboring area of Red Hook. It was one of the biggest New York has experienced this year, and though no one was killed, the work of more than 500 artists may have been destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The Red Hook fire was a tragedy for New York’s already struggling artistic community, but it got me thinking about the state of urban fires in the US today. As long as cities have existed, fires have been a threat. Rome &lt;a href="https://www.thecollector.com/did-emperor-nero-start-the-great-fire-of-rome/"&gt;famously burned to the ground&lt;/a&gt; in 64 CE — though not, as was long assumed, at the hands of the Emperor Nero — while the diarist Samuel Pepys &lt;a href="https://notesfromtheuk.com/2025/08/08/samuel-pepys-the-great-fire-of-london-and-a-wheel-of-parmesan-cheese/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CNobody%2C%20to%20my%20sight%2C,soldiers%20if%20they%20were%20needed."&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; how “even the very stones of churches” burned in London’s Great Fire of 1666.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here in the US, the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 &lt;a href="https://www.badgeandwallet.com/news/10-most-memorable-fires-us-history#:~:text=October%208%2C%201871%20was%20an,was%20also%20largely%20under%20reported."&gt;consumed&lt;/a&gt; 3.3 square miles of the city, and left 100,000 people homeless. As late as the 1970s, the Bronx in New York was for a time averaging &lt;a href="https://shoeleather.podcasts.library.columbia.edu/podcast/the-bronx-is-burning/"&gt;as many as two fires &lt;em&gt;per hour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, part of an endless conflagration that ultimately destroyed 80 percent of the borough’s housing over the course of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As the Red Hook disaster shows, fire is still a threat, especially to older buildings. But beneath the sound of those sirens is a story of underappreciated progress toward ever greater safety. Compared with 1980, the per-capita civilian fire death rate &lt;a href="https://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/nfpa/journal_2024winter/index.php"&gt;has fallen&lt;/a&gt; by roughly two-thirds — from about 28.6 deaths per million people to around 11 per million in 2023. Total reported fires are also &lt;a href="https://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/nfpa/journal_2023winter/index.php?startid=58&amp;amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;down&lt;/a&gt; by half over that time period, and injuries have fallen by more than half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As the terrible Los Angeles fires at the start of the year demonstrated, the &lt;a href="/climate/398719/los-angeles-fire-reconstruction-insurance-housing"&gt;growing risk to urban areas from wildfires&lt;/a&gt; presents a new and dangerous threat to US cities. But even with those rare but spectacular disasters, America’s homes and buildings are far less vulnerable to deadly fires than they once were. And we’ve gotten here through the accumulation of small improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoke alarms that work&lt;/strong&gt;: There may be no single more important fire safety feature than the humble smoke alarm. While the very first automatic smoke fire alarm was invented in 1890, as late as 1977, less than a quarter of all households in the US had smoke alarms, which is one of those facts of the recent past that leaves me gobsmacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Today alarms are &lt;a href="https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/research/nfpa-research/fire-statistical-reports/smoke-alarms-in-us-home-fires?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;now present&lt;/a&gt; in the vast majority of US homes — and when they’re working, the death rate per reported home fire is about 60 percent lower than in homes without a working alarm. Modern building codes also now usually require interconnected systems and alarms in bedrooms. But they have to be checked consistently to make sure they actually work — a large share of fatal fires still occur in homes with no alarm &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; one that failed to operate. And battery-powered smoke alarms are safer than those that are hardwired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic sprinklers: &lt;/strong&gt;If a fire does break out, more buildings have automatic sprinklers to quench them. Sprinklers can make a huge difference: the per-fire civilian death rate is &lt;a href="https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/research/nfpa-research/fire-statistical-reports/us-experience-with-sprinklers?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;roughly&lt;/a&gt; 90 percent lower when sprinklers are present than when no automatic extinguishing system is installed. Most new multifamily houses and apartment buildings are required to have them by code, and they’ve become more common in other new construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safer furnishings and interior finishes.&lt;/strong&gt; After years of debate, the US &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/New-Federal-Safety-Standard-for-Upholstered-Furniture-Fires-Goes-into-Effect?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;adopted&lt;/a&gt; a national smolder-resistance standard for upholstered furniture in 2021, which federalized an existing California code. Upholstery that’s less prone to ignite from a dropped cigarette or similar ember means fewer small room fires becoming structure conflagrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less smoking — and “fire-safe” cigarettes.&lt;/strong&gt; Cigarettes, man — they can kill you in so many ways, including by accidentally igniting a house fire. In 1980 there were &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/future/sites/maine.gov.dps.fmo/files/inline-files/nfpa_home_fires_started_by_smoking.pdf"&gt;an estimated 70,800 smoking-related cigarette home fires&lt;/a&gt; leading to 1,820 deaths. But cigarette smoking in the US has &lt;a href="/public-health/410443/vaping-conundrum-public-health-youth-ecigarettes"&gt;fallen significantly&lt;/a&gt;, meaning fewer cigarettes to trigger fires, and all states now require so-called “fire-safe” cigarettes that are less likely to ignite. By 2016, the number of smoking-related fires had fallen to 16,500, causing 660 deaths, even as both population and the number of buildings had increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better electrical and heating safety.&lt;/strong&gt; Modern building codes now &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/afci.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;require&lt;/a&gt; safeguards like arc-fault circuit interrupters (AFCIs) that cut power when wires start arcing behind walls, which can risk sparking sudden fires. While heating equipment is still a major cause of fires, heating–related fires &lt;a href="https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/statistics/fire-estimate-summary-series.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;fell&lt;/a&gt; by a third between 2010 and 2019, thanks in part to &lt;a href="https://code-authorities.ul.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ul_ElectricHeaterTipoverProtection.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;appliance improvements&lt;/a&gt; like automatic space heater shutoffs and temperature controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-boring-important-work-of-making-homes-fire-resistant" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The boring, important work of making homes fire-resistant&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These fire safety improvements didn’t just happen. Each required regulators, often learning from fire disasters of the past, to &lt;a href="https://www.iccsafe.org/building-safety-journal/bsj-dives/fema-highlights-the-life-and-property-savings-of-building-codes/#:~:text=More%20Than%20$1%20Billion%20Saved,Introduction%20of%20fire%20sprinkler%20systems"&gt;institute new building codes and new product safety requirements&lt;/a&gt;. Public service campaigns pushed people to get smoke alarms for their homes and warned them of risky behaviors like smoking in bed. These are the engines of progress that get overlooked, but have directly saved countless lives over the course of decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We can never know when a fire is prevented. But maybe my life was saved — and maybe yours as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The progress has been uneven. Most US fire deaths still happen where we sleep: homes account for the clear majority of civilian fire fatalities. The risks &lt;a href="https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/statistics/v21i3.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;concentrate&lt;/a&gt; among older adults, people with disabilities, and lower-income households living in older buildings, where missing alarms, space-heater misuse, or unsafe extension cords are more common. And we can &lt;a href="https://stories.tamu.edu/news/2025/01/14/los-angeles-fires-demonstrate-rising-threat-of-wildfires-in-urban-areas/#:~:text=WUI%20areas%20are%20often%20(though,especially%20vulnerable%20to%20wildfire%20hazards."&gt;expect the risk of wildfires&lt;/a&gt;, including those that directly threaten cities, will only grow in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But we shouldn’t miss how far we’ve come from the days when the Bronx — and neighborhoods throughout the country — &lt;a href="http://decadeoffire.com/"&gt;was burning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter. &lt;a href="/pages/good-news-newsletter-signup"&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNcFlRRlFFbElEUDRzWlpqTkhmTU96MWN3SFZYc1IzN0VSSEhwNDBHeWYzMzhkVTVPWlBNWHRtdlJ2VXFjTEk2QWxYRW1oREdvaTJaZ2NFVVB2Q2lpOTFaXzUySEx4ZUVGZ0lCRlBfU2tqSmNTMXdySERTTFVJR3RQaXZZdUlkclE3YWNNOHBNcHFTeXVIUnJ4QVlqVk9LOUxhYTVndndnblg</guid></item><item><title>“我使用人工智能来发现我的皮肤癌–它挽救了我的生命” -《独立报》</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/ai-skin-cancer-nhs-melanoma-b2835223.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 eWHDRo sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iBibVd"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 dDhojf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 cUJDWn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 jEZjIj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

Curious, she decided to scan a patch of skin that she had largely ignored but that had slowly changed colour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system flagged the lesion for urgent review under the &lt;a href="/topic/nhs"&gt;NHS’s&lt;/a&gt; two-week suspected cancer pathway. That same day, Lynsey’s referral was sent off to Chorley Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t believe it,” she said. “I just kept thinking, what if I hadn’t said anything?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-left"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 gAZoaM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/14/15/Lynsey-Roberston-ignored-her-mole-for-years.png" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/14/15/Lynsey-Roberston-ignored-her-mole-for-years.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/14/15/Lynsey-Roberston-ignored-her-mole-for-years.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Lynsey Robertson ignored her mole for years" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-346242"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Lynsey Robertson ignored her mole for years&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Supplied)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mole didn’t hurt and although friends had occasionally asked about it, she had always dismissed it, assuming it wasn’t serious enough to bother a doctor with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d had it for years,” she said. “It wasn’t causing me any trouble. I thought I’d be wasting the GP’s time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was quickly booked in for minor surgery to remove the mole, but was diagnosed days later with malignant &lt;a href="/topic/melanoma"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt;, an aggressive form of skin cancer that can spread rapidly through the body. Lynsey then underwent a second procedure to remove all cancerous cells, which was successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is now urging others not to ignore changes in their skin or unusual marks or moles, saying that had she not tested the technology at her office, “who knows what could have happened”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed by Skin Analytics, the cancer detection system &lt;a href="/news/uk/home-news/nhs-people-britons-national-institute-for-health-and-care-excellence-b2742713.html"&gt;uses AI to analyse images of lesions&lt;/a&gt; and detect potential signs of skin cancer.

The images are then assessed by &lt;a href="/topic/ai"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt;, and any lesion that is flagged will then be further reviewed by a dermatologist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology, which has been deployed across the country, has been conditionally approved for the next three years and has assessed more than 170,000 &lt;a href="/topic/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; patients since 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rapid adoption of &lt;a href="/news/health/ai-depression-mental-illness-research-b2828460.html"&gt;artificial intelligence in healthcare&lt;/a&gt; has sparked debate in the UK as some voice concerns around data security,&lt;a href="/news/health/ai-healthcare-patients-nhs-b2732070.html"&gt; data bias&lt;/a&gt;, and a lack of human empathy. In its 10-year health plan for England, the government said it would “make the NHS the most AI-enabled health system in the world with AI seamlessly integrated into clinical pathways.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 aagrY"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/24/14/02/01JMVC5JY0X5KRDZSJK0FBCR8Q.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/24/14/02/01JMVC5JY0X5KRDZSJK0FBCR8Q.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/24/14/02/01JMVC5JY0X5KRDZSJK0FBCR8Q.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The NHS employs AI in hospitals and clinics" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-346244"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The NHS employs AI in hospitals and clinics&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (King’s College London/PA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, health secretary &lt;a href="/topic/wes-streeting"&gt;Wes Streeting&lt;/a&gt; said: “The AI revolution is here, and we are arming staff with the latest ground-breaking technology, so patients get faster and smarter care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This government is reinstating the UK’s position as a technology superpower - driving vital investment and economic growth as we build an NHS fit for the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The skin cancer screening technology is the world's first AI legally authorised to detect cancer without a doctor present, according to Skin Analytics. It says that polling of 2,000 people found that 73 per cent believe the NHS has a duty of care to use technology that has proven benefits for patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urgent skin cancer referrals have skyrocketed in the UK in the last decade. According to the NHS, more than 17,000 people are diagnosed with melanoma each year, and around 2,300 people die annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report from Cancer Research this month found that just half of the UK’s cancer patients were being &lt;a href="/news/health/ai-nhs-app-hospital-admissions-waiting-lists-b2827458.html"&gt;diagnosed within NHS England’s target &lt;/a&gt;of 28 days. According to Skin Analytics, 71 per cent of people believe regulated AI could help reduce NHS wait times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 10:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPUkM4THdsSEpidDlYU0pLeXZXb290b24xTm9GZGo0R3ZqREt5NzdJZXkyRjdRMmdHUVFNYXBWQ3JkWEJPOVBTQ3FRRWt0dFR3NTA5STdaeUQxWTktQVVrc01KNjdFQlNVc0pKSENSSkFaZU0wWWdNQU5GWXE0eHZVaXk2UzVCdWp6Vkc0</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，类风湿性关节炎在疼痛前几年无声无息地开始-今日医学新闻</title><link>https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/rheumatoid-arthritis-silently-starts-years-before-pain-study</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/arthritis-prevention -GettyImages-960937956-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/arthritis-prevention -GettyImages-960937956-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/arthritis-prevention -GettyImages-960937956-Header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/arthritis-prevention%E2%80%AF-GettyImages-960937956-Header-1024x575.jpg" alt="A woman jogging in a field against a backdrop of a clear sky" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Frheumatoid-arthritis-silently-starts-years-before-pain-study&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F09%2Farthritis-prevention%E2%80%AF-GettyImages-960937956-Header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Rheumatoid%20arthritis%20begins%20years%20before%20symptoms%2C%20study%20finds" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/arthritis-prevention -GettyImages-960937956-Header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;Scientists have found that rheumatoid arthritis may begin years before symptoms start showing.

While these antibodies are useful in predicting whether a person will develop RA, a significant portion of individuals with these antibodies do not develop this condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adt7214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; characterized the changes in individuals’ immune systems as they progressed from being at risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis to actually showing clinical symptoms. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Characterizing this immune profile in at-risk individuals who progress to clinical rheumatoid arthritis could allow the early detection of this condition and the development of preemptive therapies for this at-risk population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s author, &lt;a href="https://vchs.ucsd.edu/about/leadership/firestein.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Gary Friestein&lt;/a&gt;, MD, senior associate vice chancellor for health sciences at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, said, “Most people who are at-risk for RA never develop the disease. That makes prevention studies difficult because some individuals who do not need therapy will be treated with medicines with potential side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope that the findings from this study will directly support new ways to predict RA as well as potentially identify targets for prevention trials,” added the study’s co-author, &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/17168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Kevin Deane,&lt;/a&gt; MD, Professor of Medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition in which the body mistakenly produces an immune response to healthy tissue, specifically the lining that covers the joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease-modifying drugs used for the treatment of RA cannot reverse the damage, but can prevent the progression of the disease and help manage the condition. However, studies suggest that &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/64/1/65/7816327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;5 to 27%&lt;/a&gt; of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis do not respond to these treatments, and relapse is also common after remission in individuals who respond to treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection of individuals at risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis can help prevent the condition from progressing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Currently, once someone develops the swollen joints of RA, the disease is usually ‘forever,’ meaning that they will need to be on treatments for life. Furthermore, worldwide, RA affects millions of people’s lives and costs billions of dollars to manage,” said Deane.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we find ways to prevent the first swollen joints in RA, or even ‘reset’ the immune system in an at-risk stage, this could lead to people never getting full-blown RA — or having a much milder form of disease. That could have huge benefits for individuals’ well-being, as well as for public health.”&lt;br&gt;— Kevin Deane, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis exhibit elevated levels of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) 3-5 years prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Approximately 30-60% of individuals with elevated ACPA and RF levels go on to develop rheumatoid arthritis. In other words, ACPA and RF levels are not accurate predictors of progression to RA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attempts are currently underway to develop preemptive treatments to prevent the development of rheumatoid arthritis in the at-risk population expressing ACPA and RF. For instance, studies have shown that the drug &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(23)02650-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;abatacept&lt;/a&gt; can reduce the risk of rheumatoid arthritis development in this at-risk population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The characterization of the changes in the immune profile of at-risk individuals who develop RA could help understand the mechanism of the disease and more effectively target the subset of at-risk individuals who progress to develop RA symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s author, &lt;a href="https://alleninstitute.org/person/mark-gillespie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mark Gillespie&lt;/a&gt;, Ph.D., Assistant Investigator at the Allen Institute, explained, “Prior to this study, the field lacked an understanding of the biology of the ‘at-risk’ period and the changes that occur when individuals who are at-risk for RA go on to develop clinical disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present study, the researchers examined the changes in the immune profiles of at-risk individuals who later developed rheumatoid arthritis, referred to as converters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune profiles of converters were compared with the profiles of at-risk individuals who did not develop RA, referred to as non-converters, and healthy individuals who showed absence or very low levels of ACPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study consisted of 45 at-risk individuals, with 16 of them developing rheumatoid arthritis during the follow-up period, and a group of 11 individuals with early clinical rheumatoid arthritis. The control group consisted of 38 healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that at-risk individuals exhibited increased levels of inflammatory proteins in their circulation compared with healthy controls at the start of the study. This sign of systemic inflammation was present in at-risk individuals, regardless of whether they developed rheumatoid arthritis during the follow-up duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there was an increase in the number of immune cells, such as &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557618/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;monocytes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, that are involved in inflammation in both converters and non-converters. Moreover, these immune cells showed increased expression of inflammatory genes and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were unable to detect any differences in gene or protein expression in immune cells between converters and non-converters at the start of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then characterized changes within the group of converters from the time of their last visit without clinical symptoms to their next visit when they were first diagnosed with clinical RA. These changes in the immune profile of converters were compared with those in healthy controls over a similar time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autoimmune conditions are caused by the immune system’s failure to distinguish between the body’s own proteins and foreign proteins or antigens from germs. Autoimmune conditions are characterized by a dysfunction of &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459471/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;T and B lymphocytes,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; which are crucial components of the immune system involved in producing a coordinated response in an antigen-specific manner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present study, the researchers found changes in gene expression of B and T cells in converters, suggesting the activation or stimulation of these cells. Naive lymphocytes become activated upon their exposure to antigens, leading to their proliferation and differentiation into effector cells or memory cells. The short-lived effector cells are involved in the immediate immune response, whereas long-lived memory cells facilitate a faster response to future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naive or memory B cells are activated upon binding to an antigen, leading to their proliferation and differentiation into antibody-producing effector cells. In rheumatoid arthritis, subsets of B cells produce autoantibodies against the lining of joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When cells become pro-inflammatory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present study, naive and memory B cells in converters exhibited changes in their gene expression profiles that suggested their activation. In other words, the B cells showed a shift towards a pro-inflammatory state. Moreover, the researchers identified a subset of activated memory B cells in converters with a profile similar to those found in clinical rheumatoid arthritis patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helper T cells, which express the CD4 protein on their surface, interact with B cells and are essential for the activation of B cells. Consistent with the increase in activated B cells in converters, the researchers also found an increase in the population of effector CD4 T cells in this group of individuals. Moreover, these CD4 T cells showed increased expression of genes that are involved in B cell activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The activation of B cells and the increase in the number of helper T cells in converters suggest a shift toward increased autoantibody production, which could contribute to disease progression. In addition, naive CD4 T cells also showed changes in gene regulation mechanisms, priming them to differentiate into effector cells capable of promoting B cell activation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking and feeling ‘healthy’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our team discovered that during this ‘at-risk’ period, where individuals look and feel healthy, their immune systems are dramatically different.

Researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark, publishing their work in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-025-00468-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, report that a specific pattern of communication between the brain and the stomach reflects how individuals feel emotionally and psychologically. Their findings suggest that these gut-brain interactions can indicate a person’s levels of anxiety, depression, well-being, and overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that emotions are linked to physical sensations in the gut is widely reflected in language. People often talk about having “butterflies in the stomach” when nervous, or feeling “sick to the stomach” when distressed. Yet, despite these common expressions, most scientific attention in the field of brain-body interaction has focused on other organs, such as the heart and lungs. These areas have long been studied for their roles in emotion and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were struck by how little was known about how the stomach, in particular, interacts with the brain. While recent studies have explored the influence of gut bacteria and digestion on mental health, very little work had been done on the electrical rhythms of the stomach and how they may directly communicate with the brain’s networks involved in emotion, attention, and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team behind this new study wanted to explore whether a person’s psychological profile might be reflected in how strongly the stomach and brain are coupled during rest. Their aim was not to link a specific diagnosis like depression to a single brain region, but rather to identify patterns across a broad spectrum of mental health experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our interest grew from the long-standing discussion about the role of the body in shaping emotion, a question that has fascinated philosophers and scientists for centuries,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leah-banellis-phd-b192a6a0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Leah Banellis&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/leahbanellis.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;@leahbanellis&lt;/a&gt;), a postdoctoral fellow in Cognitive Neuroscience at Aarhus University. “Yet, while the heart and lungs have received much attention, the stomach has been largely overlooked. This gap struck us as especially surprising, because the link between the stomach and emotional experience feels so intuitive. It is heavily reflected in everyday language, with phrases like ‘butterflies in the stomach,’ ‘sick to our stomach,’ or ‘trust your gut.'”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was part of the Visceral Mind Project, a large-scale initiative that combines data on brain activity, bodily rhythms, and psychological assessments. The team recorded data from 243 people using a method that captures both electrical signals from the stomach (electrogastrography) and brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants represented a wide range of mental health profiles, from those reporting high well-being to others showing signs of distress, including anxiety, depression, fatigue, and insomnia. To capture this diversity, the researchers didn’t exclude people with psychiatric symptoms or diagnoses. Instead, they aimed for variation, which would allow their models to detect patterns across the mental health spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant underwent a series of recordings while lying still in the MRI scanner. At the same time, sensors on the abdomen captured the stomach’s slow electrical rhythm, which cycles about three times per minute. This rhythm, which originates from specialized cells in the stomach lining, is typically involved in coordinating digestion. But the researchers suspected it might also be linked to mental state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To analyze the relationship between stomach and brain activity, the team used a method that looks at how well the two rhythms align over time. This measure, known as phase-locking value, essentially captures the degree of synchronization between stomach signals and brain signals across different regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then combined this data with results from a comprehensive mental health questionnaire. The battery included 37 different scores across a range of domains—such as anxiety, stress, mood, fatigue, attention, sleep quality, and life satisfaction. Using a statistical method known as canonical correlation analysis, they looked for patterns that linked brain-stomach coupling with the participants’ mental health profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed a clear and statistically significant pattern. Stronger coupling between the stomach’s rhythm and brain activity was associated with poorer mental health. Individuals who reported more symptoms of anxiety, depression, stress, and fatigue tended to show increased synchronization between their stomach and brain rhythms. In contrast, those with higher levels of well-being and life satisfaction showed weaker coupling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the first time, we’ve found a scientific link between your ‘gut feelings’ and your mental health, showing a surprising connection between your stomach’s natural rhythm and your brain,” Banellis told PsyPost. “Specifically, our study revealed that stronger communication between the stomach and brain is linked to worse mental health, such as higher symptoms of anxiety, depression, stress, and fatigue, whereas weaker stomach-brain communication aligns with better mental health reflected in higher overall well-being and quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This stomach-brain signature was not random. It was localized in specific brain networks, particularly those involved in attention, cognitive control, and salience detection. Some of the strongest associations were found in regions like the superior angular gyrus and the posterior frontal and parietal areas—regions often implicated in cognitive tasks and mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers ran multiple control analyses to ensure the robustness of their findings. They ruled out the possibility that the observed effects were simply due to general brain activity patterns, fluctuations in heart rate or breathing, or basic features of stomach physiology. In other words, the association appeared specific to the coupling between the stomach’s electrical rhythm and particular brain networks—not just a general marker of body or brain state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their approach was designed to detect broad psychological dimensions rather than focus on one diagnosis. The strongest psychological pattern they found was a spectrum ranging from negative affective states (like anxiety and depression) to positive traits (like well-being and quality of life). This result suggests that the stomach-brain connection is not tied to any one disorder but instead reflects a general mode of psychological functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anxiety, depression, stress, and fatigue showed the strongest links to stomach-brain communication,” Banellis explained. “While phrases like ‘butterflies in the stomach’ or feeling ‘sick to your stomach’ are common ways we describe emotional distress, it was surprising to find such consistent and clear evidence across these symptoms. Even more unexpected was the direction of the effect: we might have assumed that stronger alignment between the body and brain would be beneficial. Instead, our findings suggest that heightened stomach-brain communication could act more like a warning signal, an internal alarm system reflecting mental strain rather than harmony.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, there are limitations. The findings are based on resting-state measurements, meaning the participants were not performing any tasks during the brain scans. This leaves open the question of how the stomach-brain relationship behaves during emotional challenges or cognitive demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the study was cross-sectional—it measured participants at one point in time. This limits the ability to determine cause and effect. Longitudinal studies that follow people over time will be needed to see whether changes in stomach-brain coupling can predict shifts in mental health, or whether interventions that alter this coupling can improve well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite our study including hundreds of participants, far surpassing the size of previous studies, and using a robust machine learning technique, our study is correlational in nature,” Banellis noted. “Thus, future causal paradigms are needed to understand this mental health associated stomach-brain relationship further.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also note that their measurements relied on surface recordings of stomach activity, which can be affected by noise and variability. Despite extensive quality control, a portion of the data had to be excluded. Future studies using higher-resolution tools or invasive methods in clinical settings might yield even clearer signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study raises important questions about causality, whether the stomach is influencing the brain, the brain is influencing the stomach, or both, as well as how stomach-brain communication develops over time and whether it can predict changes in mental health,” Banellis said. “It also opens the door to new treatment approaches targeting the disrupted brain-body connection we identified.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To build on these findings, we plan to pursue three closely connected next steps: first, case-controlled studies in patients diagnosed with anxiety or depression; second, longitudinal studies to track how stomach-brain communication evolves and whether it predicts mental health trajectories; and third, testing new interventions designed to modulate stomach-brain interactions and evaluate their potential for improving mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-025-00468-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Stomach–brain coupling indexes a dimensional signature of mental health&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Leah Banellis, Ignacio Rebollo, Niia Nikolova, and Micah Allen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 10:28:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPdVdqTV8zU1p2NDczWEc0SkhmeFFTanVJV2dsMmdXTlI2UTZjNzBFaGtYdDloUGlEcnA2ajduYk9ta1BfemJsclBEVTR6azA2QXVJamlFdnUxcmY1ZnV0c0lXMy1ZSTRaQm1TQjJ5RjNQWlhGaXBlaXRCMkdQVk1VZFVUM0k5dk9Va2VjVE5Dd3NoMHdMRDBpemFsRVZMTTVXcG8wRDZMTi1sRjl6N1E</guid></item><item><title>泰诺很受欢迎，而且很安全。我们将解释这种药物如何在体内发挥作用-今日美国</title><link>https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2025/09/28/how-tylenol-works-nsaids-autism-pain-relivers/86351608007/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On Sept. 22, President &lt;a target="_blank" href="/news/politics/donald-trump/" data-autotag="26f031d1-9924-4f10-b4e6-019d076113d5" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; pushed an unproven link between Tylenol and an increase in &lt;a href="/story/news/politics/2025/09/22/autism-tylenol-takeaways-trump-rfk-jr/86293921007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;autism in children&lt;/a&gt;, and he issued an urgent warning to expectant mothers not to take the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;What do we know about the drug? Tylenol is used to treat a several conditions, such as mild to moderate pain, &lt;a href="/story/news/health/2024/11/22/valley-fever-cases-arizona/76476521007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;, headaches, muscle aches, toothaches, backaches and colds. According to medical experts, when taken as directed, traditional &lt;a href="/story/news/2023/02/03/how-often-can-you-take-tylenol-acetaminophen/11039009002/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;over-the-counter pain relievers&lt;/a&gt; like acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) can be safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Tylenol wasn't widely used until 1950, when Tylenol Elixir for Children, a prescription medication at first, was promoted as an aspirin substitute, according to &lt;a href="https://medicine.tufts.edu/news-events/news/how-does-acetaminophen-work" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Tufts University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.

They are used for treating various types of pain and are part of different drug classes. One significant distinction is that Tylenol does not relieve inflammation; NSAIDs do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Tylenol falls under the umbrella of two other medication classes: analgesics (pain relievers) and antipyretics (fever reducers), says &lt;a href="https://uihc.org/childrens/providers/anureet-walia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dr. Anureet Walia&lt;/a&gt;, a pain management specialist with UI Health Care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;To this day, it's still a bit of a mystery how acetaminophen works. What experts do know is acetaminophen works solely on the central nervous system, while NSAIDs work on the brain and the body as a whole.

Taking your medication as recommended ensures you will receive its full benefits. Always take your current medical conditions and the sort of pain your body may experiencing into account when choosing between Tylenol and an NSAID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Here's a comparison on how theses drugs work:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Regardless of the type of pain reliever, it’s important to remember that Tylenol and NSAIDs should &lt;a href="/in-depth/news/health/2022/12/11/pain-america-expensive-complicated-problem-managing-pain/8210733001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;be taken only for episodic pain&lt;/a&gt;. “If your pain is constant and around the clock, it really should be a discussion with your physician about the source of the pain (and) how to best manage it,” Mangan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;No casual link between Tylenol and autism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The American Psychiatric Association issued the following statement on autism in response to President Trump's announcement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It is essential that the administration prioritizes evidence-based support for individuals on the autism spectrum and invests in long-term comprehensive research about the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Vaccines do not cause autism.

But are there really wasps in the figs we eat, or is this just a myth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is somewhere in between. Wasps do play an essential role in the life cycle of many types of fig trees, but most figs from the supermarket are likely bug-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="7d341865-008a-4164-a8cd-960f2950a22f-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.botanicgardens.org.au/teachers-and-schools/teacher-resources/primary-learning-resources/garden-safari-invertebrates-0" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.botanicgardens.org.au/teachers-and-schools/teacher-resources/primary-learning-resources/garden-safari-invertebrates-0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fig wasps&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are a group of hundreds of species of small insects that spend much of their life inside figs. They're about the size of a fruit fly, and they're not the same type of wasps that sting humans.

But this relationship is rather complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we think of as the fig "fruit" is actually a hollow structure called a syconium filled with tiny flowers. Generally, when a female fig wasp crawls inside a synconium from a female fig tree, she spreads pollen, which the plant needs in order to produce seeds and ripen. The hole that the wasp crawls in is very small, and she may lose her wings and antenna in the process and can even die inside the fig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it's possible that some types of figs may have dead fig wasps inside them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't necessarily mean the figs we eat have wasps inside. Not all types of figs require pollination in order to ripen. Humans eat the fig species &lt;em&gt;Ficus carica, &lt;/em&gt;which has several cultivars that are parthenocarpic, meaning they can produce ripe fruit without pollination — and therefore, without fig wasps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most figs we eat in the US have no wasps inside them," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://biology.umd.edu/people/carlos-machado" target="_blank" data-url="https://biology.umd.edu/people/carlos-machado" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Carlos Machado&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a biology professor at the University of Maryland, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="eee78aa6-647e-43ea-b4d2-f069e5713eea"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;A female wasp entering a fig. Fig wasps can't sting humans, and they're much smaller than the wasps that do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Danita Delimont via Alamy)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="c8d9cfa5-2d5b-44e1-95f4-3e43394549d6"&gt;Mission figs and Brown Turkey figs are two commonly-sold fig cultivars that don't require wasp pollination to ripen and produce seeds, Jandér said. This doesn't apply to all figs that humans eat, though; Smyrna figs, Calimyrna figs, and wild figs around the Mediterranean all rely on wasps for pollination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most wild figs do require pollination to produce ripe fruit," Machado explained. That means these types of figs could have a tiny wasp inside them — but it's still not a guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/plants/how-do-plants-with-seedless-fruit-reproduce" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/plants/how-do-plants-with-seedless-fruit-reproduce"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do plants with seedless fruit reproduce?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because a wasp was once in the fig, doesn't mean it's still in there by the time the fig is eaten. The synconia of &lt;em&gt;Ficus carcia&lt;/em&gt; have a large enough opening that the fig wasp is sometimes able to leave the structure after entering. If the wasp does die inside, her body generally gets squished and decomposes from the process of the fig maturing, Jandér said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if there were remnants of the original pollinator there you probably would not see them," Jandér explained. Any crunchy texture is more likely from the plant's seeds, not wasp remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-a2342a21-12d9-443f-8dc0-543b01059df7" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-fig-wasp-life-cycle-3"&gt;The fig wasp life cycle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="c50a1ca6-b273-44dc-8b65-d4dafd1b56b6"&gt;Although wasps sometimes die inside figs, these fruits are actually an essential part of their reproduction cycle. Just as most types of figs need wasp pollination to make new fruit, fig wasps couldn't reproduce without the help of fig trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a female wasp crawls into a fig syconium from a female tree — the type of figs we eat — she only pollinates it, because the flowers inside are too long for her to lay her eggs on. But if she ventures into a synconium from a male tree — which are called caprifigs and generally not eaten by humans — she'll start to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/wildflowers/pollinators/pollinator-of-the-month/fig_wasp.shtml" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fs.usda.gov/wildflowers/pollinators/pollinator-of-the-month/fig_wasp.shtml" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lay her eggs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There, the eggs hatch and develop from larvae into young wasps, which mate while still inside the fruit. Generally, the male wasps die inside the caprifig after mating, though they do help chew a tunnel that allows the female wasps to escape, sometimes even offering themselves as bait for the predatory ants that may be waiting outside. Eventually, the fertilized female wasps burst out in search of a new fig to lay their eggs in, carrying pollen from the old caprifig with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="08c65b1d-ba48-46e7-8edb-88c362c71881"&gt;There are over &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2023/07/unraveling-the-tangled-evolution-of-figs" target="_blank" data-url="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2023/07/unraveling-the-tangled-evolution-of-figs" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;850 species of fig trees&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and each one can only be pollinated by a specific species of fig wasp, Jandér said. The relationship between these plants and animals evolved millions of years ago, and both Machado and Jandér pointed to its importance. As a keystone species — an organism that many other plants or animals in the ecosystem rely on to survive — fig trees and their relationship with wasps continue to be of great interest to researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are other plant-pollinator mutualisms in nature, but the fig-fig wasp mutualism is possibly the most diverse and most consequential of all," Machado said.&lt;/p&gt;

Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;“The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,” said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;It’s likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;That may play out in doctors’ offices across the country, as infections long considered routine — like urinary tract infections — could become harder to treat, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report’s authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__FlexBase-sc-1fnzlkn-1 jGlKin adWrapper" aria-label="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Antimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise — unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn’t kill the germs made them stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 kNAFkD cuqaEv article-text"&gt;In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to “ &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/afcee30eb24848d38f9b855fbcc9a4ba"&gt;nightmare bacteria&lt;/a&gt; ” resistant to a wide range of antibiotics.

But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 — an increase of 460%, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 kNAFkD cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/covid-19-pandemic"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;“We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance,” said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__FlexBase-sc-1fnzlkn-1 jGlKin adWrapper" aria-label="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;The CDC’s count is only a partial picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases.

And while there’s plenty of fitness advice out there, much of it feels geared toward younger crowds rather than older generations looking to stay strong and steady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where Ed Gemdjian comes in.

You will train major patterns used every day: sit and stand, hinge, push, pull, brace, and get up from the floor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The structure is simple: start with the warm-up, then move through all six exercises as a circuit, repeating two to three times per week on non-consecutive days. He also stresses the importance of listening to your body: “If a rep hurts sharply, stop and reduce the range or choose the easier option. And if you have medical concerns, speak with a healthcare provider before starting a new program.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now let's take a look at the exercises...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-warm-up" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-warm-up"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Warm-up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;a id="elk-c2c52e65-860d-45d6-ac3d-9d4a499b0a85" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="bird-dog-3"&gt;Bird Dog&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul id="5d85505e-75a1-4aed-b75b-c2e8c3a799ea"&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 slow reps per side with a 3‑second hold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hands under shoulders, knees under hips.

This can make everyday tasks like climbing stairs, carrying groceries, or getting up from the floor more difficult than they used to feel. Maintaining strength is key not just for mobility, but for balance, energy, and overall independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemdjian highlights why this matters so much in his work at The Gym Venice. He says, “Strength training is the single best antidote to age-related decline. After 30, we lose muscle and power each decade, which erodes balance, joint health, and independence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says it's a good idea to focus on compound movements as they engage multiple muscles in one movement. “These exercises preserve lean mass, strengthen bones, and improve insulin sensitivity, keeping energy and weight manageable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, they build stronger glutes, legs, and core, making everyday tasks like climbing stairs, carrying groceries, or getting off the floor feel easier. “Strength work through &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/progressive-overload-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-help-build-muscle-and-strength" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/progressive-overload-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-help-build-muscle-and-strength"&gt;progressive overload&lt;/a&gt; also sharpens the brain via coordination and nervous-system adaptations,” he adds. “Add a little weight, reps, or range as your body adapts and loads gradually will begin to feel easier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" target="_blank" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide on Google News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=tomsguide.com" target="_blank" data-url="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=tomsguide.com" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;add us as a preferred source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

He passed away in 2022 at the age of five.&lt;/p&gt;				&lt;div class="body content-single-wrap"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PARENTS who each carry the sickle cell trait have a one-in-four chance of having a child with sickle cell anaemia — a painful reality with which Latoya Minott Smikle has had to live.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During her fourth pregnancy, the now mother of five learnt that her four-week-old baby — Aiden-Jon Amir Hall — had sickle cell disease. At the time, she also found out that she, her partner, and their three other children were carriers of the sickle cell trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After five-and-a-half years of fighting courageously, Aiden-Jon passed away due to complications with the disease in 2022. Out of that heartache and the battle she waged on his behalf, Smikle established the Aiden-Jon Amir Hall Foundation, which is seeking to raise $1 million this year to provide financial support to six individuals with sickle cell disease. The foundation is also looking to raise awareness about the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smikle recalled that before Aiden-Jon’s birth, she’d lived next door to a family who also had loved ones with sickle cell disease. She told the &lt;b&gt;Jamaica Observer&lt;/b&gt; that she became aware of their late-night hospital runs during a crisis and would hear the anguished cries of pain that echoed through the neighbourhood. Yet, she admitted, she’d never imagined that one day that would also be her reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was after Aiden was diagnosed with the disease that the Sickle Cell Unit in Kingston, which was the unit that reached out to us, they were the ones that looked up my children’s medical records from birth, and then from there they would have discovered that all of them have the trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Imagine you’re learning that you have a baby with full sickle cell, then you’re finding out that yourself has the trait and all your living children also have the trait. I don’t think I have to tell you how jarring that was. It was very shocking and very jarring, and I think for a moment I became depressed because I would have been four weeks postpartum; that’s not the easiest kind of news to bear at that time,” she told the &lt;b&gt;Sunday Observer&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smikle said subsequent checks would later reveal that it was likely her mother who had the sickle cell trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sickle cell is a genetic blood disorder that causes red blood cells to become rigid, abnormal cells that block blood flow in small vessels, leading to severe pain. An individual can either have the trait or the full extent of the disease. If an individual is diagnosed with the trait, it means that they inherited one sickle cell gene. The full extent of the disease, sickle cell anaemia, occurs when an individual inherits two sickle cell genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September is recognised as Sickle Cell Awareness Month, an annual observance dedicated to raising awareness, understanding, and support for the inherited blood disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiden-Jon was diagnosed with sickle cell anaemia, the most common and severe form of the disease that causes red blood cells to become stiff, crescent-shaped, leading to anaemia, painful episodes, and potentially severe organ damage as the sickle cells block blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like her neighbours, Smikle said late-night hospital visits soon became the norm as she cradled her baby through multiple painful crises. Hospital stays were rarely fewer than seven days, and balancing finances, work, and caring for her other children alongside her husband proved an overwhelming task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times she had no choice but to take Aiden-Jon with her to work, as her spouse served in the Jamaica Constabulary Force. She recounted one particularly difficult moment when she took him with her as she led a work event in St Ann, only for him to suffer a major crisis before it began — one that ended with another hospital admission. She shared that she was living in Clarendon at the time, but wanted her son to be treated at the specialised Sickle Cell Unit in Kingston to receive comprehensive care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My car had to become an ambulance. I had to be flying like a mad woman from St Ann to get back into town because when a child is in pain; it’s difficult hearing your child cry all the way from St Ann to Kingston. There is nothing that can soothe that pain but whatever is administered to him; for example, morphine and other drugs through IV [intravenous therapy], plus give him the requisite treatment that he needs at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very challenging. Sickle cell anaemia is a very challenging situation for parents, especially if you’re not somebody who has a job that pays well; it even becomes a greater challenge because, financially, it is a very stressful situation,” said Smikle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told the &lt;b&gt;Sunday Observer&lt;/b&gt; that her experience has revealed the gaps that exist in the system as well as the lack of empathy in society for individuals living with sickle cell disease and for parents struggling with their children. While the Sickle Cell Unit, which is located at the University of the West Indies, Mona, serves as a vital pillar by providing testing, resources, and some level of support, Smikle does not believe it is adequately funded to deliver holistic care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She noted, too, that even with assistance from the National Health Fund to cover the cost of medication for loved ones with sickle cell disease, many parents continue to struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a country where approximately one in every 150 babies is born with sickle cell disease and one in 10 adults carries the trait, she stressed that greater support and resources are urgently needed. She is hoping the Aiden-Jon Amir Hall Foundation, launched last Saturday, will bring about some of that change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe that God would have known that this would have been my journey and that I would have needed all these life experiences as a tool to help me now to be better able to help other persons, and so, for me, the foundation is to let my son continue to live and continue to impact people, because even though he was five and a half years old, he was such a loving child; people were impacted by him. The testimonies that people shared at his funeral, one would have assumed that he was an adult, but he was just a child and very impactful in such a very small window of time,” she told the &lt;b&gt;Sunday Observer&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a Christian, some people would ask me if I don’t ask God why, and why God never healed him, but my faith tells me that God sacrificed his only son through a very brutal death to provide life for me. Whatever my son went through, whatever we all went through as a family with my son, I believe there was purpose behind it to help the forgotten, to help those that are being overlooked, to help those that can’t speak for themselves because they’re in too much pain and because nobody wants to hear anything from them,” she reasoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smikle said she has identified six recipients for a grant — a number that reflects how old her son would have been if he had not passed away a month before his birthday in 2022. One of the recipients is the child of a single father who has to undergo surgery to remove his/her spleen. There will be a fund-raising dinner in October to raise $1 million for the recipients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s to build a community that can help others who are struggling; for them to understand, ‘You’re not alone.’ For me, most importantly, my child would not have survived, not because there wasn’t effort put forward to making him live the best life he lived, but I want to help someone else’s child to be able to live longer and healthier, and to reach the peak of all that they are able to achieve so that I can smile when I visit my son’s grave; I can smile and say, ‘I did it for him,’ ” said Smikle.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe it's financial problems, relationship issues, or personal pain, but they often walk through life feeling alone. While their behaviors indicate there's a problem, their words sometimes speak louder. Whether it's saying they don't care or acting like they're busy, if someone says any of these phrases casually, they're struggling more than they want to admit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn't always obvious when our loved ones are going through things, but there will sometimes be telltale signs. It could be their tone of voice or dismissive words, but it's up to us to pay close attention. Because when a person is struggling, they may be crying out for help and their words will fall on deaf ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If someone says any of these 11 phrases casually, they're struggling more than they want to admit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. 'I'm fine'&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-09/someone-says-phrases-casually-struggling-admit-i%27m-fine.png" alt="man telling friend he's fine but secretly struggling" title="if someone says any of these phrases casually they're struggling more than they want to admit i'm fine" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;loreanto | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone says "I'm fine" casually, they're struggling more than they want to admit. It's unfortunate, but most people who are struggling won't reveal that their mental health is in decline. Filled with guilt and shame, they'd rather cover it up by telling others they are fine, but this can be dangerous and hurtful to those who care about them most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if they don't see it, their loved ones have a strong desire to connect and be vulnerable with each other. As the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6125010/" rel="nofollow"&gt;American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine&lt;/a&gt; reiterated, "Humans are wired to connect, and this connection affects our health." So, while it might be tempting to push their feelings to the side, speaking to someone has a big impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/people-who-seem-they-have-their-life-together-often-hide-these-struggles"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People Who Seem Like They Have Their Life Together Often Hide These 11 Struggles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

As a result, they may shrug and give up. But if someone says "it is what it is," they're struggling more than they want to admit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loved ones might be upset to hear it, but those dealing with mental or emotional health issues may not see it as a big deal. Maybe they were taught to just suck it up and deal with it, or are so tired of trying that they have nothing left to give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holding everything in might make someone feel more isolated in the long run, causing them to pull away. But talking to loved ones can help and &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/most-powerful-phrase-for-someone-struggling"&gt;provide a safe space to open up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/subtle-habits-tell-other-people-everything-they-need-know-about-you"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 Subtle Habits That Tell Other People Everything They Need To Know About You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.

But when someone uses their tiredness as an excuse to avoid doing certain things, like socializing with friends or taking care of their daily responsibilities, it's not a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are struggling are shutting themselves out from seeking help, making their mental health issues worse. And according to a &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691614568352" rel="nofollow"&gt;study published in Perspectives on Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt;, loneliness and social isolation are twice as harmful to someone's physical and mental health as obesity is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/truly-smart-people-usually-avoid-anyone-who-does-these-things"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truly Smart People Usually Avoid Anyone Who Does These 11 Things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4.

Because despite how nonchalant they want to be, deep down inside, they're hurting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, due to their stubborn nature, it might be nearly impossible to have a one-on-one conversation about how they actually feel. So used to being closed off, they keep a lid on their emotions until they eventually explode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/wellness/proven-techniques-healing-brain-wound-humans-experience-trauma"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 Proven Techniques For Healing The 'Brain Wound' Humans Experience From Trauma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5.

Like clockwork, they'll compare their issues to someone who is seemingly struggling more than them, downplaying their own pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just because it isn't as severe as someone else's plight, doesn't make it any less important. As one &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpas0001155" rel="nofollow"&gt;study from Psychological Assessment&lt;/a&gt; found, people who invalidate their own emotions feel more upset and are more readily activated emotionally.

Whether it's from embarrassment or guilt, a person saying they don't want to talk about it is likely suffering in silence. It isn't always their intention to &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-people-hide-their-feelings-understand"&gt;shut people out or hide their emotions&lt;/a&gt;, but it might come from a place of fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, just because it's hard doesn't mean they should give up. Even if it's something small like journaling their thoughts, actively finding a way to vent is the best way to figure out what to say or, at the very least, get those emotions out in a healthy and productive way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/habits-quietly-successful-people-miserable-people-overlook"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Habits Of Quietly Successful People That Miserable Folks Always Overlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7.

Because the truth is, it does matter to them, they just don't want to express it for one reason or another. Perhaps they don't want to feel like a burden or are prone to overthinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And according to &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-mind-body-link/202504/the-hidden-cost-of-overthinking"&gt;psychologist Kyle Davies&lt;/a&gt;, "When we're constantly second-guessing or trying to outthink our emotions, we become disconnected from the deeper signals of clarity, insight, and instinct that reside within us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, it's their choice whether they want to share or not. Despite venting being good for their mental health, those who struggle will always do things on their own terms, despite it harming them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/money/people-who-never-struggle-financially-avoid-these-everyday-habits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People Who Never Struggle Financially Avoid These 11 Everyday Habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8.

Despite how difficult the obstacle may be, they can't always depend on others to save them. But this doesn't mean they have to shut everyone out completely. Even if they can't always help, at the very least, people can offer the support needed to keep moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who don't bother asking for help are always going to struggle the most. Even if they can do it all on their own, isolation and the feeling of helplessness are only intensified when they shut down. This is why it's important to let people in.

So, they choose to portray everything as just fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they might not see anything wrong with this, shutting out others is hurtful. After all, feeling abandoned can hurt just about anyone's feelings. Does this mean people have to open up completely? No, but simply saying, "I'm going through something, but I'd rather not talk about it now" is a lot better than keeping them in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/tiny-ways-people-can-tell-you-didnt-shower-even-when-try-freshen-up"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Tiny Ways People Can Tell You Didn't Shower, Even When You Try To Freshen Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11.

So, even if they're not revealing how they truly feel, eventually, it will come back to bite them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/family/quiet-struggles-only-moms-who-financially-provide-for-their-families-will-understand"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Quiet Struggles Only Moms Who Financially Provide For Their Families Will Understand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marielisa Reyes is a writer with a bachelor's degree in psychology who covers self-help, relationships, career, family, and astrology topics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="midcat-most-popular"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Related Stories From YourTango:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="rc-widget-c743d1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>YourTango</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 03:33:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNYU1pQ1AtVkUyU0pIRUlwTHVick1jdW9vVjZnYWpxc1l6bS1hc05FY3IzTVBaS3IyNzFiV18yamJmSW94V25BNHJER0tuTHg2LXJ5eDJxNmNmLWlCaXlrWl9DMVZGcEVtZlNtcDZIRWZuMlRzZHdxOFpmcFJWb01IYTl4cWJWMGp2TlM1YnNKd1J3Y2g0b1RIS0dzeW5UUQ</guid></item><item><title>8个爱好婴儿潮一代发誓-科学现在说实际上可以延长你的寿命- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/z-8-hobbies-boomers-swore-by-that-science-now-says-actually-extend-your-life/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="432" data-end="555"&gt;It’s funny—some of the things younger generations teased boomers about actually turn out to have serious health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="557" data-end="755"&gt;Science has been catching up with common sense in the last few decades, and research now shows that several of the hobbies boomers grew up with—or never let go of—are directly linked to longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="757" data-end="958"&gt;These aren’t high-tech, expensive pursuits. They’re everyday activities, woven into life without fanfare. And maybe that’s the point: the stuff that really sustains us isn’t flashy, it’s sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="960" data-end="982"&gt;Let’s get into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="989" data-end="1006"&gt;1. Gardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1008" data-end="1098"&gt;Ever wonder why so many boomers spent their weekends pruning roses or planting tomatoes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1100" data-end="1410"&gt;Turns out, gardening isn’t just about curb appeal or homegrown produce. Studies link it to lower stress, better immune function, and reduced risk of dementia. Digging in the dirt exposes us to microbes that boost serotonin. Plus, gardening keeps you moving in a low-impact way that’s sustainable for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1412" data-end="1595"&gt;One meta-analysis found that gardening interventions had &lt;a href="https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13643-024-02457-9?.com"&gt;a moderate positive effect on well-being&lt;/a&gt; and mental health across multiple studies. It’s a habit that feeds both the body and the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1597" data-end="1919"&gt;I’ve noticed this myself when I tend to my balcony plants. Even just ten minutes with my hands in soil resets my stress levels. The quiet focus of pruning leaves feels a lot like meditation—but with tomatoes at the end of it. If you’ve got a yard—or even a few pots—you’ve got a built-in therapy session waiting for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1926" data-end="1941"&gt;2. Walking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1943" data-end="2029"&gt;Boomers walked. A lot. They didn’t think of it as exercise—it was just part of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2031" data-end="2373"&gt;Now, science says it’s one of the best predictors of healthy aging. Walking improves cardiovascular health, supports bone density, and even sharpens memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2031" data-end="2373"&gt;A 2022 genetic study of over 400,000 participants found that brisk walkers had significantly longer telomeres—and suggested that walking faster could&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220420133538.htm?.com"&gt; slow biological aging&lt;/a&gt; by the equivalent of about 16 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2375" data-end="2651"&gt;The beauty of walking is its accessibility. You don’t need gear or a gym membership. Just shoes and time. It’s also underrated as a creativity booster. Steve Jobs was famous for his walking meetings, and research backs up the idea that &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xlm-a0036577.pdf?.com"&gt;walking helps with divergent thinking.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2653" data-end="2878"&gt;I learned this on a trip to Japan when I joined an older local group on their morning walk. Their energy was contagious, and it hit me: this is a habit you can keep doing well into your eighties. No extreme workouts needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2885" data-end="2905"&gt;3. Volunteering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2907" data-end="3002"&gt;Many boomers made volunteering a staple—whether at church, the library, or community centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3004" data-end="3208"&gt;Research shows that giving your time doesn’t just help others; it extends your own life. People who volunteer regularly have lower mortality rates, better mental health, and a stronger sense of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3210" data-end="3421"&gt;One prospective study found that adults over 50 who volunteered at least 200 hours per year were about &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/3804225?.com"&gt;40 % less likely to develop hypertension. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3423" data-end="3669"&gt;Purpose is medicine. And volunteering gives it in spades. It satisfies the psychological need for relatedness, something self-determination theory highlights as essential for well-being. In other words, helping others reminds us that we belong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3676" data-end="3712"&gt;4. Playing cards or board games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3714" data-end="3799"&gt;Friday night poker nights, bridge clubs, Scrabble marathons. Boomers swore by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3801" data-end="4078"&gt;Now science confirms that regularly playing games protects against cognitive decline. Social interaction plus strategy keeps neural pathways firing. In a French prospective cohort (the Paquid study), regular board game players had about &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e002998?.com"&gt;15 % lower risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt; over 20 years compared to non-players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4080" data-end="4321"&gt;Games do something else too: they create shared rituals. That weekly bridge night isn’t just entertainment—it’s community plus mental exercise. The anticipation of the game, the inside jokes, even the competition—all of it feeds longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4323" data-end="4532"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before, but when I lived in Spain for a summer, I saw older folks gather nightly in plazas to play dominoes. They weren’t just passing time—they were literally keeping their brains alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4539" data-end="4554"&gt;5. Dancing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4556" data-end="4648"&gt;If you’ve ever been dragged to a boomer wedding, you’ve seen the electric slide in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4650" data-end="4938"&gt;Beyond the cheesy moves, dancing is insanely good for you. It combines aerobic activity, balance training, and social connection. Studies show that dancing lowers the risk of heart disease and improves brain health. Some even suggest it &lt;a href="https://montefioreeinstein.org/news/2023/01/05/social-dancing-improve-cognition-reduce-alzheimers-risk?.com"&gt;reduces the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4940" data-end="5174"&gt;Neurologists point out that dancing challenges the brain in unique ways: you have to coordinate movement, remember steps, and often improvise in rhythm with others. That blend of physical and mental effort is rare outside of sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5176" data-end="5359"&gt;Plus—it’s fun. Unlike forcing yourself onto a treadmill, dancing makes exercise feel like joy. No surprise it triggers dopamine release, which is linked to motivation and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5366" data-end="5389"&gt;6. Cooking at home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5391" data-end="5445"&gt;Boomers weren’t eating out every night. They cooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5447" data-end="5652"&gt;Science backs this habit big time. Home-cooked meals tend to be healthier, with fewer processed ingredients and less sodium. Cooking also engages creativity and gives a sense of control over your health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5654" data-end="5882"&gt;One study found that people in Taiwan and Australia who cooked up to five times a week had &lt;a href="https://www.bluezones.com/2018/04/want-to-eat-better-and-live-longer-learn-to-cook/?.com"&gt;a 47 % greater chance of being alive ten years later.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5884" data-end="6157"&gt;I still remember my grandmother teaching me how to make lentil stew. At the time, I thought it was just food. Now I realize it was one of the healthiest “hobbies” she could have passed down. Cooking ties health with tradition, creating a kind of resilience you can taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6164" data-end="6179"&gt;7. Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6181" data-end="6287"&gt;Bookshelves lined with novels, biographies, or how-to guides—that was a common boomer household feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6289" data-end="6501"&gt;Reading isn’t just entertainment. It boosts empathy, reduces stress, and improves brain connectivity. A 2016 Yale study found that people who read books regularly&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953616303689?.com"&gt; lived almost two years longer&lt;/a&gt; than non-readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6503" data-end="6679"&gt;Books are also a powerful way to practice “deep focus” in a world that constantly interrupts us. That immersion strengthens attention span, which is protective for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6681" data-end="6978"&gt;Personally, I find that reading grounds me in a way scrolling never could. I’ll pick up a behavioral science book and suddenly lose hours, not because I’m distracted but because I’m absorbed. That kind of focus is becoming rare—and it might be one of the healthiest mental workouts we have left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6985" data-end="7024"&gt;8. Bowling and other social sports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7026" data-end="7097"&gt;Bowling leagues were a thing. So were golf groups and softball teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7099" data-end="7357"&gt;At first glance, they seem like just casual fun. But social sports combine three powerful life-extending elements: movement, community, and routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7099" data-end="7357"&gt;One longitudinal study found that higher diversity in social activities (e.g. clubs, groups, sports) was linked to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/79/5/gbae021/7609169?&amp;amp;login=false"&gt;lower mortality risk&lt;/a&gt; even after adjusting for health and activity frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7099" data-end="7357"&gt;The game matters less than the connection. Whether you’re rolling strikes or gutter balls, you’re winning at health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7479" data-end="7817"&gt;What fascinates me is how these activities create “third places”—spaces outside home and work where people gather. Sociologists argue these places are essential for community health, and boomers knew this instinctively. A bowling alley wasn’t just about pins. It was about friendship, laughter, and rituals that kept people coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7824" data-end="7843"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7845" data-end="7946"&gt;The hobbies that keep us alive aren’t flashy. They’re simple, social, and woven into everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7948" data-end="8132"&gt;Boomers didn’t need wearables or biohacking apps to tell them what felt good. They trusted habits that gave them connection, movement, and purpose. And now the science backs them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8134" data-end="8251"&gt;So the next time you’re tempted to dismiss a “boomer pastime,” maybe lean in. It might just add years to your life.&lt;/p&gt;

But new research suggests that the real secret might be much more straightforward — walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study in the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32175820/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; Annals of Human Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; assessed data from 5,823 American adults and determined that at least 150 minutes of walking per week was associated with longer telomeres in comparison to non-walkers. Telomeres are always-discussed protective caps at the ends of our DNA strands. They get shorter with age, and more rapid shortening has been associated with heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and premature death. I.e., longer telomeres are a marker for slower biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is in line with more comprehensive studies on physical activity and longevity. For instance, Harvard studies involving more than 650,000 participants found that consistently engaging in 150–299 minutes of moderate exercise each week assisted adults in living 3.4 years longer than their sedentary counterparts. In some instances, when combined with normal weight and dietary habits, the benefits extended up to 7 years of extra longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe walking can effectively slow down the aging process?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is effective because it's both accessible and potent. Walking increases circulation, lowers inflammation, improves insulin sensitivity, and decreases blood pressure, all of which affect how quickly or slowly our cells age. The telomere studies add richer biological complexity to this tale, demonstrating that walking doesn't just make us feel young but actually keep our DNA young, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genius of this discovery is how easy it is. Just 30 minutes of walking briskly five days a week is all it takes to meet the 150-minute goal. You don't require a membership at a gym or expensive equipment. Even dividing it into 10–15 minute walks throughout the day can be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, there is more to the equation than walking. Diet, sleep, stress reduction, and other types of exercise all enter the picture. But if one activity is simple and has proven efficacy, walking on a daily basis might be one of the most effective longevity methods out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to add walking to our busy schedules&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be hard to find time to exercise with busy work schedules and family obligations. The good news is that they are convenient and can be easily adapted to our busy lifestyles. Here are a few easy strategies to incorporate walking without throwing off our hectic schedules:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Break it down into chunks: Rather than taking a long walk, divide 30 minutes into two or three shorter periods of walking. Attempt to fit in a 10 minute walk before work, speedy one on lunch break and then a quick one after dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make active transportation a habit: Wherever possible, walk or cycle to the office, do errands on foot or park further away from locations to get extra steps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set reminders: Use phone alarms, or apps to remind yourself to move regularly, especially during long periods of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Science now establishes that walking 150 minutes a week doesn't just make one healthier — it may actually slow cell aging, protect your DNA, and add purposeful years to your life. Sometimes, the simplest steps really are the most powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7wFBVV95cUxNY3NrSDRyZjhnbXFEbWhzQTZ6RjdNRmlwVjRkcEdkVG5fOG5TN0laR2NBNXE2YmZWRGdzNlF6U1I3MDFxcHhGWDJ1YlFMWGh5elVSR3B6ZWZOREE3QVhtT2V3MU9saTBPT01HMVpPN2pBVk1MTUR1emRQLUNtSTI4SG02akt1Z1R6bWo2TmlMUmdIekVYcFlXWHN5MnNRSGk1Nzg5X0RoeUlPMkp3azdKUmx5SDZaYVhlNkZqQ29nUnhrekFaMWpFcXRXQmJ1R1hVRF9nazFTMHdJMzZON2dOSWt5dEczTzBjX3hMNVViMA</guid></item><item><title>这可能是人类第一艘飞往另一个太阳系的多代星际飞船吗？ - Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/possibly-humanitys-first-multi-generational-starship-chrysalis-to-another-solar-system/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new interstellar concept called Chrysalis sketches a 36 mile long rotating habitat designed to carry 2,400 people on a one way, 400 year trip. The destination is &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/alpha-centauri-triple-star-system-about-4-light-years-from-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alpha Centauri&lt;/a&gt;, about 25 trillion miles from Earth, a distance that rules out resupply once the ship leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan treats the vessel as a closed society that must feed itself, educate children, care for the sick, and manufacture what it needs while coasting between stars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It proposes layered habitats for farms, homes, schools, industry, and storage, all made livable by rotation that supplies gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-chrysalis-plan"&gt;The Chrysalis plan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i4is.org/who-we-are/board-of-directors/#gsc.tab=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr Andreas Hein&lt;/a&gt; is executive director of the Initiative for Interstellar Studies (&lt;a href="https://i4is.org/"&gt;I4IS&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group convened experts to see whether architecture, engineering, and social systems could be woven into a practical multi-century mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team behind Chrysalis proposes a long training phase on Earth. Early generations would live in isolated Antarctic stations for 70 to 80 years to build the habits, culture, and mental resilience needed for life off planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrysalis uses a nested shell layout around a central spine. Inner-zones grow plants, fungi, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/living-microbes-found-sealed-inside-2-billion-year-old-rock/"&gt;microbes&lt;/a&gt;, insects, and some livestock in controlled farms, mid layers hold parks, clinics, schools, and libraries, and outer shells host workshops and storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dwellings sit between community space and light industry to keep daily life close to work and services. The outermost storehouse would be robot heavy to cut human labor and risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alpha-centauri-and-proxima-b"&gt;Alpha Centauri and Proxima b&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alpha Centauri is the nearest star system, which shortens the voyage by every realistic metric. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The likely landing zone is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Proxima Centauri b&lt;/a&gt;, an Earth-size exoplanet reported to orbit in a temperate zone that could allow liquid water under some conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the ship enters the system, shuttles housed in the central core would ferry crews and equipment to the planet. The design treats that arrival as the beginning of settlement rather than the end of the mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal aims to arrive with full knowledge systems, from agriculture to medicine to materials science. It assumes no external logistics, so onboard manufacturing and repair are treated as basic survival needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-artificial-gravity-and-health"&gt;Artificial gravity and health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrysalis relies on artificial gravity from steady rotation to keep bodies closer to Earth normal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://technology.nasa.gov/patent/TOP2-311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rotation-based gravity&lt;/a&gt; is a studied countermeasure for cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning, as summarized in a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00716/full"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; that evaluated centrifuge experiments in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spin introduces tradeoffs like &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_currents/04currents1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Coriolis effects&lt;/a&gt; that can disturb balance if rotation is too fast. The nested layout helps tune spin and radius so living areas feel stable while still providing adequate effective gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiation exposure is another core risk for a centuries long voyage. The concept leans on structure and materials, using mass in the habitat shells to reduce particle flux rather than relying only on specialized shields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care sits in the communal layer near schools and parks to keep services accessible.

Fusion plant concepts and timelines remain under &lt;a href="https://www.iaea.org/publications/15777/iaea-world-fusion-outlook-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;development&lt;/a&gt; and have been mapped and evaluated extensively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors propose a 20 to 25 year construction window once industry can deliver the required systems. They treat in-space manufacturing as a mission essential capability to replace worn parts and build upgrades during cruise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy production, recycling, and life support appear across multiple layers to avoid single points of failure. Heavy maintenance and logistics live at the outer edge where robots can operate with fewer human safety constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The population would be planned to hover near 1,500 to balance resources, education, and health. That cap sits below the ship’s maximum berth count to leave margin for emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-competitions-like-this-help"&gt;Why competitions like this help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrysalis won first place in the 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.projecthyperion.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;competition&lt;/a&gt;, and the jury praised both technical breadth and attention to people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chrysalis impressed the jury with its system-level coherence and innovative design of the modular habitat structure but also overall depth of detail,” wrote the Project Hyperion &lt;a href="https://www.projecthyperion.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;jury&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chrysalis is a living spaceship where humans, robots and artificial intelligent agents share information, experiences and decision-making processes,” stated the Chrysalis team, explaining that their starship was more than hardware. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We asked participants to integrate architecture, technology and social systems to conceptualise a functional society spanning centuries, and the outcome was beyond expectations,” said Dr Hein executive director of the &lt;a href="https://i4is.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Initiative for Interstellar Studies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concept work cannot replace flight hardware, yet it shapes the questions future engineers must answer. It also documents social and cultural choices that matter as much as engines when people live their whole lives off &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/earths-atmospheric-rivers-have-shifted-towards-the-poles-causing-big-local-weather-changes/"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-chrysalis-would-prepare-for-arrival"&gt;How Chrysalis would prepare for arrival&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core would carry compact shuttles sized for surface hops, cargo, and emergency evacuation. Pilots and maintenance crews would train during the cruise so landings do not depend on a single cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food systems would keep a mix of biomes, from tropical to boreal, to preserve biodiversity and stabilize diets. That diversity lowers the risk that one crop failure cascades across the whole &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ecosystem-attack-predicting-the-success-of-species-invasions/"&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge transfer shows up in how learning is embedded in daily life. Schools would be near labs, workshops, and farms so students practice skills early and keep them across generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governance would be transparent, with planned births, shared resources, and collaborative decision tools. The aim is to prevent shocks to a small population where every loss hurts community resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 01:19:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPM2UxR1NrNUdFWlItWDFNYzJHSzBPLWUwWW02OS1LUWJ5LW9XOWdDbFdVTGF2UnYxRGtieXBQc3hxUkRWUGdZLWlfeUJsazFqVU1EU0E0REY3VHB1V0FwMWE2cmd4VXh5RFJSX2FQc1JNLWlZbklxaHJPdFdjU1ZqTk53NWZXaVRUMktkRFc1VzNIUzJuR2Fra0RLZ09UWDVVUTZQSmFGQjd2WV9GVmg3MjNUR04</guid></item><item><title>缓解膝盖疼痛并避免手术的六个简单步骤- dailymail.co.uk</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15139739/ease-knee-pain-avoid-surgery-six-steps.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When keen runner Jon Reeves, 54, began struggling to get down the stairs in the morning, he knew his knee pain was more than just sports injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The father of two from Oxfordshire had gone from daily runs and regular badminton matches to strapping up his inflamed joints and dosing himself on painkillers just to get through the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2020 doctors confirmed the cause: &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/osteoarthritis/index.html" id="mol-7df044a0-9ba6-11f0-ac66-c563bb30a77b" class=""&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt; – the degenerative joint disease that affects about ten million Britons. More than half of cases strike the knee, with 100,000 people a year ending up on the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-7dee96f0-9ba6-11f0-ac66-c563bb30a77b"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; waiting list for joint replacement surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Getting the diagnosis was devastating,’ says Jon. ‘I thought it was an old person’s disease and I was worried it would only get worse.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initially prescribed anti-inflammatory drugs and exercises that were painful and brought little relief, Jon’s condition worsened until doctors warned him that he would need a double knee replacement. But by combining acupuncture, weight training and a Mediterranean-style diet, he was able to slash his pain level and postpone surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I am now managing amazingly – largely pain-free and back to hiking, swimming, cycling and long walks with my dalmatian Oscar,’ he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say thousands more like Jon could delay or even avoid surgery with simple lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jon Reeves was diagnosed wth osteoarthritis in 2020. By combining acupuncture, weight training and a Mediterranean-style diet, he slashed his pain level and postponed surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The degenerative joint disease affects about ten million Britons. More than half of cases strike the knee, with 100,000 people a year ending up on the NHS waiting list for joint replacement surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Last week, Mail on Sunday columnist Dr Ellie Cannon wrote she was ‘worried that not enough osteoarthritis patients realise there are steps they can take to avoid knee replacement surgery’. In response she had a flood of letters and emails from readers sharing their own remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One, Bill Ellis, 81, from Suffolk, who suffers from osteoarthritis in his knees, said a combination of supplements ‘has certainly made a difference in reducing my pain’ adding: ‘I also do 20 squats every other morning, not too deep I hasten to add, and it keeps the muscles stronger, which helps.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eddie Boyle, 77, from Bedfordshire, swears by capsaicin cream – which contains extracts from chillis – for reducing his pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So from diet swaps to supplements that work and exercises to ease the agony, here is the experts’ guide to managing the pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;1. FOLLOW THE MED DIET &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hailed as a key to longevity, a Mediterranean diet has also been shown to help reduce the symptoms of arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The eating style, common in Greece, Italy and Spain, is focused on fresh fruit and vegetables, fish and chicken, whole grains and olive oil, while cutting back on red meat and sweets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2016 study of more than 4,000 people with osteoarthritis in their knees found those who stuck most closely to the diet were significantly less likely to suffer crippling joint pain. They also scored better on overall physical health and showed fewer signs of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say the diet’s anti-inflammatory properties can help soothe swollen joints, while also protecting heart health and supporting weight control – two key risk factors for arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the Mediterranean diet won’t ‘cure’ osteoarthritis, scientists suggest it offers a simple, natural way to ease symptoms and improve day-to-day well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The Mediterranean diet can be really beneficial for patients,’ says Dr Wendy Holden, medical advisor for Arthritis Action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘A diet rich in fruit and veg as well as fish and whole grains, in addition to cutting down on ultra-processed foods, is key to cutting inflammation.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2016 study of more than 4,000 people with osteoarthritis in their knees found those who stuck most closely to the Mediterranean diet were significantly less likely to suffer crippling joint pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Protein intake is another crucial part of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘From the age of 40 our muscle mass declines by 2 to 3 per cent per year, so we need to take in more protein from different sources in our diet – ideally at least 40 grams daily,’ says Dr Lucy Donaldson, Director of Research at Versus Arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This can be a challenge for many of us, but fortunately our research shows that an essential building block for protein called leucine – found in fish, nuts and legumes – is very potent at stimulating muscle protein levels, helping to maintain skeletal muscle.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other experts argue that the type of diet matters less than weight loss itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The real benefit to any diet, in relation to osteoarthritis symptoms, is maintaining a healthy weight,’ says Professor Philip Conaghan, an arthritis specialist at the University of Leeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This is because it reduces the load on the joints, which in turn eases pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But excess fat also drives inflammation, which makes symptoms worse.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research backs this up. Studies show weight loss reduces levels of inflammatory chemicals released by fat tissue, and can slow cartilage damage even in non-weight-bearing joints such as the hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anecdotally, doctors say patients who shed excess pounds often report less wrist or finger pain – clear evidence the benefits go beyond simply lightening the load on knees and hips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;2. TRY WEIGHT-LOSS JABS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mounting evidence suggests weight-loss injections may ease the pain of osteoarthritis – and in some cases this may be due to more than just losing excess fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For 54-year-old Sian Rios, who suffers from arthritis in her hip, a private prescription for Mounjaro has meant she can finally ditch her walking stick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before starting the jabs, the care home manager from Swindon was in such severe pain she was unable to walk more than a few metres. At night the throbbing pain would wake her repeatedly, leaving her exhausted and sleep-deprived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-e778e500-9bae-11f0-ac66-c563bb30a77b" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15139739/ease-knee-pain-avoid-surgery-six-steps.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;IT'S A FACT&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women are 40 per cent more likely to get knee osteoarthritis than men, with an increase in cases during menopause. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Four months on, she has shed six stone to weigh just over 17st.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I feel like it has given me my life back,’ says Sian. ‘Within weeks of using Mounjaro I was suffering from less pain, but now I very rarely have flare-ups and use pain relief far less often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I have lost a lot of weight since May, but what I have really gained is mobility, confidence and hope. I’ve gone from barely being able to walk to taking strolls around the lake. It’s night and day compared with the start of the year.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her hip replacement scheduled for later this year is now on hold thanks to her progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research backs her experience. A 2025 Taiwanese study of nearly 1,000 patients with osteoarthritis in knees found weight-loss injections reduced the risk of needing joint replacement surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Preliminary studies have suggested there is a benefit to weight-loss injections beyond just weight reduction,’ adds Dr Holden at Arthritis Action. ‘It appears they can help protect cartilage from wear and tear, slowing the progression of disease. The benefits are increasingly being reported by patients, and we are likely to see greater use of the drugs for arthritis going forwards.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, however, arthritis is not included in the prescribing guidelines for weight-loss jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;3. BUILD STRENGTH FIRST&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say the key to managing osteoarthritis pain – and preventing it in the first place – is building strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strictly Come Dancing star Joanne Clifton, 41, who was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in both knees in 2015, is one of those who credits strengthening exercises as preventing her from needing surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Philip Conaghan regularly sees patients aged 40 to 75 with knee, hip or other joint pain, and says muscle weakness is “almost universal”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His advice is simple: ‘First, get strong, then get fit. Just telling people to walk round the block is a bad starting point – because they are weak, they can’t walk at a brisk pace and they’re not getting any benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Strictly Come Dancing star Joanne Clifton, 41, was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in both knees in 2015, and credits strengthening exercises as preventing her from needing surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Once they’ve built some muscle strength, they can start on aerobic fitness, such as on an exercise bike or cross trainer, or swimming. Walking laps in a pool is a fabulous exercise for weak people.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He warns that difficulty undoing a jar, or struggling to get out of a chair or bath, are red flags – even before joint pain sets in – that muscles are weakening and putting too much strain on joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The benefits are clear. A review last year in the Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine concluded there was ‘overwhelming evidence’ that strength training significantly reduces pain and improves function, performance and quality of life in people with knee and hip osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise works because joints depend on the network of muscles and tendons around them. Isaac Selby-Burton, a personal trainer who specialises in arthritis coaching, says: ‘It can be hard for people to take that initial step with exercises, because of the pain the condition causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I recommend starting with resistance bands, focusing on range of motion and muscles like the quads, which are vital for people with knee problems.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;4. USE ACUPUNCTURISTS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients swear by acupuncture to manage osteoarthritis pain, saying it allows them to do the strengthening exercises that bring long-term relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ancient Chinese therapy involves inserting fine needles into specific points in the body, and is said to encourage the release of natural pain-relieving chemicals, improve circulation and reduce stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-08b1d6a0-9baf-11f0-ac66-c563bb30a77b" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15139739/ease-knee-pain-avoid-surgery-six-steps.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;IT'S A FACT&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have found evidence of osteoarthritis in dinosaur fossils, making it one of the oldest known diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The evidence is mixed, but growing. A review in 2025 of 18 studies involving 14,000 people found acupuncture was effective in reducing pain and improving function in osteoarthritis. Other research has shown modest short-term benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘For many people the pain of osteoarthritis has the greatest impact on their lives,’ says Dr Donaldson at Versus Arthritis. ‘Exercise can have very positive effects on pain but isn’t suitable for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Although National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines do not recommend acupuncture for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory forms of arthritis, we know many people living with chronic pain and inflammation use it. Our recent survey on complementary treatments found one in two people who tried acupuncture for arthritis reported some level of pain relief.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;5. USE SUPPLEMENTS THAT WORK&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients often swear by supplements to help ease arthritis pain – but experts say the evidence is thin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the most popular are turmeric (or sometimes just curcumin, the chemical compound that it contains), glucosamine sulphate (which is produced commercially from shellfish exoskeletons) and chondroitin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There is very little evidence to suggest that these supplements will help relieve osteoarthritis,’ says Dr Wendy Holden, medical advisor for Arthritis Action, who is also honorary consultant rheumatologist at Basingstoke and North Hampshire NHS Foundation trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The only two supplements with any evidence behind them are cod liver oil and rosehip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The issue is that although the compounds themselves may have some benefit, supplements don’t usually contain enough of the key ingredient to make a real difference.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only two supplements with any evidence behind them are cod liver oil and rosehip – though even here, results are mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cod liver oil is rich in omega-3 oils, which are thought to have anti-inflammatory effects, but trials in osteoarthritis have generally failed to show clear benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rosehip powder – which is made from the seed pods of a rose bush – has shown more promise, with several small studies and reviews suggesting it can modestly reduce pain and stiffness, though the effects are limited and further research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;6. SPECIALIST BRACES CAN EASE SYMPTOMS &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specialist knee braces can also help to improve osteoarthritis symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2017 study followed 63 patients awaiting total knee replacement who were fitted with an ‘unloading’ or ‘offloading’ brace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After eight years, 40 per cent of those who had worn their brace consistently for two years said they no longer needed surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brace, made of lightweight plastic and fabric, straps around the knee to apply a gentle sideways pull that helps realign the joint. A hinge on the side absorbs some of the downward force, reducing pressure and allowing patients to be more active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients in the trial initially wore the brace almost constantly, before using it selectively for activities needing extra support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who wore it for more than six months were half as likely to require surgery as those who gave up within three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The same model – the Unloader One, made by Icelandic company Ossur – has even been worn by TV star Ant McPartlin, 49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McPartlin revealed he turned to it after his struggle with painkiller addiction following his ‘botched’ knee surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>dailymail.co.uk</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 00:32:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxPOUV4cENOblhOQjNSNWtQRWdtTjVnRFFrS1lXZnJROVRLWnNyV3hsS2F0RnhZSndjcFdPTlZ0RkpGbV9jTExwWTkwdWZVUThLTU42SjlRZ2VxUFhjbVJmQlRWTlZDOEJsc3NSTVpYX0NQTDNUZGswcHBXb3pXM1JHZHR6cndNMEEwMXdGeXByb2FwYVVCRXA3RUtCWQ</guid></item><item><title>N70,000艾滋病预防注射分裂尼日利亚人- Punch报纸</title><link>https://punchng.com/n70000-hiv-prevention-injection-splits-nigerians/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Punch Newspapers</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 00:25:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE55d0RQTWN3YVJ5LURqYVhSQTRYcnVJZS02TmhjTFZ6VHRzbjBNcWdMUnJXV01MOXFrUVcwSTdXY0xnbmFlUUJJakU5SUxhdXM2bVlZV2hCQUJocjIxTTFaVWltOHdLSnZiM0QwdVJENXpBZFJwME9HeA</guid></item><item><title>世界视网膜日：医生说，小习惯在保护你的视力方面每天都有很大的回报-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/world-retina-day-doctors-say-small-habits-pay-off-big-in-protecting-your-vision-daily/articleshow/124183315.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;World Retina Day is all about shining a light on the importance of eye health, specifically the retina, that tiny but mighty part at the back of your eye that makes clear vision possible. Without it, things like reading your favorite book, scrolling on your phone, or even recognizing faces would be a real struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We at TOI spoke to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Yogesh Patil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Vitreo-Retina Surgeon, Dr Agarwals Eye Hospital, Sanpada; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Kalpana R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Senior Consultant, Ophthalmology, SIMS Hospital, Chennai; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Krishna Nagaradh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Vitreo - Retinal Consultant, Dr Agarwals Eye Hospital, Bengaluru on common retinal conditions and how to take care of retinal health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Nutrition for healthy eyes: Here's what doctor recommends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What are the most common retinal conditions you see today, and are cases increasing with lifestyle changes like screen time and diabetes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Yogesh Patil: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age related vision changes are usually gradually progressive like needing reading glasses(presbyopia), scattering of light especially at night, taking longer time to adjust when going from bright to dark places, fluctuating vision. These are normal age related changes which can be treated with glasses, lubricant eye drops or better lighting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if vision changes are sudden in onset, asymmetric or associated with flashes, floaters, distortion or field loss are warning symptoms and are usually associated with Retina diseases. In such conditions an urgent dilated retinal check-up is needed with an expert. If proven Retina disease then it needs certain tests and immediate treatment as time is extremely crucial in these problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Krishna Nagaradh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common retina related conditions seen today are related to diabetes and are known as diabetic retinopathy. Yes the cases are increasing to a greater extent with a sedentary lifestyle which most of the middle-aged people are used to it nowadays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Kalpana R: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common retinal conditions we see today are diabetic retinopathy, age related macular degenerations and Glaucoma and eye stroke. Lifestyle changes like prolonged screen time renders a person obese, enhancing diabetes. Diabetes mellitus could occur familial or secondary due to co-morbidities, bad dietary habits and sedentary lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How can people differentiate between normal age-related vision changes and potential warning signs of retinal diseases?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Yogesh Patil: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prolonged near work and less outdoor time is leading to higher incidence of minus Glasses called “myopia epidemic.” In children, sustained near focus may accelerate myopia progression leading to gradual increase in glass power. Higher minus power (Myopia) increases risk of several problems like retinal tears &amp;amp; detachments and Myopic macular degeneration. Chronic stress and irregular sleep are risk factors for development of central serous chorioretinopathy, a retinal condition more seen in young and middle aged males. Sedentary lifestyle, obesity and low physical activity can lead to early development of diabetic, hypertension and raised cholesterol levels which secondarily leads Diabetic Retinopathy, Retinal vein occlusion like diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Krishna Nagaradh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vision changes due to retinal conditions are usually sudden in onset and are more obvious like appearance of floaters in front of eyes, seeing flashes or beginning to see distorted images, at the same time vision changes related to normal ageing are usually gradual like difficulty in focusing near objects over a period of time like seen in presbyopia or gradual blurring of vision with glare like symptoms seen in cataract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Kalpana R: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal age-related visual changes could be due to receding of reading distance (usually starts in late 30’s or early 40’s) called as presbyopia. Dry eyes causing blurred vision, cataracts causing blurred vision or effective vision. Eye fatigue is common after straining. People cannot differentiate between the normal aging of the eyes and vision disturbances due to retinal diseases unless they become severe and cause a significant amount of vision loss. Hence, regular eye check-ups are mandatory to identify and treat them at the earliest. Retinal diseases symptoms are such as seeing floaters, flashes, loss of vision, loss of central vision, and loss of peripheral vision. Individuals should be mindful that before these symptoms occur a significant amount of retina is affected beyond repair in certain conditions like diabetes, degenerative diseases, glaucoma., etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;We hear a lot about diabetic retinopathy—how big of a public health concern is it right now?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Yogesh Patil:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currently India has the second-largest diabetic population in the world and Diabetic Retinopathy is the most common cause of vision loss in working-age adults worldwide. Approximately in India there are 12 million people suffering from Diabetic Retinopathy and 20% of these have variable degree of permanent vision loss. The worst part of Diabetic Retinopathy is no pain, very few subtle symptoms in early stages and by the time patients present with complaints its already advanced stage with some amount of permanent vision loss. Advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy require expensive treatments like lasers, intravitreal injections, surgery). The good news is up to 90% of vision loss from DR can be prevented with timely screening, sugar control and early treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Krishna Nagaradh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the middle aged population. Globally there were 12 crore people suffering from diabetic retinopathy in 2010 and this number can reach upto 20 crores by 2030. Diabetic retinopathy has the potential to cause blindness and with increasing prevalence of diabetes worldwide makes this condition a bigger public health condition which has to to be taken seriously and people should get screened so that the patients are diagnosed early and treated to prevent major vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Kalpana R: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetic retinopathy is of major concern in today’s world since the number of cases are increasing despite awareness. It’s a condition which affects the retinal blood vessels and in turn affects the layers of the retina at different stages causing blindness if not treated at the earliest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What role does early detection play in preventing severe vision loss from conditions like macular degeneration or retinal detachment?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Yogesh Patil: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macular degeneration and retinal detachment are two separate diseases but if detected early treatment is simpler and more vision rewarding in both. In case of retinal detachment early detection involves screening for flashes and floaters, detecting peripheral Retinal degeneration/tears which can easily be treated with a quick outpatient laser via major surgery for retinal detachment. Early detection of dry macular degeneration means patients can start lifestyle changes (diet rich in antioxidants, stopping smoking, supplements in select cases) and monitoring which can slow progression of condition to more devastating disease like Wet Macular degeneration. Even in wet age related macular degeneration: If detected early, intravitreal anti-VEGF injections can preserve reading and driving vision whereas detected late (scarred macula), even the best treatment cannot restore useful central vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Krishna Nagaradh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection is crucial in treating any of the retinal conditions as we can minimise the damage caused to the retina and slow the disease progression which in turn preserves the vision. In treating retinal detachment intervention done in hours to days of time will restore maximum vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Kalpana R: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ingemination to prevent peripheral vision loss due to retinal diseases is a regular eye check up with an ophthalmologist (not optical) and following the investigations and treatment protocols suggested by the doctor without fail. The amount of retinal cells lost in the inadvertence cannot be reverted. All the attempts are to retain the viable tissue for a prolonged period to give some amount of quality of life to the patient. Retinal detachment is realized early by the patient (which is possible by noticing loss of vision suddenly or gradually, floaters and flashes) can be treated well and there is a possibility of patients getting a good quality of vision post-surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How important is diet and lifestyle in protecting retinal health, and what simple habits can people adopt?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Yogesh Patil: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have already discussed the role of bad lifestyle/ diet results in several retina diseases. Now let's see what rectification should be done. In terms of diets, foods rich in antioxidants (green leafy vegetables, coloured fruits) and Omega 3 fatty acids( nuts, chia seeds, fish) should be a regular part of one’s diet. Restrict refined sugars, processed food, alcohol and tobacco / smoking, regular exercise improves blood flow, lowers risk of diabetes &amp;amp; hypertension. Annual/ regular eye check-ups especially in diabetic, hypertensive or highly myopic. Balanced screen use and encourages outdoor activity in children to reduce myopia progression. Stress &amp;amp; sleep management - lowers risk of CSCR and helps overall vascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Krishna Nagaradh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diets rich in anti oxidants like vitamin A,C,E zinc, lutein and zeaxanthin play a vital role in protecting the retina. They are found in abundance in green leafy vegetables. Also foods like fruits and vegetables support the overall functioning of the eyes. To quit smoking is another major lifestyle modification needed to be adopted as it will reduce the oxidative stress over the retina and prevent its damage. Managing blood sugar and blood pressure levels. Protection of once eyes from harmful UV radiations by using protective glasses, keeping self hydrated, reducing screen time, getting enough sleep and avoiding frequent touching of eyes also plays role in maintaining eye health. Regular eye checkups which should include dilated eye examination for early detection of retinal pathology will avoid severe vision damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="101"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Kalpana R: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A well-balanced diet is the most important requirement for healthy eyes. Fruits, nuts, green vegetables are all essential for the function of the retina which carries the electrical impulses to the brain which is converted as an image for us to see. Without balanced nutrition the retina degenerates faster. A proper lifestyle is the quintessence of healthy eyes. Cutting down on screen time, having adequate amount of sleep, using the gadgets at a proper distance (60-70cm away) with anti-reflective screen, avoiding reading in dim lights or glaring lights, following the 20/20/20 rule which is only 20 minutes of attention to gadgets at a stretch, blinking every 20 seconds, and looking at objects 20 meters away; this is of utmost importance to prevent dry eyes and eye strain while working. Well balanced nutrition is mandatory, avoiding eye injuries (wearing protective goggles at necessary times) should be borne in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="108"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What’s one myth about retinal health you wish more people understood correctly?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="110"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Yogesh Patil: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People think that if their vision is good, their retina must be healthy. The truth is early retinal diseases are usually silent. Good vision does not equal a healthy retina. The only way to know is through a regular dilated retinal exam or imaging specially in at risk people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="114"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Krishna Nagaradh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major myth which I have heard from many of my patients is that eye check ups need to be done only when they face a difficulty in vision. Regular eye checkups are must especially in diabetics cause early diagnosis and treatment can avoid major eye related complications in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="117"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Kalpana R: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common myth about absent retinal diseases is that they can be cured at any time. But the fact is in some individuals the worst outcome can be averted while in some it can be prolonged. Take good care of your eyes and see the colors of the world with a Duchenne smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="122"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This day is a reminder to check in on your eye health, because conditions like macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal detachment can sneak up without obvious symptoms at first. Regular eye exams are key. A quick visit can help catch problems early and protect your sight long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="124"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just about doctor visits, your lifestyle plays a role too. Eating foods rich in antioxidants (think leafy greens, berries, and fish packed with omega-3s), wearing sunglasses to block UV rays, and keeping your blood sugar and blood pressure in check all support retinal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="126"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, on World Retina Day, give your eyes some love. Schedule that eye exam, grab a pair of good shades, and maybe even swap the fries for a salad, it’s a small step with a big payoff for your vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="128"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 23:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>随着卡车驶入数百万只死鸡的潜在垃圾场，巴尔米拉社区感到震惊- TMJ4新闻</title><link>https://www.tmj4.com/news/jefferson-county/palmyra-community-alarmed-as-trucks-pull-into-potential-dump-site-for-millions-of-dead-chickens</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PALMYRA, Wis. — After TMJ4's &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.tmj4.com/news/jefferson-county/palmyra-neighbors-brace-for-second-mass-chicken-disposal-as-bird-flu-strikes-jefferson-county"&gt;initial story&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, the Palmyra community in Jefferson County reached out to the news team concerned about the smell of millions of dead chickens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://datcp.wi.gov/Pages/Highly-Pathogenic-Avian-Influenza-Confirmed-in-Jefferson-County.aspx"&gt;Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection&lt;/a&gt;, a commercial flock of chickens were slaughtered after a case of bird flu was discovered in the county.

The 33-year-old began using it after a "traumatic year" in 2024. Her son was born prematurely, and as a result of stress, the mother-of-three says her skin took a "huge hit".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;She uses marine collagen, the type derived from fish, in a tropical-flavoured gel she drinks every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"My skin definitely seems to be brighter and clearer, plus my hair has never looked better since I started taking it," Kimberlie says. "As a sleep deprived mother, it's definitely made a difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Emma Wedgeworth, a consultant dermatologist based on London's Harley Street, says while there is some &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b05679" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;research to suggest taking collagen orally has an impact&lt;/a&gt;, she remains sceptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;She says the idea that collagen can make its journey through our body - not the easiest of quests - and land exactly where we need it to be is probably wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For a start, it has to get through the gut without being completely broken down. Collagen is a large molecule so companies have now started to break it up into smaller pieces - collagen peptides - otherwise known as hydrolysed collagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Even though this collagen - now in its smaller form - has a better chance of making its way through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream, it still has a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It has to reach the skin to have an impact, and it could just as easily slip off to support other organs in the body. It's a valuable resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"There is little reliable evidence on this, but there is a theory that because our skin is the organ with the 'fastest turnover' of cells, it might be more likely to use these collagen peptides above other organs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;And that's when you might get an increase in collagen being made in the skin cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;'You can't risk stopping'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;That all seems very complicated - and uncertain. It may leave you asking: what about using collagen creams? They're going directly onto the skin, so won't they stand more chance of getting where they need to be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"No," is Ms Wedgworth's simple answer. "The collagen will just sit on the outer layer of your skin, it won't reach the dermis - which is the middle layer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;There are three different types of collagen supplements: marine (from fish), bovine (from cows), and vegan. Of the three, the dermatologist recommends marine if you are taking collagen orally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This is because it contains more type 1 collagen - the most common of the five types and the one that gives structure to our skin cells, as well as playing a crucial role in the health of our bones, tendons and connective tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Vegan collagen is the least effective, says Ms Wedgeworth. Collagen is an animal-derived protein, so these products are not actually made of collagen, and instead contain a range of amino acids and vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Matthew Montgomery Ali Watson at the gym, smiling at the camera and rubbing chalk on her hands

He lifts an eyebrow in acknowledgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Ali, a neuroanaesthetist who, by her own admission, "knows a lot about dosing", feels like now she's started taking collagen, she can't stop - and nor can she stop giving it to her dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I started taking it as a powder a couple of years ago.

And he is a bit brighter, but that might just be because the weather's got colder again and he's less hot and lethargic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Ali's not completely convinced the supplement is making a difference, and it's costing her £60 a month to ensure she and Tommy get their daily dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Tommy started on collagen a few months ago to help his joints&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But she says she now can't stop dosing them both up. "That's the thing with these supplements," the 46-year-old says, "life does have its ups and downs. You might take them when you're on a down, then things pick up again - and it might have very little to do with the supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"But by that stage, you can't risk stopping."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Professor Faisal Ali, a consultant dermatologist at Mid Cheshire NHS Trust, says one of the issues consumers and clinicians face is the amount of conflicting information and conflicting interests in supplement research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;A recent, relatively small, study compared &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934325002839" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;research funded by the wellness industry&lt;/a&gt; to studies that did not have the same conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;While industry-funded studies suggested collagen supplements significantly improved skin hydration, elasticity and wrinkles, those that did not receive funding from pharmaceutical companies revealed no effect on skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Prof Ali says industry-funded studies are not "inherently bad", it's just such a varied picture. But he says there is a lack of robust evidence to suggest oral and topical collagen have any substantial effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;So if I could turn back time and start drinking and banking collagen in my 20s, would I have smoother, more youthful skin now, I ask him? Probably not, he says. It doesn't stay in the body for that long - we haven't got a collagen store cupboard that we can just dip into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Micro derma facial roller" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Microneedling makes small wounds in the skin which may trigger collagen production&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, Prof Ali believes we can potentially boost collagen output and maintain elasticity in our skin by using special techniques&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11499218/#fn-group1" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt; such as laser collagen stimulation and microneedling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This means using a number of tiny, specialist needles or a laser to make small wounds to our skin, which then encourage a repair process, triggering new collagen formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But that's not cheap.

The other three infants were completely unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s&gt;The rabbis' letter represents a clear halakhic statement from the Chief Rabbinate, emphasizing that vaccination is not only a right but a religious duty. The message is particularly aimed at communities where there is resistance to vaccines for religious or other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s&gt;Meanwhile, the Health Ministry has warned that measles continues to spread, encouraging the public to vaccinate, especially children and communities with low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="z396inn" class="" data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding out you’ve inherited a life-changing illness is devastating enough, but realizing the people who should have warned you chose to stay silent cuts even deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mm-player"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what would you do if your parents knowingly hid a hereditary disease that not only put your own life at risk but also your child’s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you let them keep their secret to avoid tearing the family apart? Or would you inform the other members of your family?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g5o3dh/aita_for_calling_my_parents_selfish_for_having_me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;following story&lt;/a&gt;, one daughter faces this exact decision and feels everyone has the right to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;AITA for calling my parents selfish for having me, knowing they’d pass down a hereditary illness, and going LC after they hid it, putting my child at risk too?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I (28F) recently found out I have a serious hereditary illness that’s going to mess up my life, and I am so mad I can barely type this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a degenerative illness, no cure, nothing. My body’s just gonna slowly get worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the kicker? My parents have known this could happen my whole life and never said a word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This illness runs in my family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of her family members have the same illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My dad’s mom had it. His sister—my aunt—died from it a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was living overseas when she passed, and my parents told me it was cancer. Cancer. They lied right to my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until I got diagnosed that they finally came clean and admitted she had the same illness I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I confronted them, my dad wouldn’t even give me a straight answer. I asked if he had it too, and he dodged every single question, acting like I was overreacting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s where things took a turn for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mom, on the other hand, tried to justify it by saying they didn’t want me “living in fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you kidding me? I could have been prepared! Instead, they chose to let me walk into this blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s where it gets worse—I have a 2-year-old son. My child might have this, and they never told me I was at risk. I could’ve had him tested, made informed decisions, anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no, they took that from me, and now I live in constant fear for him, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then my mom had the nerve to ask me if I would rather not have been born than deal with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you believe that? She turned it around on me, like I’m the monster for even thinking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how she responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you know what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I said it. Yes, I would rather not have been born than deal with this disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They made a selfish choice, and now I’m paying for it. They knew the risks and did it anyway, for themselves. They wanted kids, and now I’m stuck with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called them selfish, and I meant every word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, they want her to stay quiet, but she can’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, they’re begging me not to tell my younger siblings. They don’t know about this yet, haven’t been tested, and my parents want to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re hoping they’ll get lucky, but I’m not going to lie to them. I refuse to let them be blindsided like I was. They deserve to know the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve gone low-contact with my parents. I can’t stand to even think about them right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guilt trips won’t stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mom keeps trying to guilt-trip me, saying they were “just trying to protect me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protect me from what? The truth? No, they weren’t protecting me. They were protecting themselves from the guilt of knowing they passed this on, and now they want me to protect them, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I won’t. I love my son and my siblings too much to lie to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AITA?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! It’s easy to see both sides of this, but the parents should’ve seen it coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see what the fine folks over at Reddit have to say about this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person’s family also deals with a hereditary disease.&lt;/p&gt;

First and foremost, for anyone who's 6 months old and above, there are zero safety concerns about the COVID vaccine. We are recommending that everyone 6 months and above get an updated COVID shot this fall to protect them as much as possible for the upcoming respiratory viral season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="47rba"&gt;There are a few groups that we are really strongly encouraging to get vaccinated: People who are above the age of 65 and anyone who is pregnant or considering being pregnant. And we're also encouraging our babies, the age group of 6 months to 24 months. Those groups in particular will benefit tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="1ik7l"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Centers for Disease Control’s Vaccine Advisory Board is recommending that people consult with their doctor before getting a coronavirus shot. That is a shift from previous federal policy that made vaccines widely available to almost all Americans older than 6 months for free and without question. What does it mean to consult with a clinician?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1tge1"&gt;Unless you have a special or unique medical situation that requires you to have further consultation with your physician, there is no need for consultation. For the COVID vaccine, specifically, I want to underline again that there has been no new data presented about any safety concerns about the COVID vaccine. Again, my recommendation and the city's recommendation, in partnership with New York State health commissioner, is that those 6 months and over should go ahead and get that vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5c4d4"&gt;I do worry that the very confusing messaging that is coming from our vaccination advisory council at the CDC, as well as the current U.S. health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., are going to make people confused and concerned. We are in a position to say very, very clearly that it is recommended that New Yorkers 6 months old and above get the updated COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="cheq4"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can New Yorkers get the vaccine at a pharmacy? Do they need to get a prescription for it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3p0i6"&gt;Luckily, because of action by Gov. Kathy Hochul and the executive order that she signed a couple of weeks ago, New Yorkers do not need a prescription. In fact, the New York City Health Department just relaunched our New York City health map — &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/index.page" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;nyc.gov/health&lt;/a&gt; — with updated information about where you can get the COVID vaccine. It lists not only geographically lists any specific community you're in, it also lists by insurance. We also list a number of places where you can go if you do not have insurance or you can't afford to pay for a vaccine, a COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="5rh49"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now, this summer it seemed like a lot of people were getting sick with COVID, and according to the City Health Department COVID data, there was a steady increase of known COVID cases in August. So, if someone recently had COVID, do they still need to get a vaccine?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="96eev"&gt;In recent weeks we did see a slight uptick in both emergency room visits and hospitalizations for COVID, and we still see that uptick actually for people who are very young and for people over the age of 65. So, COVID is definitely out there and circulating. The evidence suggests that if you just had COVID, it is generally recommended that you wait around three months, at least, after your episode of COVID to get the vaccine. But really you are eligible to get the vaccine really anytime after you're no longer feeling ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dcri7"&gt;And if you have more questions about that, you can certainly also talk to your primary care doctor about what the ideal timing is for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="7brpi"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about insurance? Does that cover the vaccine?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6u6i9"&gt;We are also very excited to be able to say that all of the insurers across New York City and New York State have agreed to make sure that the COVID vaccine is covered by health insurance. That is incredibly important because no one should have to pay for vaccines. Vaccines are safe and effective. They benefit you and your community and your family. And in many cases they are lifesaving, as we learned very clearly during the height of the emergency phase of the COVID pandemic. Unfortunately last flu season was also one of our worst flu seasons in recent history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dgfo3"&gt;RSV is also circulating. So we want there to be as few barriers as possible to people getting their respiratory viral vaccines. We do have those guarantees from insurers that those vaccines will be covered. It is right about the perfect time for everyone listening to go ahead and get out there and get your COVID flu and RSV vaccine if you're eligible for RSV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="6h0s7"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What if somebody doesn't have insurance? What recourse do they have?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dt98g"&gt;At the City Health Department, part of what we do is, we ensure that no matter if you can pay, no matter where you live, no matter your documentation status, no matter any of those things, we want to make sure that you have access to lifesaving vaccines and healthcare. The NYC Health map lists several places here you can get these vaccines for respiratory viral season, even if you do not health insurance and are unable to pay out of pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="arj7s"&gt;&lt;b&gt;We've talked about the guidance from the federal government and how some people might be confused about new recommendations as it relates to vaccines. As a local city health official, how do you take what's being said from the federal government and then shape vaccine policy here in New York City?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="b6aii"&gt;This is one of our greatest challenges right now. Under normal circumstances, the federal government and the CDC are our partners in really making sure that accurate information is out there in the public. That is not the case right now, and that is incredibly challenging for us. So part of what we do and, and what we will continue to do, no matter what happens at the federal level, is push out information through our social media channels, through talking on the radio with folks like you, Sean, through videos and, and all kinds of different communication approaches to make sure that the message is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="234oc"&gt;Again, respiratory viral season is here. It’s time to get your COVID flu and RSV vaccine if you're eligible. They are safe and effective. That has not changed. And we will do our very best to make sure that those vaccines are free and accessible for everyone who's ready to get them, especially for the groups that are at highest risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="eofnh"&gt;&lt;b&gt;That's New York City Health Commissioner, Dr. Michelle Morse. Commissioner, as always, thanks for joining us.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dtqe5"&gt;Thanks for having me, Sean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 20:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPY3JtMThCM0JNY2M1TVZWS3V0aVdYLTZrZFMwRnJIZ3Q1c2JvbUhpcmtodE1nT1BQOEVQNFpGejNQWlRwWlRHWHVYRDZfUG1qZGZXT1BleXl3RUFBSzFWc0s2aXFuMU9kNzloeTNSYXNsUldyM0h1NUpIVGt0b2FkcHJMNi1ZSFk</guid></item><item><title>在奥斯威戈县废水中检测到麻疹，州警告- Syracuse.com</title><link>https://www.syracuse.com/news/2025/09/measles-detected-in-oswego-county-wastewater-state-warns.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AOTFJF5VF5BMRGUMEXWVKHM26E"&gt;Oswego, N.Y. - Low levels of the measles virus were detected in a wastewater sample collected earlier this week from an Oswego County treatment facility, according to the state Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BNK7A34GXJD3RBUGVYAVSO2SZI"&gt;The treatment facility serves parts of the City of Oswego and surrounding areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HCEWM5UFRBHCTGQLCHVW5R43TM"&gt;The results may indicate that at least one person with the virus was in the county, according to a news release issued Saturday by the health department.
