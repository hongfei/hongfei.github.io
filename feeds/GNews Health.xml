&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🚀 The U.S. Space Force and Gravitics are developing an orbital aircraft carrier to transform &lt;strong&gt;satellite deployment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔒 The carrier offers an unpressurized environment to protect &lt;strong&gt;sensitive electronics&lt;/strong&gt; from harsh space conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🤝 Public-private partnerships are crucial for advancing U.S. &lt;strong&gt;space superiority&lt;/strong&gt; and integrating new technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌌 This initiative marks a new era in &lt;strong&gt;space exploration&lt;/strong&gt;, impacting security and international relations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States is making significant strides in space technology through an ambitious project that aims to transform satellite deployment. The cornerstone of this initiative is the creation of an orbital aircraft carrier by the innovative startup Gravitics. This development underscores the U.S.’s strategic commitment to maintaining space as a pivotal domain and highlights the growing collaboration between private companies and national defense agencies. As global tensions rise, the United States is taking decisive steps to ensure its dominance and secure its presence in the increasingly competitive space sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Vision Behind the Orbital Aircraft Carrier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the U.S. Space Force, Gravitics is leading a bold $60 million project to develop an orbital aircraft carrier aimed at revolutionizing satellite deployment. This cutting-edge platform will enable the direct launch of satellites from Earth’s orbit, offering a quicker and more flexible response to national security challenges. By eliminating the need for traditional rocket launches, this approach provides a significant strategic advantage for military operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orbital carrier initiative aligns with the U.S. military’s goal of maintaining a strong orbital presence amid the potential for a space arms race. With a pre-positioned platform in orbit, the United States can deploy satellites as needed, addressing both immediate and long-term security issues. This advancement in space technology reaffirms the United States’ dedication to leading in this critical domain, positioning itself at the forefront of global space capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OLVC7zeKgL"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.energy-reporters.com/news/china-unveils-fighter-sized-combat-drone-beijing-parades-autonomous-war-machine-that-matches-j-10-fighter-performance-while-us-falls-behind-in-unmanned-air-superiority-race/"&gt;“China Unveils Fighter-Sized Combat Drone”: Beijing Parades Autonomous War Machine That Matches J-10 Fighter Performance While US Falls Behind In Unmanned Air Superiority Race&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enhancing Space Security and Superiority&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gravitics’s orbital aircraft carrier is designed to house multiple satellites in an unpressurized environment, safeguarding them from the severe conditions of space. This protection of sensitive electronics and batteries is vital in an era characterized by electronic warfare and cyber threats. By isolating and shielding satellites, the United States gains a strategic advantage in enhancing its space security capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the carrier’s ability to conceal satellites from adversaries provides a tactical edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SgPrHC3UYw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.energy-reporters.com/news/russias-terrifying-2500-high-precision-missiles-production-plan-triggers-natos-worst-nightmare-for-2025-military-escalation/"&gt;Russia’s Terrifying 2,500 High-Precision Missiles Production Plan Triggers NATO’s Worst Nightmare for 2025 Military Escalation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gravitics CEO Colin Doughan describes the carrier as a “game-changer” that aligns perfectly with the Space Force’s mission of achieving orbital dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project not only strengthens military capabilities but also sets a precedent for future technological advancements in space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Y7cPwE3R0Z"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.energy-reporters.com/news/this-revolutionary-249-mph-cruising-speed-train-cuts-weight-10-and-resistance-22-through-aerodynamic-engineering/"&gt;This Revolutionary 249 MPH Cruising Speed Train Cuts Weight 10% and Resistance 22% Through Aerodynamic Engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Public-Private Partnerships and Their Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of the orbital aircraft carrier exemplifies the increasing importance of public-private partnerships in the space industry. Gravitics, along with Axiom Space, is also developing a pressurized space module, demonstrating its commitment to both national defense and commercial solutions. This dual approach underscores Gravitics’s alignment with the Department of Defense’s objectives and its growth trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborations between private companies and government entities are essential for integrating innovative technologies into national defense strategies. By working together, these partnerships strengthen the U.S.’s position in space while fostering the development of technologies with potential civilian applications. The success of these collaborations could open new market opportunities and further advancements in space technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Future of Space Exploration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advent of technologies like the orbital aircraft carrier, a new era of space exploration and utilization is on the horizon. This technological breakthrough has the potential to transform security, surveillance, and communication paradigms, impacting both military operations and private sector involvement. The implications are vast, signaling a shift in how space is utilized and governed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the U.S. Space Force and companies like Gravitics prepare for future challenges, questions about international space cooperation arise. How will these innovations affect diplomatic relations between nations? More importantly, how can we ensure that space remains a domain of shared peace and progress, benefiting all of humanity?&lt;/p&gt;

Mike Brandt, 29, had left their small three-bedroom house in Center Barnstead, New Hampshire, a few hours earlier. He was supposedly meeting a client about his web design business – a side hustle from his high-school teaching job. Katie, also 29, thought this was a lie, but let &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;it go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie feared the knock meant trouble – or worse, that her husband was dead. She remembers the officer saying: ‘We’ve clocked your husband going &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;90 miles&lt;/span&gt; an hour, and we can’t catch him. He stopped at Cumberland Farms, bought beer, urinated on the side of the building, and &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;took off.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes later, Mike pulled into the driveway, nearly hitting the deck. The officer coolly watched from the door as Mike, a hulking &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;6’ 3”,&lt;/span&gt; stumbled out of the car reeking of vomit, then threw up on the pavement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie didn’t know what to think. His strange behaviour had started during her first trimester of pregnancy, &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;11 months&lt;/span&gt; before that visit from the police. She noticed something was off – Mike didn’t share her excitement about the baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, she brushed off his indifference as marital, like being ignored by a spouse glued to the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there were the weird moments: the earbuds he refused to remove during her labour, lost in a &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; audiobook while she gave birth; the strange obsession with sweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Mike quit his teaching job, ostensibly to grow his web design business. But when she checked his phone, she found a slew of unanswered messages from angry customers. His designs, once beautiful, had turned chaotic with ugly fonts and bizarre layouts. Worse, he didn’t seem to notice the drop in quality or care about his upset clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were smaller, stranger things: he started licking food off his fingers at dinner. He stopped brushing his teeth and let his beard grow wild. These weren’t just quirks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, it was the police incident that marked the end of the early days of Mike’s illness, when she could still recall how it had been before the intimacy between them was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘It was like he was drifting far away,’ Katie said. ‘And I couldn’t &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;reach him.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Photo courtesy of Katie Brandt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hen I met Katie, 45, at Tatte Bakery &amp;amp; Café in Brookline, Massachusetts, she had just finished a long afternoon on Beacon Hill, reciting her elevator pitch to state senators. She arrived for our meeting put together, in business casual, slightly weary from repeating her story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie is tall and lanky with a big, toothy smile. Her voice is warm and even, the kind that draws people in. She greeted me with practised calm, coffee in hand, then pulled up a chair and leaned in close to hear better over the din of voices in the bakery. We fell back into the conversation we had been unspooling for months – about caregivers and the systems that fail to support them, about the meaning of loving someone through cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had already met each other through a webinar we had co-hosted on family caregiving. She spoke as a national advocate for dementia care; I, as a palliative care physician and consultant to the National Center for Equitable Care for Elders. But I wanted to take our conversation beyond titles and talking points. I wanted to learn how she’d transformed her life, following the slow, devastating unravelling of her husband by a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disease, into a career shaping support structures for others. A path that led her to a position as the director of Caregiver Support Services at the renowned Frontotemporal Disorders Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;She’d suspected all along that ‘something was terribly wrong’ while the doctors shrugged&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie never sugarcoats her story. She replayed the timeline of events from &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;12 years&lt;/span&gt; ago, which had followed Mike’s diagnosis, at 31, with frontotemporal dementia – an illness that slowly erodes personality, judgment and emotional awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘It had been two years of misdiagnoses before a doctor finally listened,’ Katie said. She’d suspected all along that ‘something was terribly wrong’ while the doctors shrugged. Depression, they said. Stress. Marriage problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a doctor diagnosed him with severe depression, the medications they prescribed made him sleepy and even more disconnected. She insisted that his psychiatrist order a scan of his brain. ‘Could he have a brain tumour?’ she asked. She remembers attempting to explain to the doctor the reasons for her concerns. But how do you explain that someone’s personality has vanished – when that person doesn’t even notice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one listened. Not Mike. Not the doctors. And, as it turned out, that scan was the wrong kind to show signs of frontotemporal dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Mike tried to fix their washing machine with a butane torch, she knew something needed to change, and fast. Desperate, Katie brought Mike to her father’s doctor, a neurologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie coaxed Mike into the exam room with strategies that she had honed over the past year and a half. She never commanded him; instead, she made gentle suggestions like: ‘Let’s sit here. The chairs look comfortable.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t long before Mike stopped the interview, shortly after the doctor asked him to name words starting with the letter ‘F’. ‘Fuck!’ Mike yelled and abruptly left the exam room. Katie was left behind, stunned and alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘It’s bad,’ the doctor said to Katie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;ot long ago, I spoke with the neurologist Brad Dickerson, Katie’s boss, about why frontotemporal dementia is difficult to diagnose. Dickerson is the director of the Frontotemporal Disorders Unit at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He sees patients referred by other doctors, often to confirm a diagnosis or, in some cases, to unwind years of misdiagnoses. His kind manner and trust-inducing smile come across even on a Zoom call – the kind of doctor you’d want. But his expertise lies in frontotemporal dementia, a fatal disease that progresses over time, as short as three years or as long as 12. Frontotemporal dementia has no cure and no proven treatments to slow its progression. In that sense, he is the kind of doctor you hope you’ll never need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;15 per&lt;/span&gt; cent of cases of frontotemporal disorder are inherited, leaving the remaining &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;85 per&lt;/span&gt; cent without a clear cause, according to Dickerson. He studies the familial forms of the disease. The hope is that knowing where to ‘shoot the arrow’ will help researchers develop targeted treatments for people with the inherited version, and suggest medical strategies for the unknown or sporadic types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘We’re on the brink of personalised medicine for FTD – treatments tailored to fit a person’s unique biology,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;When executive functioning is lost, a person may become disorganised, inflexible or impulsive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask him to explain frontotemporal disorders, and he begins with a taxonomy lesson, categorising different symptoms of the disease according to which lobe of the brain they begin in – either the frontal lobes located directly behind the forehead or the temporal lobes that sit behind the ears, like a set of headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike had ‘behavioural variant’ frontotemporal dementia that began in the right side of the frontal lobe, according to his medical records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the disease gets worse, the frontal lobes slowly atrophy (or shrink), and circuitry to other parts of the brain becomes faulty as they clog with abnormal proteins. This disrupts cognitive processes such as executive functioning, which helps us plan, organise and pay attention. When executive functioning is lost, a person may become disorganised, inflexible or impulsive. Atrophying frontal lobes may also trigger repetitive behaviours – like incessant listening to &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; audiobooks – or obsessions such as an unstoppable desire to eat sweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike’s loss of interest in the world of Katie and their son tracks to a loss of metacognition or insight. Metacognition – our sixth sense – lights up the dark road ahead, helping us assess danger. It’s our inner mother warning us ‘Don’t do it.’ A decline in metacognition can lead to a fading of our emotional and social engagement and our ability to see others outside of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie sees the loss of partnership, when we are no longer being &lt;em&gt;seen &lt;/em&gt;by our special other, as the core disaster of frontotemporal dementia for families. Her work with caregivers, she tells me, recasts their role from invisible player to the ‘star in their own epic tale’, with ‘being there’ as the ultimate expression of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;‘They don’t forget things like an Alzheimer’s patient would – but their personality is completely different’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontotemporal dementia is still widely misunderstood, even among medical professionals. One cause of diagnostic confusion is that the early symptoms of Alzheimer’s dementia – the most common cause of dementia in older adults – are different from frontotemporal dementia. Alzheimer’s usually begins in the back regions of the brain, with the first signs often emerging as memory and word-finding problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘With FTD, they don’t forget things like an Alzheimer’s patient would – but their personality is completely different,’ Dickerson said. He added: ‘FTD doesn’t fit the textbook definition of dementia that most doctors learned in medical school.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the diagnostic misadventures experienced by patients and families, he observes, are due to the use of screening tests that are structured to identify the memory loss seen in Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In frontotemporal dementia, memory is preserved, at least in the early and middle stages of the illness: patients might be able to master a crossword puzzle but refuse to stop working on it to help prepare the family dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the full story, he interviews the patient and an ‘informant’, usually a family member, partner or close friend, since they are most likely to notice uncharacteristic behaviours as signs of something amiss. Without this perspective, the chances of missing a brewing frontotemporal disorder are high, as the patient, due to deteriorating metacognition, will tell you that ‘everything is fine.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;K&lt;/span&gt;atie was close to her mother, Diane.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;They spoke on the phone every day. She became a sanctuary for Katie, now a mother herself, as Mike’s interest in fatherhood slipped away. The day Katie received the news about Mike’s diagnosis, her parents were there, sitting in the doctor’s waiting room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie remembers that day as the last time she saw her mother. She watched her parents step into the elevator down to the lobby as she followed Mike on his preferred route, the stairs. Four days later, her mother died in her sleep of a heart attack &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;at 58.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her mother’s death was the moment Katie realised there was no return to life as it had been. She would have to figure out her own life first, if she was going to support Mike through what lay ahead. With her mother gone, she left her job in New Hampshire and moved in with her father, newly diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, in Massachusetts. In the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, her home in Center Barnstead went into foreclosure, making it unsellable. She also lost her health insurance, which she had through Mike’s job. In the following months, Katie was swallowed by a bureaucratic vortex of securing medical insurance for her child and Mike. She applied for food assistance for the baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;‘This horrible thing happened to me, and the world just kept turning, like it didn’t matter’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Mike died at 33, Katie had already begun shaping her grief into something structured. At rock bottom, she began to build. In the summer of 2012, a few months after he died, Katie started volunteering for the Boston-based arm of the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration. That role evolved into leading a support group and providing community education. In 2018, this work turned into a position at Mass General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Katie about how she was doing after years of caregiving, for Mike and then for her father, all while raising a child on her own. Why step back into the breach of dementia caregiving, this time as an advocate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘At first, the work was about finding my voice after years of isolation and loneliness,’ she replied. ‘This horrible thing happened to me, and the world just kept turning, like it didn’t matter.’ She wanted to tell her story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then it became about diving in, learning everything she could about how to help families living with dementia caregiving. ‘Some people want to leave a caregiving experience in the past,’ she said. Katie, meanwhile, wanted to fight, and pay things forward.&lt;/p&gt;

Courtesy the author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;K&lt;/span&gt;atie’s work at Mass General is a mix of science communication, systems navigation and pastoral care. She lectures to national groups about family caregiving, sometimes to audiences as big as 1,000. She trains clinicians. She moderates forums where caregivers get to say out loud: ‘This sucks.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘When caregivers are part of our programme, they don’t need to Google to get answers,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also sits on advisory panels trying to improve the caregiver experience: fighting for supports and recognition, and for more rigorous training for neurologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie is unapologetic. She knows the story of Mike’s illness is compelling, and has learned to use it to bring attention to the caregivers behind the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I know we have to wait for science to cure Alzheimer’s and other dementias, but public policy and money could fix the problems that caregivers are afflicted by now,’ she &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;told me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;He tumbled down the stairs and lay on the floor, only to see his wife step over him to ‘top off her coffee’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the Older Americans Act was reauthorised by Congress and included, for the first time, provisions that allowed patients under 60 with dementia to access support programmes that they previously were locked out of because of age. Katie was co-chair of the National Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA), which pushed this legislation forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She thinks that this updated law is game-changing for caregivers of patients with early onset dementias, and wonders how different things would have been for her if Mike had had access to caregiver services – and also for her father, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;at 58.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie invited me to sit in on a Zoom support group for caregivers of people with frontotemporal dementia. She routinely allows clinicians to sit in as learners, encouraging members to be the teachers, in a role-reversal. ‘It helps some of them find meaning to their experiences to share this way,’ Katie said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group, the largest of its kind in the country, is co-led by Katie and a colleague from Mass General. I watched Katie navigate the meeting with the calm of a pilot in the midst of an emergency landing, as members toggled between laughter and despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘If you want to know what they’re up against,’ she said, ‘listen to the caregivers!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark humour abounded as some recounted their bleakest moments of the ‘journey’, as many seasoned caregivers referred to it. One gentleman described how his wife ‘lost her nouns’, meaning she could no longer name objects. He would hold up two boxes to help her choose her morning cereal, and she would point to her choice. Another man recalled the moment he realised he needed a backup emergency plan: after tumbling down the stairs, he lay on the floor, only to watch his wife step blithely over him on the way to the kitchen to ‘top off her coffee’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;You are not imagining this. It is not your fault. No, he won’t get better. But you might&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie sees internet-based support groups as the single biggest technology innovation for caregiver support: exponentially expanding people’s access to information and strategies to support caregiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘People are trapped at home, oftentimes, or live in rural or remote places,’ she said. ‘But most people have a smartphone where they can log on and watch a webinar.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members nodded in agreement when one commented that the group ‘had saved my life’. But, mostly, there was relief at having found a space where people ‘get it’. A place where they understood the terrible years before a correct diagnosis, years of not knowing what was wrong, of being blamed, of feeling like they weren’t strong enough. They understood the weight of reconciling entrenched anger, hurt and resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Katie navigates for the group is not just information, but translation. An existential formula for survival. You are not imagining this. It is not your fault. No, he won’t get better. But you might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ince FTD often starts with impulsivity, apathy and compulsive habits (in younger people typically, ages 45 to 65), patients can be misdiagnosed with mental health, drug or alcohol problems. For young families, the fallout can be life-altering. Jobs are lost. Children are confused. Partners can be marginalised or gaslit by their own communities. Family members sometimes report that their loved one’s &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;‘BS detector’&lt;/span&gt; is dysfunctional, making them vulnerable to financial scammers and other grifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neurologist Richard Ryan Darby, who runs the Frontotemporal Disorder Clinic at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee, is fascinated by what happens when brain changes lead to brushes with the law or outright criminality. I spoke with him about his work, which sits at the blurry edge where neurology and psychiatry meet. Darby uses MRI scans to study how different parts of the brain talk to each other. In healthy brains, these connections are balanced. But in people with frontotemporal dementia – a disease that strikes at the control centres for behaviour and judgment (remember metacognition) – this balance can fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darby’s theory? When one part of the brain goes offline because of damage, other regions start to take over, sometimes leading to odd or harmful behaviour, like breaking rules or even committing crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Her funny, nerdy librarian husband became ‘zombie-like’, as if he had been body-snatched by aliens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest parts of his job is when his patient ends up behind bars, and he can’t reach them directly. ‘It’s always a struggle to get the patient’s information to the jail medical team,’ he said. ‘I’m never convinced that my patient is going to tell them about their diagnosis.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently spoke with Jill Rovitzky Black, whose ex-husband had frontotemporal dementia. His gruesome murder, while living in a homeless shelter, was widely covered in the news media a few years ago. Jill recounts the darker side of frontotemporal dementia, one that can subject a family or caregiver to intolerable threats. Jill describes her funny, nerdy librarian husband becoming ‘zombie-like’, as if he had been body-snatched by aliens. He gave away thousands of dollars of their savings to ‘internet lovers’, eventually ending up in jail for bank fraud. Jill paid for lawyers and bail but, ultimately, she needed to protect herself and her teenager. She left their 32-year marriage. Jill’s story, like Katie’s, is marked by legions of doctors not listening to her cries that something was strangely wrong, and the diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia was ultimately made too late – on autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darby’s advice to law enforcement is clear: ‘If a law-abiding citizen commits a serious crime over the age of 50, consider the possibility of a brain disorder – and get a specialist involved.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he day after I met Katie at Tatte, she invited me to attend the Rare Disease Day in Boston, organised by the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council (MassBio). The event gathers a mix of leaders: biotech executives, scientists and policymakers all in one place, laser-focused on finding cures. Except today they are gathered to listen to stories. The agenda leans on words like ‘hope’ and ‘understanding’, with talks delivered by patients and families, the common thread being the years of misdiagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watch Katie work the room. She knows people’s backstories like others know recipes. Katie is singular in this environment, hoping to educate the group about the importance of family caregiver support. I snap a picture of her and the former CEO of MassBio. He brightens as she asks him about his family – about his son, whose life was saved by a new drug treatment for cystic fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;It’s about easing the everyday hassles for caregivers so they have the space to care for their own health&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over lunch, we dive back into the weeds of the caregiver experience and her hope for better policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The reason why being an advocate is so important to me is because, when I work with families, I see the same problems over and over: the economic impacts on working-age families, the loss of social networks, the negative impacts on the health of caregivers,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Think of all the policy gaps,’ she adds. No affordable options for respite, or homecare, or adult day programmes that can handle a younger person, to name a few. Medicaid insurance coverage, being a last resort, is only for those who qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie nods when I remark that working with families is never about finding silver linings or expecting white-knuckled grit, but about seeking clarity. It’s about easing the everyday hassles for caregivers so they themselves have the space to live and care for their own health. We agree that the full complexity of supporting caregivers can be summed up in one simple action on our part: listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie interrupts our conversation to take a call. It’s her father’s nursing home. He is now in his 70s with advanced Alzheimer’s. ‘Dad no longer recognises me,’ she says. Then she listens intently, makes a suggestion, and tells them: ‘I’ll stop by after work.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 10:03:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPNHpreEhBZzJEdGFfX0lZVkd4SmcwNzE5Q3VwdXBEcDgxT2p5T21rTkpoQTB4RG1mZmx6b0c1TWtuTTg3MmN5dnY2T25UdV81S2tNcURSamRyRDcwTWtmdi1na2d2TjBpRDJHNXJrR1llZHVRa2EzMlhEMnFER29TNA</guid></item><item><title>男性和女性谁对疼痛更敏感？答案可能会让您大吃一惊。-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/17/chronic-pain-women/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V5Y6ZYMBFJDZXIY5FXYTBXWCFY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It is a common misconception that because women are able to give birth and routinely deal with sometimes agonizing period cramps, they are somehow better able to tolerate pain than men.

But the results, several athletes say, are “game-changing.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It saved my life,” said former NFL offensive guard Robert Gallery, who traveled to Mexico in 2023 to try ibogaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not anxious all the time, I’m not depressed,” he continued, “I can go for a run and be thankful that I’m alive, rather than having a thought that I should step in front of a semi-truck coming down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psychedelic substance is derived from the iboga plant, and proponents tout its ability to treat addiction, post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, or TBI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-right&gt; &lt;div class="video-enhancement" data-vertical data-video-disable-history&gt;   &lt;div class="video-enhancement-player"&gt;    &lt;gn-video-player class="gvp block relative  aspect-[9/16] overflow-hidden  w-full bg-cms-color-brand-background lg:z-10" data-video-player data-video-authors="Clara Harter, Mark E.

at reducing anxiety, depression and cognitive challenges associated with TBI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a miraculous thing,” said retired MMA fighter Tait Fletcher, who credits the treatment with freeing him from suicidal ideation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre even tried ibogaine to see if it could help his Parkinson’s, a neurodegenerative disease linked to TBI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although athletes are just discovering ibogaine, the drug is &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-26/could-psychedelics-help-solve-the-veteran-suicide-crisis-these-california-vets-say-yes"&gt;well known within the veteran community,&lt;/a&gt;

They also exhibited improvements in concentration, information processing and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No other drug has ever been able to alleviate the functional and neuropsychiatric symptoms of traumatic brain injury,” Dr. Nolan Williams, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, said in a statement on the results. “The results are dramatic, and we intend to study this compound further.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt; &lt;div data-element="media-set-2-up-vertical-multi-caption" role="figure" class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-2.5 m-0 -mx-5 md:grid-cols-2 lg:m-0  xxl:-mx-10 "&gt;   &lt;div data-element="media-set-media-container" class="relative flex flex-col gap-2"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0174ab8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/320x480!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e46eef3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/568x852!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dacee76/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/768x1152!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ef9a779/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/1024x1536!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a620089/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/1200x1800!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="A capsule containing a therapeutic dose of ibogaine." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d18171/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/320x480!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6f6cf38/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/568x852!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b7ba4cd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/768x1152!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/78916d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/1024x1536!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7ab8648/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/1200x1800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c81307d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/800x1200!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;p data-element="media-set-caption" class="col-span-full mx-5 my-0 font-cms-font-service-text font-medium text-xs leading-3.5 text-cms-color-brand-text lg:mx-0"&gt; A capsule containing a therapeutic dose of ibogaine, a psychedelic used to help treat traumatic brain injury, PTSD and addiction.

(Magda Stuglik) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To receive federal approval, ibogaine would need to pass through multiple phases of clinical trials at the Food and Drug Administration and be moved by the Drug Enforcement Administration to a less restrictive drug category. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schedule 1 drugs are considered to have no federally accepted medical use, a high potential for abuse and a lack of accepted safety. They also include psilocybin, MDMA, LSD and marijuana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;States can work faster than the federal government by carving out exemptions for supervised ibogaine therapy programs, similar to what &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/11/29/psilocybin-mushrooms-oregon-service-centers-price/" target="_blank"&gt;Oregon has done with psilocybin therapy&lt;/a&gt;. Many states have also opted to legalize marijuana for medicinal or recreational use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-author Dr. Ian Kratter said researchers have reported that ibogaine may stimulate brain healing by causing an increase in certain neurotrophic factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These factors signal for enhanced brain cell survival and synaptic plasticity, which is the ability for brain cells to modify the strength of their connections or even form new connections,” said Kratter, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. “This might facilitate a healing and recovery process after an injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kevin Bickart, a UCLA neurology professor who specializes in brain injury in athletes, said that the Stanford study is “remarkably promising” and that it is reasonable to believe professional athletes could experience similar results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This group [veterans] is a strong analogue for retired professional athletes from high-contact sports like football or hockey who are now dealing with persistent cognitive and emotional difficulties,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ramon Diaz-Arrastia, director of Penn Medicine’s TBI research center, said that ibogaine is “one of the more promising compounds” for treatment of TBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Bickart, Diaz-Arrastia and the Stanford researchers all emphasized the need for larger, randomized controlled trials demonstrating a strong therapeutic benefit and safety profile prior to the treatment being used in America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also highlighted the fact that ibogaine can cause heart problems such as cardiac arrhythmia and needs to be administered under strict medical supervision. In the Stanford study, cardiac monitoring and magnesium were used to mitigate this danger, and researchers reported that no participants experienced adverse cardiac effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallery heard about ibogaine when listening to a podcast about veterans whose struggles resonated with his own. He was at the end of his rope and willing to try anything to free himself from dark thoughts and the ringing noise inside his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was kind of a last-ditch hope for me,” he said. “I was just at that place of needing the noise and the thoughts to stop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallery’s doctor believes he likely &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-nfl-cte-study-20181129-story.html"&gt;developed CTE&lt;/a&gt; (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) as a result of repeated brain injuries during his eight seasons in the NFL. CTE, which can only be diagnosed after death, is a severe neurodegenerative disease that can cause dementia, violent mood swings, loss of motor control and depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many famous athletes who committed suicide were later determined to have CTE, including New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, Hall of Fame linebacker Junior Seau and Chicago Bears safety Dave Duerson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-right&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f123844/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/320x442!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6275fba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/568x784!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6332d44/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/768x1060!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5743b76/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/1024x1413!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6d11dd7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/1200x1656!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="A football player lifts another football player into the air." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c17a5f2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/320x442!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/494c9f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/568x784!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/887e842/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/768x1060!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/84174a4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/1024x1413!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/baf1bc2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/1200x1656!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/baf1bc2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/1200x1656!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Former NFL offensive guard Robert Gallery, who played for the Raiders, credits ibogaine therapy with saving his life and relationship with his family.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Robert Gallery)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fletcher, the former MMA fighter who is also an actor and stunt artist, heard about ibogaine through his Navy SEAL friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had experienced many concussions during his fighting career, but it was head trauma during a stunt gone wrong in 2019 that pushed him over the edge and into an extremely dark place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following morning he woke up in a state of terror. He didn’t know how to pack his bags or get out of the hotel room he had been staying in for the shoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fletcher spent the next year in near-total seclusion, largely unable to leave his house due to light and sound sensitivity. Like Gallery, he tried many conventional and experimental therapies, but nothing compared  with the relief that ibogaine brought him in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re putting Band-Aids on problems through pharmacology,” he said. “This [ibogaine] is a thing that I watched just set people free. Nothing short of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith Jardine, a former UFC fighter, was inspired by Fletcher’s story and traveled to Mexico to receive treatment himself. Retired hockey player Ales Hemsky credits ibogaine with helping free him of the substance use and alcohol dependency that he struggled with after his 16-year career in the NHL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s been seven months now I haven’t had a sip of alcohol,” he said. “It’s life-changing. It really restarts your brain. It gives you a new path.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fletcher has seen the darkness brain injury brings to athletes and the light ibogaine provides. He wants both to be part of a bigger conversation in the professional sports world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6d15046/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/320x239!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b904482/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/568x425!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/faaca3b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/768x574!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/89d35c4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/1024x765!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/65009b2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/1200x897!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="Tait Fletcher, stuntman and former MMA fighter, suffered traumatic brain injury." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/59e2ee4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/320x239!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bccf06c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/568x425!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d635046/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/768x574!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ded1bb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/1024x765!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/03da6cc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/1200x897!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/03da6cc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/1200x897!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Tait Fletcher, stuntman and former MMA fighter, suffered traumatic brain injury as a result of multiple concussive events during his career.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Paul Mobley)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wish that these big organizations were looking into these things differently, because you could elongate careers and elongate lives,” he said. “And ibogaine is certainly a part of that conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Favre also wants to see more attention brought to speeding up medical trials of new treatments for brain injury and related conditions. After taking ibogaine, his Parkinson’s symptoms disappeared for three days before gradually returning, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not disappointed by anything. I’m more excited about the opportunity knowing that I could do it again,” he said. “I’m hoping that this [conversation] helps open the door for not just ibogaine or psychedelic drugs, but just medication or treatments in general that can help people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bickart said there is a major gap in effective, approved treatments for the persistent symptoms of brain injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This leaves many, including veterans and potentially former athletes, without reliable solutions for ongoing disability, cognitive difficulties, and psychiatric conditions like PTSD, depression, and anxiety that can stem from head injuries,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by his own experience with ibogaine, Gallery co-founded a nonprofit called &lt;a class="link" href="https://athletesforcare.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Athletes for Care&lt;/a&gt; to educate athletes with TBI on treatment options and advocate for research into psychedelic-assisted therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sports community is not very good about talking about  mental health,” he said. “Seeing the veterans take charge and take care of their community, I want to do that for the sports community and for my friends that I know that are out there suffering.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-left&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt;

Bickart, the UCLA professor, echoed these concerns, noting that the most critical caution is safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People should be wary of any unregulated treatments, as the purity dosage and presence of contaminants are often unknown,” Bickart said. “The placebo effect can also be very powerful, especially for treatments that require significant effort and cost.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambio, the clinic that Stanford researchers worked with for their observational study on ibogaine, stressed its &lt;a class="link" href="https://ibogaineguidelines.com/" target="_blank"&gt;safety protocols&lt;/a&gt; during treatment, including close monitoring of dosage and patients’ cardiac health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is growing political and scientific momentum in America for more clinical research of ibogaine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Texas approved a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/06/11/texas-psychedelics-ibogaine-treatment-addiction-rick-perry-funding/" target="_blank"&gt;historic $50-million investment&lt;/a&gt; in state funding to support drug development trials for ibogaine, inspired by the results seen by veterans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona legislators approved $5 million in state funding for a clinical study on ibogaine in March, and California legislators are  pushing to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-26/could-psychedelics-help-solve-the-veteran-suicide-crisis-these-california-vets-say-yes"&gt;fast-track the study&lt;/a&gt; of ibogaine and other psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Honestly, I’m amazed to see how much interest there is in ibogaine now,” said Ambio co-founder Jonathan Dickinson. “We’re starting to see things that we would have thought were unimaginable several years ago.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPT3hQS0J4MENub3VjMzRsNjFoWXV4aTUyOFJlZnp4cDBpRGd1M2lkSXpEVXJVSUhQaDhpOVJvM1liQndCRHN0T2kzXzdzbW1FaDRmQ0ZWYy10TDhXbHVVNnhNZVUzMVRNUl8zSUJNRDUyUUlfa3hOTzA3UkVHTF8zWGY3b0hTZ2dxSC1KVmx6QWRsVUN5TmlBX2VaR3p3b2sxMlp5bFAxaTlTMkk5eEtMcy0tMmI</guid></item><item><title>罕见但严重的并发症显示流感的潜在危害-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/health/flu-complications-infection-deaths.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 09:00:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPM3RHcUlkTTBZblgtU2E3aGg2TG1XM1lQLTF4THV3WGlvQUdYZGgyTHI3d0hmWlZLMHNSY2ZOa1J0QUY4cnJXVE5nMEdVZ3E5WlowY1lpNkdZZUMtcUtZeHZ6LXowX0JEMDlMcmVCRC0ydUlKbFl6OGxkVTZ0VGoyRnlWT05sTUFJ</guid></item><item><title>科学认为睡前技巧可以改善每晚的深度睡眠-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/the-bedtime-trick-that-science-says-improves-deep-sleep-every-night/articleshow/123765766.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Struggling to get truly restful sleep isn’t just frustrating; it can affect your metabolism, brain function, and overall health. Recent research highlights that small bedtime habits can significantly improve deep, restorative sleep. A study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(23)00219-7" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; by UC Berkeley researchers found that synchronized brain waves during deep sleep, called slow waves and sleep spindles, play a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels. Individuals with better synchronization experienced improved insulin sensitivity the following day. Take a close look..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding shows that activating the brain’s natural “sleep switch” can have real, measurable health benefits. Simple evening habits can encourage your brain to enter this deep, restorative phase, improving not just restfulness but also long-term metabolic health. In this article, we’ll explore science-backed strategies to optimise your bedtime routine, enhance deep sleep, and wake up feeling genuinely refreshed every morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fix Your Sleep Naturally!

Prioritising good sleep hygiene, such as reducing screen time before bed and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, can help enhance the quality of deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UC Berkeley study showed that individuals with better brain wave synchronization during deep sleep had improved insulin sensitivity the next day. This suggests that quality deep sleep is linked to both metabolic health and overall wellness. Poor deep sleep has been associated with increased risks of diabetes, heart disease, and cognitive decline, making it essential to prioritise this stage of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Science-backed evening habits for better deep sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementing specific habits before bedtime can activate the brain’s natural sleep mechanisms and enhance deep sleep. Practices such as reducing screen time, dimming lights, practicing relaxation techniques, and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule help prepare the body and mind for restorative rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dim your lights&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bright light in the evening can suppress melatonin, the hormone that signals to your body it’s time to sleep. Reducing light exposure an hour before bed helps your brain prepare for restorative sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Limit screen time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phones, tablets, and TVs emit blue light that disrupts melatonin production. Avoid screens at least 30–60 minutes before bed to support natural sleep rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Create a calming pre-sleep routine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gentle stretching, meditation, reading, or listening to soothing music can relax your mind and body. A consistent pre-sleep routine signals your brain that it’s time to transition into deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stick to a consistent sleep schedule&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day helps regulate your internal clock, making it easier to fall asleep and stay in deep sleep longer. This consistency supports better hormone regulation, improves mood, enhances cognitive function, and can even strengthen your immune system over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Optimise your sleep environment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet. Comfortable bedding and minimal noise reduce disturbances, promoting longer periods of deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lifestyle factors that impact deep sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nutrition matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy meals, caffeine, and alcohol close to bedtime can interfere with sleep cycles. A light, balanced snack that includes protein and complex carbs may help, while staying hydrated without overdoing fluids before bed is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Regular physical activity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise can improve sleep patterns and increase deep sleep duration. Avoid vigorous workouts right before bed, as they may be stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also See: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/7-vs-9-hours-of-sleep-whats-the-ideal-amount-and-why-it-might-not-be-what-you-think/articleshow/123118501.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;7 vs 9 hours of sleep: What’s the ideal amount and why it might not be what you think&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When to consult a professional&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If sleep difficulties persist despite following these habits, it may be time to consult a healthcare provider. Persistent issues could indicate conditions such as insomnia, sleep apnea, or other underlying health problems that need professional evaluation and targeted treatment to improve sleep quality and overall well-being. Early intervention can prevent complications and support long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small, science-backed changes to your evening routine can significantly improve deep, restorative sleep. By dimming lights, limiting screens, establishing a calming pre-sleep routine, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, optimising your bedroom environment, and paying attention to diet and exercise, you can help your brain enter the deep sleep phase more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality sleep is more than just hours spent in bed; it’s about achieving the restorative deep sleep that supports overall health, metabolic function, and cognitive performance.

                                        &lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A regulator has approved a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/koala-chlamydia-vaccinations-australia-f0a3e0a7d465dfa5ae0005f414bf6c29"&gt;world-first vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to protect koalas from chlamydia infections, which are causing infertility and death in the iconic native species that is listed as endangered in parts of Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The single-dose vaccine was developed by the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland state after more than a decade of research led by professor of microbiology Peter Timms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research showed the vaccine reduced the likelihood of koalas developing symptoms of chlamydia during breeding age and decreased mortality from the disease in wild populations by at least 65%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent approval by Australia’s veterinary medicine regulator means the vaccine can now be used in wildlife hospitals, veterinary clinics and in the field to protect the nation’s most at-risk koalas, Timms said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“We knew a single-dose vaccine — with no need for a booster — was the answer to reducing the rapid, devastating spread of this disease, which accounts for as much as half of koala deaths across all wild populations in Australia,” Timms said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day, particularly in southeast Queensland and New South Wales, where infection rates within populations are often around 50% and in some cases can reach as high as 70%,” Timms added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deborah Tabart, chair of the conservation charity Australian Koala Foundation, said resources being spent on vaccinating koalas should be redirected at saving koala habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“At the risk of sounding flippant, how can anyone be so delusional as to think that you can vaccinate 100,000 animals? It’s just ridiculous,” Tabart said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tabart’s foundation estimates there are fewer than 100,000 koalas in the wild. The government-backed National Koala Monitoring Program estimated last year there were between 224,000 and 524,000 koalas.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“I accept that chlamydia is an issue for koalas, but I also want people to understand that they’re sick because they haven’t got any habitat,” Tabart said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Queensland Conservation Council, an umbrella organization for more than 50 environmental groups across the state, welcomed the vaccine. But the council’s director, Dave Copeman, echoed Tabart’s focus on preserving koala habitat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really good news. Chlamydia is one of the key stresses that has been putting pressure on koala populations,” Copeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Koalas were at risk before chlamydia outbreaks, and they will remain at risk even if we manage chlamydia perfectly, because we keep on destroying their habitat,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koalas are &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/health-australian-capital-territory-new-south-wales-queensland-environment-f38e062d7ae4806f9d4f7f67dd538968"&gt;listed as endangered species&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the states of Queensland and New South Wales and in the Australian Capital Territory, with habitat loss due to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/general-news-30c1bc2deec7a64735a366745825c70e"&gt;wildfires&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and urban expansion as the major threats. Chlamydia can cause urinary tract infections, infertility, blindness and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment with antibiotics can disrupt an infected koala’s ability to digest eucalyptus leaves — its sole food source — leading to starvation, the university said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The research has been supported by the federal, New South Wales and Queensland governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Environment Minister Murray Watt said his government had contributed to the vaccine’s development through a 76 million Australian dollar ($50 million) Saving Koalas Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that koalas need help to fight diseases like chlamydia. It’s a widespread threat impacting their reproductive health and causing infertility,” Watt said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koalas are iconic Australian marsupials, like &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/baby-wombat-american-influencer-australia-marsupial-cube-poop-d97862f5a9b86dbacc1293e2a8adc9f9"&gt;wombats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/kangaroos"&gt;kangaroos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. They spend most of their time eating and sleeping in eucalyptus trees, and their paws have two opposing thumbs to help them grasp and climb up tree trunks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia’s wild koala populations have declined steeply in the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facing compounded threats from disease, habitat loss, climate change and road collisions, koalas could become extinct by 2050, according to a 2020 assessment from the New South Wales government.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A Los Angeles County child has died due to complications from a measles infection, according to the &lt;a href="http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5135" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Los Angeles County Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say that the "school-aged" child acquired measles in infancy, before they were old enough to receive the vaccine, which is generally administered between 12 and 15 months of age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the child recovered from their initial illness, they later developed subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, which is also known as SSPE. Officials said that the complication is universally fatal and can occur in people who had measles early in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSPE is a rare, progressive brain disorder that can develop two to 10 years after a person's initial measles infection, even if the patient has seemingly fully recovered, officials said. It is characterized by a gradual loss of neurological function, with death occurring one to three years after it is initially diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said that there is no known cure or treatment for SSPE, which impacts about 1 in 10,000 people with measles. They say that the risk may be much higher for those who get measles as infants, at a rate of 1 in 600 people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This case is a powerful reminder of how dangerous measles can be, especially for our most vulnerable community members," said a statement from County Health Officer Dr. Muntu Davis. "Infants too young to be vaccinated rely on all of us to help protect them through community immunity. Vaccination is not just about protecting yourself — it's about protecting your family, your neighbors, and especially children who are too young to be vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-us-cases-record-high-since-1992/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles cases in the U.S. hit the highest total recorded in more than 30 years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They took the incident as a time to remind the public that measles is a highly contagious viral infection that can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which is used to protect against measles, mumps and rubella, health officials said. While most children will receive their first vaccine dose between 12 and 15 months, a second dose isn't administered until they're between four and six years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms include a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash that develops three to five days after the fever is first noticed. If people exhibit any of those signs, they're advised to stay home and avoid school, work or any other public gatherings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Department of Public Health officials urged people to check their own immunization status and to notify their healthcare provider if someone they know is at a higher risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/?CDC_AAref_Val=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmeasles%2Fcases-outbreaks.html%3Futm_content%3D%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_name%3D%26utm_source%3Dgovdelivery%26utm_term%3D&amp;amp;utm_content=&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_name=&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;amp;utm_term=" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;So far in 2025&lt;/a&gt;, there have been 1,454 reported cases of measles in the United States, most of which are linked to a measles outbreak affecting Texas, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Los Angeles County, officials say that the majority of reported cases have been in people who were either unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, and that 12% of infected patients required hospitalization or isolation. Three people have died from acute measles-related complications, they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last known case of the virus in a county resident was &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/los-angeles-public-health-officials-confirm-measles-case-in-lax-traveler/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;reported in August&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. DPH officials say that eight cases of measles in individuals who were in the county while infectious, four were non-residents.&lt;/p&gt;

The disease begins with seizures, cognitive decline and involuntary muscle spasms, and progresses to dementia, coma and eventually death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most pediatricians in the U.S. have never seen a child with SSPE because we’ve been vaccinating kids against measles for decades,” &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-02-10/adam-ratner-booster-shots-book"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said Dr. Adam Ratner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based pediatric infectious-disease specialist and author of the book, “Booster Shots: The Urgent Lessons of Measles and the Uncertain Future of Children’s Health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health could not release further details on the child’s age, gender or location due to patient privacy laws, a spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department could only confirm that the child acquired measles before becoming eligible for an MMR vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This case is a painful reminder of how dangerous measles can be, especially for our most vulnerable community members,” county health officer Dr. Muntu Davis said in a statement. “Infants too young to be vaccinated rely on all of us to help protect them through community immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children typically receive their first MMR dose when they are 12 to 15 months old and a second dose between the ages of 4 and 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early first dose from the age of 6 to 11 months is recommended for babies traveling internationally or through an international hub. Infants under the age of 6 months are too young to receive the MMR shot, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according to guidelines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very young babies rely on antibodies acquired during gestation and herd immunity to protect them from measles, which killed roughly 400 children every year in the U.S. before the introduction of the combined MMR vaccine in 1971.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles was “eliminated” in the U.S. in 2000, meaning the disease was rare enough and immunity widespread enough to prevent local transmission if an errant case popped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 25 years, parents in the U.S. have been able to trust that herd immunity will keep infants safe from measles until they are old enough to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This recent death may be a signal that social contract is beginning to break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood immunization rates have been slowly but steadily falling nationwide, from 95% in the years before the COVID pandemic to below 93% &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in the 2023-24 school year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California, one of five U.S. states that banned all non-medical vaccine exemptions, the vaccination &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/2023-2024KindergartenReport.pdf#:~:text=The%20proportion%20of%20kindergarten%20students%20reported%20as,up%20on%20immunizations%20missed%20during%20the%20pandemic" target="_blank"&gt;rate that year was&lt;/a&gt; 96.2%.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3200132/"&gt;Appendix cancer&lt;/a&gt; is a condition that, until recently, was so rare that most people never gave it a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, it was the kind of disease that doctors might encounter only once or twice in a career, and it was almost always found in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/appendix-cancers-rise-younger-generations-study-finds-rcna211796"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt; a surprising and concerning trend is emerging: &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02479"&gt;appendix cancer is being diagnosed more often&lt;/a&gt;, and it's increasingly affecting people in their 30s, 40s and even younger. This shift has left many experts puzzled and searching for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-pooping-habits-could-harm-your-health-in-7-ways-research-shows"&gt;Your Pooping Habits Could Harm Your Health in 7 Ways, Research Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appendix is a small, finger-shaped pouch attached to the large intestine. Its purpose in the body is &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Why-do-Humans-have-an-Appendix.aspx"&gt;still debated&lt;/a&gt;, but it's best known for causing appendicitis, a painful inflammation that often requires emergency surgery. What's less well known is that  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="174031" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; can develop in the appendix, usually without any warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02479"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, has shown that the number of appendix cancer cases has increased dramatically among people born after the 1970s. In fact, the incidence has tripled or even quadrupled in younger generations compared with those born in the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the overall numbers are still small (appendix cancer affects just a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9418812/#:%7E:text=Overall%2C%20the%20incidence%20of%20appendiceal,5.1%20to%2011.2%20per%20cent."&gt;handful of people&lt;/a&gt; per million each year) the rapid rise is striking. Even more notable is that about one in three cases now occurs in adults under 50, a much higher proportion than seen in other types of gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what's behind this surge? &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/health-and-wellbeing/vitamin-d-colon-cancer-b2744234.html"&gt;No one knows for sure&lt;/a&gt;, but one of the first suspects is the dramatic change in lifestyle and environment over the past several decades. Obesity rates have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3543235/"&gt;soared&lt;/a&gt; since the 1970s, and being overweight is a known risk factor for many cancers, including those of the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, diets have shifted toward more processed foods, sugary drinks, and red or processed meats, all of which have been linked to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/king-charles-is-changing-his-diet-to-keep-his-cancer-at-bay-heres-what-the-evidence-says-245582"&gt;increased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; in other &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-eating-yoghurt-regularly-could-lower-your-risk-of-bowel-cancer-251942"&gt;parts of the gut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity has also &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/exercise-proves-powerful-in-preventing-colon-cancer-recurrence-new-study-257983"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt;, with more people spending long hours sitting at desks or in front of screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that we are being exposed to new environmental factors that previous generations didn't face. The industrialisation of food production, the widespread use of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39518141/"&gt;plastics and chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, and changes in water quality might all play a role. However, the evidence is still in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167729" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167729" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/glass-of-water.jpg" alt="water pouring from tap into glass" class="size-full wp-image-167729" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/glass-of-water.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/glass-of-water-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/glass-of-water-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167729" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Changes in water quality might play a role in appendix cancer cases increasing. (pixelshot/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hard to detect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes appendix cancer especially challenging is how difficult it is to detect. Unlike colon cancer, which can sometimes be found early through screening colonoscopies, appendix cancer &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33094592/"&gt;usually flies under the radar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms, if they appear at all, are vague and easy to dismiss. People might experience mild abdominal pain, bloating or changes in bowel habits, which are common complaints for many benign conditions. As a result, most cases are only discovered after surgery for suspected appendicitis, when it's often too late for early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the rise in cases, there is no routine screening test for appendix cancer. The disease is simply too rare to justify widespread screening, and the appendix can be difficult to visualise with standard imaging or endoscopy. This means that both patients and doctors need to be extra vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone experiences persistent or unusual abdominal symptoms, especially if they're under 50, it's important not to ignore them. Early investigation and prompt treatment can make a significant difference in outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in appendix cancer among younger adults is part of a broader trend seen in other gastrointestinal cancers, such as those of the colon and stomach. These cancers, too, are being diagnosed more often in people under 50, suggesting that shared risk factors may be at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this shift are complex and probably involve a mix of genetics, lifestyle, environment and perhaps even changes in our &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bug-drugs-bacteria-based-cancer-therapies-are-finally-overcoming-barriers-251278"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; – the bacteria in our intestines that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39882224/"&gt;live with us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, antibiotics have been used more frequently, both in medicine and in agriculture. This widespread use can alter the balance of bacteria in our guts, which &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7916407/"&gt;might influence cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some recent research suggests that early-life exposure to antibiotics could have &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/colon-cancer-rates-are-rising-among-young-people-could-changes-to-childrens-gut-bacteria-explain-why-255176"&gt;long-term effects on the digestive system&lt;/a&gt;, but more studies are needed to confirm this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164410" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging.jpg" alt="Different types of tablets or pills in foil packs" class="size-full wp-image-164410" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging-484x415.jpg 484w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging-600x514.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164410" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Could early-life exposure to antibiotics have something to do with the rise in appendix cancer? (PublicDomainPictures/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the best advice is to focus on prevention and awareness. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet rich in fruit, vegetables and whole grains, and staying physically active are all steps that can lower the risk of many types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol intake are also &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alcohol-plays-a-major-role-in-new-cancer-cases/"&gt;important&lt;/a&gt;. While these measures can't guarantee protection against appendix cancer, they are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-cut-your-risk-of-cancer-by-an-oncology-consultant-245858"&gt;proven strategies&lt;/a&gt; for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are working hard to unravel the mystery of why appendix cancer is rising so rapidly among younger generations. Understanding the causes will be crucial for developing better ways to prevent, detect and treat this rare but increasingly important disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, raising awareness among healthcare providers and the public is essential. By recognising the signs and taking action when symptoms arise, we can improve the chances of catching appendix cancer early and giving patients the best possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/deadly-kissing-bug-disease-is-on-the-rise-across-the-us-cdc-warns"&gt;Deadly Kissing Bug Disease Is on The Rise Across The US, CDC Warns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of appendix cancer's rise is a reminder that even rare diseases can become more common when our environment and lifestyles change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also a call to action for further research and for all of us to pay attention to our bodies, seek medical advice when something feels off, and support efforts to understand and combat this puzzling trend.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258607/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

"We saw Danish patients out of their own pocket paying for tickets to China to get all sorts of treatments – endangering their health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Some went to private hospitals in Germany that offered new treatments unavailable in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Back then, Denmark's record on cancer was low compared to that of other rich countries. But so was the UK's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;From 1995 to 1999, Denmark's five-year survival rate for rectal cancer was essentially tied with the UK's, on around 48%, according to the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership, a research body. It put both nations well below countries like Australia, which had a 59% rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 cnKFtO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Now, thanks to a bold plan, Denmark's performance on cancer has jumped ahead. By 2014, its five-year survival rate for rectal cancer had risen to 69%, close to Australia's. (The UK's rose too, but only to 62%.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Analysts think the trend has probably continued (though these are the most up-to-date figures available). And it's a similar story for other cancers, including colon, stomach, and lung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This Danish success story has caught the attention of UK policymakers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting says that aspects of the Danish model are feeding into government plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Some could well be included in a new long-term cancer plan for England, due to be published in the autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;So, what's their secret, and can the NHS learn from Denmark?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Big investments and thoughtful touches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Walking today into Herlev Hospital on the outskirts of Copenhagen makes for a rather different experience to arriving at an average NHS hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The foyer is hung with bright, vivid paintings by the Danish artist Poul Gernes.

Then, if treatment is required, it has to start within the two weeks of diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;If these targets are not met patients have the right to transfer to another hospital - or, failing that, another country - whilst still being funded by the Danish health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This is quite a contrast to the UK nations.

Addressing this, she says, should improve the quality of cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"That means clarity over who in the government and NHS is responsible for delivering each part of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Ultimately, responsibility for the success or failure of the plan should rest with the health and social care secretary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;She points out that there are similarities between England and Denmark's state-run health systems - for example, the roughly similar amount they spend on health as a share of national income, meaning Denmark's example could be followed in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But this would require a long-term plan, political leadership, higher investment, more cancer screening, and stronger targets.

Alcohol consumption is similar in both nations, though obesity levels in Denmark are lower and smoking rates are higher. (One Danish health leader told me that they were envious of UK initiatives on smoking, with the minimum age for tobacco sales rising each year.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, there are certain challenges specific to the UK: the population of England, for example, is nearly 10 times larger than Denmark's population. And the NHS is a complex organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Still, ministers have made no secret of their interest in the Danish system, with an official visit earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Wes Streeting, the UK Health Secretary, says: "Denmark's healthcare system is known the world over for its excellence, having transformed outcomes through its cancer plans, and Health Minister Karin Smyth's trip to the country earlier this year offered us vital insights up close."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Mr Streeting says these insights have "fed into" government health plans to "speed up cancer diagnoses and deliver cutting edge treatments to the NHS front line quicker".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Michelle Mitchell of Cancer Research UK agrees that Denmark offers a useful template. "They are diagnosing cancer earlier, people are surviving longer, more people are taking up screening – all of those factors as well as investment in workforce and kit are critical components of a cancer plan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;She argues that British health ministers could move towards Danish-style national waiting time targets rather than the UK's current system of "benchmarks", which are weaker and haven't been met since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;'This is unfinished business'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The greater challenge for the NHS though, is that there are so many other problems - crowded A&amp;amp;E departments, overstretched staff and, as one analyst put it, "multiple fires burning" - meaning that it can be difficult to persuade health leaders to focus on cancer survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Ruth Thorlby, assistant director of policy at The Health Foundation think tank, says that policymakers in London and Copenhagen both realised at the same time, in the 1990s, that cancer needed urgent attention and urgent plans were drawn up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But whilst Danish policymakers saw policies through, she argues that in the UK the momentum "dissipated", as other priorities and short-term problems emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"This is unfinished business - over the last decade there has been a move away from cancer plans," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="PA Wire A member of staff on a NHS hospital ward" class="sc-86c96223-0 fHZDyi"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-86c96223-2 hqrvRC"&gt;PA Wire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Ruth Thorlby says that while Denmark stuck with its cancer plans, the UK lost momentum as other priorities took over&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;At the heart of Denmark's success was a sense of political consensus. From the 1990s onwards, figures from all major parties agreed that cancer should be a priority. This is a level of agreement the UK has not managed to reach, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Mr Fisker of the Danish Cancer Society argues that the usual cut-and-thrust of party politics needs to be set aside. "Politicians must promise each other there is going to be a long, lasting partnership. And health leaders need to operate on a 10-, 15-, 20-year basis," he says - longer than the life of any one government or party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But does he think that's possible in the UK? After all, Westminster is not known for much long-term, cross-party thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"If you are really decisive, if you really want to do this and are committed to it over a period of time, and you are also ready to invest then I think it can be done," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;With a pause, he adds: "Nothing comes without investment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/bbcindepth" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="bbc-indepth" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;BBC InDepth&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="is-the-home-on-the-website-and-app-for-the-best-analysis,-with-fresh-perspectives-that-challenge-assumptions-and-deep-reporting-on-the-biggest-issues-of-the-day.-and-we-showcase-thought-provoking-content-from-across-bbc-sounds-and-iplayer-too.-you-can-send-us-your-feedback-on-the-indepth-section-by-clicking-on-the-button-below." class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt; is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

&lt;p&gt;Breaking with national public health policy, California officials are recommending that children 6 months to 2 years old, as well as people who are pregnant and lactating, should get vaccinated against COVID-19, following guidance from reputable medical groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement to KQED, the California Department of Public Health said Wednesday that it endorses recent recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for COVID-19, influenza and RSV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidance, released last month, was in line with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations under the Biden Administration.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“As a part of our efforts, along with our West Coast state partners and other states around the country, to provide a unified science-based approach to protecting the health of our communities, California is carefully considering guidance from various trusted national medical professional and scientifically based organizations,” the CDPH said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, the CDC sets vaccine recommendations based on the available data, which insurers use to set reimbursement guidelines. But under the direction of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — who has espoused virulent anti-vaccine rhetoric for decades — the CDC now only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; COVID vaccines for “most adults ages 18 years and older.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That left many in the medical community concerned that confusing and inconsistent messaging would cause vaccine rates to drop, and even make vaccines unaffordable for lower-income families whose insurance providers may no longer cover them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/abraar-karan"&gt;Dr. Abraar Karan&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease physician at Stanford University, said the state is making a “wise” choice because data show that vaccines help minimize COVID-19 infections in typically healthier populations like children older than six months and young adults, and reduce the risk of urgent care and emergency room visits for COVID-19 patients “by 33%.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s pretty significant, and sort of mirrors what you see with flu vaccines as well. Functionally, that is what we are hoping for, for the general population, is to make you get less sick, fewer days of [missed] work [and] less utilization of the health care system,” Karan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“COVID spreads in waves. We have multiple waves per year, and they do require a large usage of our health care system. So if we have a safe, effective vaccine to reduce that healthcare usage in that healthier group, that’s important.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Karan said that because California is following the guidance of leading medical groups, it’s likely insurance companies will cover the shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, he said, those states are adhering to the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Whereas what is happening at HHS is … a lot of opinions, particularly from RFK Jr. himself, on unproven therapeutics, on risks that are not borne out by the data. And then he’s sort of just hand-waving and doing whatever he wants,” Karan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428533/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-committee-acip"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; all 17 members of an advisory committee that helps the CDC form its vaccine policies to begin to “&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/wsj-kennedy-op-ed-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines.html"&gt;restore public trust in vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/john-swartzberg"&gt;Dr. John Swartzberg&lt;/a&gt;, professor emeritus of infectious diseases and vaccinology at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health, said that by following the advice of leading medical groups, California and the other states of the West Coast Alliance are making it easier for families to get their children vaccinated against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you look at the data for very young children in terms of hospitalization and death, the rates are pretty comparable to older Americans,” Swartzberg said. “This is a vulnerable population where protection is terribly important. So I think that the California Department of Public Health, in following the advice of the American Academy of Pediatrics, is spot on.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Swartzberg said it is interesting to note that President Donald Trump even pushed back on Kennedy’s anti-vax stance in the last few days. Trump even &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/08/vaccine-policy-cracks-showing-between-trump-kennedy/"&gt;expressed some skepticism&lt;/a&gt; about Florida’s push to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think there are people in the administration who recognize that this is a hot button item, and all the Republicans are not really on board with where Kennedy is, so that might translate into the administration not trying to make a political football out of this with California,” he said. “We are very fortunate here in California. We have a department of health that is science-based and really solid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-can-get-a-new-covid-vaccine-right-now"&gt;Who can get a new COVID vaccine right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updated 2025–26 COVID-19 vaccines are currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com/scheduling/patient-lookup?lob=rximz&amp;amp;flow=vaccine&amp;amp;icid=global-nav"&gt;CVS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.walgreens.com/topic/promotion/covid-vaccine.jsp?ban=immhub_covidinfo"&gt;Walgreens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.safeway.com/pharmacy/covid-19.html"&gt;Safeway &lt;/a&gt;pharmacies in California. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Pharmacies take their cue from the federal government, not the states, so they’ve always been the first places that COVID-19 vaccines roll out — before shots become more widely available through providers and public health authorities.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pharmacy appointments are only available to people who, during the online booking process, say they are either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Age 65 and older&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Have a health condition that could make someone at higher risk from COVID-19.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what counts as “high risk”? To find out if you or a family member might qualify, you can consult &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/risk-factors/index.html"&gt;the CDC’s current list of health conditions&lt;/a&gt; that potentially put you at higher risk of severe illness, hospitalization or death from COVID-19, which includes cancer, chronic lung, kidney and liver disease and certain disabilities. However, it also encompasses other factors like mental health conditions — including depression — obesity and being a current or former smoker.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When listing some of these conditions, CVS’s online appointment also suggests “any other conditions or situations that place you at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (consult your pharmacist or medical provider if you need help).”&lt;/p&gt;

            A school-age child in Los Angeles County who had measles as an infant has died of a rare complication, the county health department said Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp600053b6q3x6tc176@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The child was infected before they were eligible to receive the measles vaccine, the agency says; the first vaccination is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; between 12 months and 15 months of age, followed by a second dose between ages 4 and 6.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp600063b6q4j4n8gy6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They recovered from that infection but developed a condition called subacute sclerosing panenecephalitis, which affects about 1 in 10,000 unvaccinated people who get measles overall but up to 1 in 600 of those who catch the virus in infancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp600073b6qyeur2xil@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560673/" target="_blank"&gt;SSPE&lt;/a&gt;, as the complication is also known, develops years after measles infection and can cause changes in personality or behavior, problems with speech and motor functions, and epilepsy, followed by a vegetative state. There’s no cure, and it’s fatal in about 95% of cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp6000b3b6qw53g0esd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The United States has had 1,454 measles cases this year, more than at any other point since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp600083b6q6iizuybt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Los Angeles County Health Officer Dr. Muntu Davis said in a &lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5135" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that the child’s case is “a painful reminder of how dangerous measles can be, especially for our most vulnerable community members.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp600093b6q9mxcsj1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine are highly effective against measles, preventing 97% of infections. Experts recommend that at least 95% of a community be vaccinated to prevent the disease’s spread, but immunization rates have been &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/health/vaccine-preventable-diseases-pertussis-polio"&gt;falling&lt;/a&gt; across the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp6000a3b6q597efcj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Infants younger than six months are too young to be vaccinated and rely on maternal antibodies and community immunity to reduce their risk of exposure,” the Los Angeles County Health Department said in the statement. “By getting vaccinated, individuals not only protect themselves but also help shield vulnerable populations — including infants, pregnant people, and those with weakened immune systems — from measles infection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Jason Mitton wanted one of the new COVID-19 vaccines before leaving on a business trip. But the pharmacists at a drug store near his home in Austin, Texas, refused.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He's like: 'Do you have a doctor's note?' I said: 'No, I don't.' He said: 'Well, the FDA standards say that you don't qualify. And our policy is that we won't administer it unless you qualify,'" says Mitton. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mitton, who's 55 and says he has high blood pressure and high cholesterol that's controlled by medication, plans to keep trying to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it's ridiculous," Mitton says. "I think it should be a person's right to get the vaccine or not. So I'm very angry."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The same goes for Cheryl Huges, 64, who lives outside Cleveland. She was planning to get another shot as soon as the updated versions became available. But, she's not eligible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm furious," says Hughes. "Who wants to get sick?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For the first time, COVID vaccines aren't available to anyone ages 6 months and older to obtain simply by walking into a pharmacy and asking to get inoculated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a major departure, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515503/fda-covid-vaccines-restricted" target="_blank"&gt;only approved the shots&lt;/a&gt; for those at greatest risk for getting seriously ill from COVID because they're at least 65 years old or have another health issue that makes them highly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump administration health officials argue that most otherwise healthy, younger people have so much immunity that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But many Americans who don't meet the new criteria do still want to get vaccinated to avoid getting sick or spreading the virus to vulnerable family members.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And independent medical organizations like the Infectious Disease Society of America argue that &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2025/fdas-narrow-covid-19-vaccine-label-ignores-science-and-puts-millions-of-lives-at-risk/" target="_blank"&gt;everyone should have the option&lt;/a&gt; to get vaccinated because there is convincing evidence that the vaccines reduce the risk of serious complications, including hospitalization and death, even for people who are otherwise healthy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Hughes wants to remain healthy so she can care for her husband, who has dementia. She's his only caretaker.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If I get sick, my husband might have to go into a care facility. I could lose my job. It would be terrible," Hughes says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What it takes to get the shot&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Secretary Kennedy has repeatedly claimed the new rules won't prevent anyone from getting vaccinated if they want to.  But many people have told NPR that they are having trouble. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In principle, you can still get vaccinated if you meet the criteria, get a doctor to prescribe a shot, or if you "self attest" that you're eligible by telling the pharmacist you meet the criteria.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But sometimes people are turned away because supplies of the reformulated shots haven't arrived yet. Sometimes it's because they didn't meet the new criteria. Or they're told they can get a shot if they get a prescription first, only to be inexplicably rejected anyway when they return with a doctor's order.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some people describe hunting for a shot from pharmacy to pharmacy and doctor's office to doctor's office — even sometimes seeking one out of state.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The companies that make the shots, Moderna, Pfizer and Novavax, didn't say exactly how many doses they were making this year, given the narrower FDA approvals. But Pfizer says it is preparing "similar volumes" as last year, and that it's confident it will meet demand. It also says millions of doses have already shipped.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Claire Hannan, &lt;a href="https://www.immunizationmanagers.org/staff-member/claire-hannan/" target="_blank"&gt;the executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers&lt;/a&gt;, says she doesn't expect vaccine supply to be a problem. She says pharmacies are able to order the COVID shots and they've been shipped out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it's going to be harder to access," she says. "But I think anybody that wants it, you know, will be able to get it. But they're just going to have to work hard to find it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But some clinics and pharmacies haven't received the supplies they've ordered yet. And some doctors' offices, including pediatricians, and clinics may decide not to stock the shots this year if they don't expect enough demand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you're trying to find one, Pfizer and &lt;a href="https://products.modernatx.com/finder" target="_blank"&gt;Moderna &lt;/a&gt;both have &lt;a href="https://www.vaxassist.com/schedule?cmp=188442362390&amp;amp;utm_source=GOOGLE&amp;amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;amp;pid=Scheduler&amp;amp;utm_term=pfizer%20vaccine%20available%20near%20me&amp;amp;network=g&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22943851190&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAABK5w6FawaR8GMs9_iPQ0cImTHd-Y&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw5onGBhDeARIsAFK6QJYqqC3A_jZAbNDWf_hifoXY60dX6YR_LiYEEicIdMfLaYWnOJpbL7gaAruoEALw_wcB" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine-finder websites&lt;/a&gt; up and running.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Waiting for the CDC's guidance&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One major snag is that pharmacists in some states are prohibited from administering the shots until the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issues specific recommendations for who should get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In past years, those recommendations came in the spring. But Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428533/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-committee-acip" target="_blank"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; the entire &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt;, the independent group that formulates those recommendations, and replaced the members with his own advisers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy's new committee is finally scheduled to meet next week about the COVID vaccines and other issues. That could alleviate some of the problems, including hesitancy that some pharmacists and doctors have because of the changing rules and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But it remains unclear what the advisers will do. They could make it easier, or harder, for people to get a shot. Many of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5429604/cdc-rfk-acip-vaccine-committee" target="_blank"&gt;committee's new members&lt;/a&gt; share Kennedy's anti-vaccine views.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Either way, until the committee meeting happens, the shots that are part of the Vaccines for Children Program won't ship, says Hannan, who explained that people haven't been able to order them yet. About half of kids in the U.S. are eligible for free vaccines through the program.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health insurance coverage could also prove tricky. Although Aetna and United Healthcare told NPR they will cover the COVID shot with no cost sharing for people with fully insured plans — even for people outside the FDA's narrower approval — it's not clear what other insurance companies will do. And even people who have Aetna or United could have other kinds&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;of plans that don't cover the shot, which could set patients back around $200.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Fears for vulnerable family members, kids&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, many Americans have been scrambling to try to figure out how to still get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm very angry, frustrated," says Allison Cote, 32, of Bristol, Conn.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cote wants to stay well to protect her father, who has heart failure, other family members who have diabetes, and one relative who recently got a kidney transplant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She's also concerned about her 16-month-old son. He's not eligible to get vaccinated either this year, even though COVID can be very dangerous for babies. The new shots are only approved for children who have conditions that put them at high risk.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In fact, the CDC this spring &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413179/covid-vaccine-children-pregnant-rfk-cdc" target="_blank"&gt;dropped recommendations&lt;/a&gt; that children and pregnant women routinely get vaccinated. For children, the agency recommends parents talk to their doctors first about vaccinating their children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's just really upsetting," Cote says. "Why do I have to jump through hoops to do this? It's kind of scary."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If she has to, Cote says she may do what some people are doing: just say she's eligible. But she doesn't feel great about that. And she has no idea how to get a shot for her baby boy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's hard to watch this play out and know that there are so many lives at risk — and potentially my son's life is at risk too," Cote says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stephan Neidenbach, 45, a public school teacher from Annapolis, Md., is frustrated and angry too. He's worried about getting sick and spreading the virus to his students, his elderly parents or his mother-in-law, who has lung problems.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I would feel horrible if I did get it and if I passed it off to someone that I cared about. It's terrifying," Neidenbach says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He's considering fibbing about his eligibility to get a shot too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Therese McRae, 37, of Sandy, Utah, also wants to get vaccinated. Her main motivation is to protect her 4-year-old daughter, who has Type 1 diabetes, which puts her at risk for serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Being a parent of a young child with a complex medical diagnosis is hard enough," McRae says. "Having folks around her not being able to be vaccinated increases her risk. It's just very overwhelming. It's scary."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Karen Lambey, 43, who lives near Richmond, Va., desperately wants a vaccine too. She says she became immunocompromised after developing long COVID. Her pharmacist told her she needed a prescription to get the shot and she hasn't been able to find a doctor to give her one.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Any sort of flu, COVID, would set me back significantly," Lambey says. "These are all extra hurdles that keep adding up. I feel disappointed because this is something that is important to my health."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And Lambey's parents are immune compromised too. She's afraid of spreading the virus to them. "That could potentially be life-threatening for them," she says. "I couldn't live with that."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

These symptoms don’t just disrupt daily life—they can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-disturb-your-sleep-8551851" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;interfere with sleep&lt;/a&gt;, social activities and overall well-being. And while treatments exist, many people find them unsatisfying or experience side effects, making prevention and lifestyle strategies especially appealing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; shines a spotlight on magnesium, a mineral your body needs for many vital functions. Researchers found that adults with signs of magnesium depletion were more likely to experience OAB symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Since magnesium is essential for muscle relaxation and nerve signaling, the findings add to growing evidence that this nutrient may play a role in bladder health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study analyzed data from 28,621 adults ages 20 to 80 who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2005 and 2018. OAB was identified through questionnaires asking about urgency, frequency, nighttime urination and leakage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of relying on single blood tests or diet recalls, researchers used a magnesium depletion score (MgDS), which combines four factors that influence magnesium levels: diuretic use, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, kidney function and heavy alcohol consumption. Participants were then categorized into low, middle or high magnesium depletion groups.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People with higher magnesium depletion scores were more likely to have OAB. Each one-point increase in MgDS was linked with a 9% higher chance of OAB. Compared with those in the low MgDS group, people in the middle group had 17% higher odds of OAB, and those in the high group had 20% higher odds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The association was strongest among women, adults ages 40 to 60, people with obesity, and non-smokers. Researchers suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/signs-youre-not-getting-enough-magnesium-11740104" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium deficiency&lt;/a&gt; may increase bladder muscle excitability and promote inflammation, both of which can trigger urgency and frequency.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, the study has important limitations. Because it was cross-sectional, it cannot prove that low magnesium causes OAB—only that the two are linked. OAB was self-reported, which may introduce bias, and magnesium status was estimated rather than directly measured. More research, especially long-term studies and clinical trials, will be needed to confirm these results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even with these caveats, the study points toward a simple, food-first approach: make sure you’re getting enough magnesium. Adults need between &lt;strong&gt;310 and 420 milligrams per day&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on age and sex, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Many Americans fall short of these levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium is abundant in everyday foods, especially &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7878282/complete-plant-based-diet-grocery-list/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based staples&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leafy greens&lt;/strong&gt;, like spinach and Swiss chard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legumes&lt;/strong&gt;, such as black beans, lentils, and chickpeas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuts and seeds&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly almonds, cashews and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-1-underrated-food-to-increase-your-magnesium-intake-11756166" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Building meals with these foods supports not only bladder health but also heart, bone and metabolic health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you need some ideas to get started, try a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/no-cook-white-bean-spinach-caprese-salad-8645040" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;spinach and bean salad&lt;/a&gt;, sprinkle pumpkin seeds onto yogurt or swap white rice for quinoa at dinner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you suspect you’re not meeting your magnesium needs, talk with your healthcare provider about testing your levels or considering a supplement.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study using national survey data suggests that magnesium deficiency is linked with a greater risk of overactive bladder, particularly among women and people with obesity.

          &lt;p&gt;A child in Los Angeles has died of a measles-related brain disorder stemming from an infection in infancy, &lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5135"&gt;the Los Angeles County health department reported Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the child died of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare, but always fatal complication that strikes years after an initial measles infection. The health department's announcement offered few details about the child, including the child's age, but said that the child had contracted the virus before they were old enough to be vaccinated against measles. The first of two &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html"&gt;recommended doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is given between 12 and 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This case is a painful reminder of how dangerous measles can be, especially for our most vulnerable community members," Muntu Davis, a Los Angeles County health officer, said in a statement. "Infants too young to be vaccinated rely on all of us to help protect them through community immunity. Vaccination is not just about protecting yourself—it's about protecting your family, your neighbors, and especially children who are too young to be vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSPE is caused by a persistent measles infection in the central nervous system. Children infected with the virus may go through the standard disease progression—flu-like symptoms, high fever, the telltale rash—and then appear to fully recover. But, for a small few, the virus remains and SSPE emerges years later, often seven to 10 years after the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles health department noted that SSPE generally affects about 1 in 10,000 people with measles, but the risk may be much higher—about 1 in 600—for those who get measles as infants, such as the child who recently died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With widespread vaccination, which led to measles being declared eliminated from the US in 2000, SSPE has virtually disappeared in the US. However, with vaccination rates slipping and anti-vaccine misinformation and views gripping the country, health experts fear seeing more of these devastating cases. Already, the US measles case count for the year is at &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/measles-cases-reach-33-year-high-as-rfk-jr-pursues-anti-vaccine-agenda/"&gt;a 33-year high&lt;/a&gt;, and two other children, as well as an adult, died from the acute infection this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;As authorized by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Virginia Code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt; § 54.1-3408 (I), this standing order will allow pharmacists to administer the vaccine to Virginians 65 years of age and older and to Virginians between the ages of 18 and 64 years of age with at least one underlying medical condition without a prescription.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559685":-720,"335559740":240}'&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559685":-720,"335559740":240}'&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;“We realize this has been top of mind for many Virginians in the past several days,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Dr. Shelton &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;said, “and we are resolved to increase access to the updated formulation of the COVID-19 vaccine to all eligible Virginians.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559685":-720,"335559740":240}'&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559685":-720,"335559740":240}'&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;In Virginia, pharmacists may administer vaccines in two ways: either under the direct authorization of a medical provider or by following the Virginia Board of Pharmacy’s statewide pharmacy protocols. These statewide pharmacy protocols permit pharmacists to administer vaccines in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Immunization Schedule. Currently, the CDC schedule references the 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine formulation, but it does not yet include the 2025–2026 formulation, which is anticipated to better match the strains expected to circulate this season. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559685":-720,"335559740":240}'&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559685":-720,"335559740":240}'&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is scheduled to meet on September 18-19, 2025. VDH anticipates that ACIP will vote on the updated COVID-19 vaccines at this meeting. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559685":-720,"335559740":240}'&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559685":-720,"335559740":240}'&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;The CDC Director, or Secretary of Health and Human Services, is then authorized to endorse or approve the recommendation with or without changes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559685":-720,"335559740":240}'&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559685":-720,"335559740":240}'&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;Patients between the ages of 18 and 64 without underlying health conditions, as well as those under 18, are encouraged to speak with their healthcare provider regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props='{"335559685":-720}'&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The first dose should be given to babies at 12 to 15 months, followed by a second at 4 to 6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e9c1df" class="body-graf"&gt;The child recovered, but years later developed &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/measles-infection-symptoms-longterm-risks-rcna138583" target="_blank"&gt;a rare, progressive brain disorder&lt;/a&gt; known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), the department said. The condition can occur in people who had measles early in life, usually around 2 to 10 years after the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-819977" class="body-graf"&gt;“This case is a painful reminder of how dangerous measles can be, especially for our most vulnerable community members,” Dr. Muntu Davis, the Los Angeles County health officer, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-533da8" class="body-graf"&gt;“Vaccination is not just about protecting yourself — it’s about protecting your family, your neighbors, and especially children who are too young to be vaccinated,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-779012" class="body-graf"&gt;About 1 in 10,000 people with measles later develop SSPE — but among those who are infected as infants, the risk is around 1 in 600, according to the Los Angeles health department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1b1ae8" class="body-graf"&gt;The condition affects the central nervous system, so people may experience seizures or lose the ability to walk before falling into a coma or vegetative state. There is no known cure or effective treatment for the disorder, and most patients die within one to three years of diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8ee997" class="body-graf"&gt;Nationally, measles vaccination rates have dipped in recent years. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm?s_cid=mm7341a3_w" target="_blank"&gt;Less than 93% of kindergartners&lt;/a&gt; in the United States received the recommended two doses during the 2023-24 school year (a rate of 95% is generally needed &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;to curb the spread&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2441d" class="body-graf"&gt;This year marked the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-cases-reach-highest-point-disease-was-eliminated-us-2000-rcna201421" target="_blank"&gt;worst outbreak &lt;/a&gt;since the U.S. eliminated the disease in 2000. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;recorded 1,454 cases&lt;/a&gt; since the start of the year, surpassing a previous record in 2019 driven by an outbreak in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6840e2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Orthodox Jewish communities in New York&lt;/a&gt; with low vaccination rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-20c73f" class="body-graf"&gt;This year’s high case count was largely fueled by an outbreak in &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/measles-outbreak-mennonites-west-texas-seminole-vaccines-rcna208284" target="_blank"&gt;a Mennonite community in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;, which also has low vaccination rates. Two unvaccinated children in the community died of measles earlier in the year, as did &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-new-mexico-resident-tests-positive-death-rcna195231" target="_blank"&gt;an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, marking the country’s first measles deaths in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-084b5b" class="body-graf"&gt;The Texas health department &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;declared an end&lt;/a&gt; to the West Texas outbreak in mid-August, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;weekly cases in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; have generally declined since then. However, there are still ongoing outbreaks — including &lt;a href="https://dhhs.utah.gov/featured-news/measles-in-utah-sept-9-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;one at a Utah high school event&lt;/a&gt; — making measles a persistent threat to unvaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f9dad" class="body-graf"&gt;Two shots of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles and typically offer lifelong protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3641be" class="body-graf"&gt;Public health experts say the challenge of getting measles under control this year has been &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-texas-rfk-jr-response-vaccines-doctors-wary-rcna194510" target="_blank"&gt;compounded by misinformation&lt;/a&gt; from Health Secretary Robert F.

Too much of it can also be harmful: Physicians in West Texas &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html" target="_blank"&gt;reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that some unvaccinated patients showed signs of liver damage from taking vitamin A in excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 21:28:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOQlREZmdXSV9nOEM1N0IzNVdfaWlMcHo3R1lUSDF0WUZJTER2YjY3aVU3d2JXbjZGdGFyQXRpR1p2SUc1N2JsZHZUX3h1MFI0RlpfZ3dTcHJ4ckdBdGZETl94YlZpeVJpajZOcUEtNU5PWXVBbUl1djE3XzR0YlNTdnk2bm5kU1pqamtKX1JxYjBzX1NBaVNFZE42TTNYNmpkbHJYQzJxTGtXNTdKejNROWlpYUdXZUROOXM1UGtvVWTSAVZBVV95cUxPOXpBV2UyWDZBWXZqNXdtWEp5LUtVeVZEaGJrOEpIVGFUdlVYcXNWZG9aTm5fR0dSQVZBeWFfdjZsQ0NyVVJCckpodmhTSm96Y2M0TFd2UQ</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州的专家警告说，潜在致命的“接吻虫”疾病正在这里和整个美国蔓延- KHOU</title><link>https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/texas/kissing-bug-disease-texas-tamu-symptoms/285-8db6d154-60cd-488f-aa83-bd9500235d76</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;UT Health and Texas A&amp;amp;M participated in a CDC study on the bugs that can spread Chagas disease, which is becoming more prevalent here and in other states.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — A new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is raising awareness that the potentially deadly &lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/kissing-bug-disease-chagas-disease-now-endemic-in-us-researchers-say/507-6557279f-b15b-434c-b2be-2bc128d9e3fd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Chagas disease &lt;/a&gt;is becoming more common in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/health/kissing-bug-cdc-warns-people-of-deadly-bug-that-is-native-to-indiana-triatominae-health-chagas-disease-spread-united-states-study-trypanosoma-cruzi/531-08b84741-e4a9-43c2-9665-039c4748a0bb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;The disease is spread by blood-sucking insects&lt;/a&gt; called triatomines, better known as &lt;a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/local/indiana/cdc-warns-deadly-kissing-bugs-can-be-found-indiana/531-c4386e51-a18a-4fad-81b5-f9acfd082745" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the "kissing bug&lt;/a&gt;" because they typically bite victims near the lips and eyes while they're sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, about 8 million people worldwide, including at least 280,000 people in the U.S. have Chagas disease. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people don't realize they have it because the symptoms mimic many other common conditions. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it isn't treated, Chagas can cause serious health problems and can even be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas is one of eight states that have reported human cases of Chagas disease.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/IDCU/disease/chagas/UT_Health_Kissing_Bug_Chagas_Guide-061918.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;UTHealth&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://kissingbug.tamu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; Texas A&amp;amp;M &lt;/a&gt;participated in a CDC study of the disease, which is already endemic in 21 countries in Central and South America. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Hamer, &lt;a href="https://kissingbug.tamu.edu/Resources/#media" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;a veterinary epidemiologist at Texas A&amp;amp;M University&lt;/a&gt;, is among the researchers saying the time is now to recognize Chagas disease as endemic in the United States, as well.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This idea that this is only a disease that's to be encountered in Latin America, it's not accurate, and it doesn't reflect the transmission that occurs locally here in the United States to people and to animals,” Hamer said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Texas, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee have reported human cases of Chagas.   &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors in most states aren't required to track or report it.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How is Chagas or kissing bug disease spread?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease typically spreads through contact with the feces of kissing bugs. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the bugs will bite and suck blood from infected animals or people. Then they become infected with the parasite. After biting, the bugs poop, and the poop has the parasite in it. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the poop gets in someone's body through a cut in the skin, or near the eyes or mouth, it can lead to an infection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDC &lt;/a&gt;says people may rub the feces into a cut, their eyes or mouth without even knowing it. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half of kissing bugs are infected with Chagas,&lt;a href="https://kissingbug.tamu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; according to Texas A&amp;amp;M.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where are kissing bugs found? &lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blood-sucking insects occur naturally in the southern half of the country and have been &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;reported in 32 U.S. states&lt;/a&gt; and Washington D.C., according to the CDC report. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/spreads/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Those states include&lt;/a&gt;: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Jersey, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bugs can live indoors, in cracks and holes of substandard housing, or in a variety of outdoor settings, including:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beneath porches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Between rocky structures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Under cement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In rock, wood, brush piles, or beneath bark&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In rodent nests or animal burrows&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In outdoor dog houses or kennels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In chicken coops or houses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms of Chagas or kissing bug disease&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease has two stages: the acute phase and the chronic phase. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the acute phase happens in the first weeks or months after getting infected. The chronic phase can last years or even for a lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms during the acute phase are usually mild and can include:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling tired&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Body aches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eyelid swelling, known as&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7660534/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; Romaña's sign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people have no symptoms during the chronic phase; however, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDC &lt;/a&gt;says 20-30% of people infected will develop "serious health problems." They include:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart issues, such as an enlarged heart, heart failure, altered heart rate or rhythm, or sudden death.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Digestive problems, such as an enlarged esophagus or colon, can lead to trouble eating or going to the bathroom.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are experiencing any symptoms, contact your healthcare provider. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is kissing bug disease treatable?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease can be treated with the use of antiparasitics, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chagas-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20356218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Chronic symptoms will have to be managed with other treatment methods. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no known cure for Chagas disease. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kissing bug in dogs&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Texas A&amp;amp;M University have found Chagas disease in dogs in many counties in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some common signs of illness in infected dogs are heart problems, stomach issues, and sometimes sudden death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many infected dogs don't have symptoms, but their daily stress and activity level, along with age, may affect how sick they get. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are working on new treatments for Chagas disease in dogs. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no vaccination that protects against Chagas disease in humans or dogs.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Types of 'kissing bugs' in Texas&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are seven species of kissing bugs in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adult kissing bugs range in size, but are usually about the size of a U.S. quarter. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most species have a characteristic band around the sides of the body that is either orange or red. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The legs of kissing bugs are long and thin; unlike similar insects, the legs are thin throughout the rounded bottom. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kissing bugs have noticeable mouthparts that appear as a large black needle attached to the head; when tucked under the body, the needle-like mouthpart is completely straight. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kissing bugs are slightly flat and have very long, thin heads.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Kissing bug nymphs (immature, young insects) are smaller than adults and range from the size of a poppy seed to almost 1 inch long. They have a ‘tear-drop’ body shape, with a pointy head.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="103" data-end="887"&gt;I used to assume late diners were just disorganized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="103" data-end="887"&gt;Then I started paying attention—on work trips to Barcelona, in New York kitchens at 10:15 p.m., at my own desk on deadline nights—and realized the story is more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="103" data-end="887"&gt;Many people who eat late aren’t chaotic at all — they’re living inside different body clocks, social rhythms, and coping strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="103" data-end="887"&gt;Psychology has language for this—chronotypes, social jetlag, self-regulation bandwidth—and once you see those patterns, the “why are you eating so late?” conversation gets a lot more compassionate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="103" data-end="887"&gt;Below are 7 traits I see repeatedly in after-9 p.m. eaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="103" data-end="887"&gt;None of them are moral grades. They’re clues—and a few are genuine advantages—about how these folks move through time, work, creativity, and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="889" data-end="944"&gt;1. They’re night-owls by chronotype, not by accident&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="945" data-end="1784"&gt;Some bodies simply hit their cognitive and physical stride later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="945" data-end="1784"&gt;If your internal clock (chronotype) runs “evening,” your alertness curve peaks when early birds are winding down, and your hunger naturally drifts later too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="945" data-end="1784"&gt;That’s not laziness — it’s biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="945" data-end="1784"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104160801100080X"&gt;Research on morningness–eveningness&lt;/a&gt; shows stable, partly genetic differences in when people &lt;em data-start="1296" data-end="1304"&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; to sleep, work, and eat. Late diners are often aligning dinner with their true wakefulness window, not fighting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="945" data-end="1784"&gt;Practically, that means a 9:30 p.m. plate may feel like someone else’s 6:30 p.m.—socially late, biologically right-on-time. If you’ve tried (and failed) to become a 6 p.m. eater, consider that you may be playing against your clock, not your willpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="945" data-end="1784"&gt;The smarter move is to build routines that respect the body you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1786" data-end="1870"&gt;2. They trade prime early-evening hours for flow, then eat when the brain lets go&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1871" data-end="2634"&gt;Another common thread: late diners often protect the 6–9 p.m. block for something that genuinely matters—deep work after the emails stop, a rehearsal, a second wind of exercise, or social time that refuels them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1871" data-end="2634"&gt;In other words, dinner is a rewarded landing, not a starting gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1871" data-end="2634"&gt;This sequencing is psychological as much as logistical. When your best concentration shows up late, you stack tasks in that window and let food follow. It can look odd from the outside, but it’s how flow states get protected in busy lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1871" data-end="2634"&gt;If this is you, consider a small, protein-forward snack around 5–6 p.m. to keep blood sugar steady while you chase the thing that needs your best brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1871" data-end="2634"&gt;Your main plate at 9:30 p.m. will feel like a calm exhale instead of a frantic raid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2636" data-end="2724"&gt;3. They’re synchronizers—choosing people over clocks (and navigating “social jetlag”)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2725" data-end="3626"&gt;Plenty of late eaters aren’t personally nocturnal; they’re scheduling to the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2725" data-end="3626"&gt;The partner’s shift ends at nine; the teenager gets home from practice at eight-thirty — friends meet after a show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2725" data-end="3626"&gt;You choose connection, and dinner slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2725" data-end="3626"&gt;Psychology calls the mismatch between biological time and social time &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334439104_Chronotype_and_Social_Jetlag_A_Self-_Critical_Review"&gt;social jetlag&lt;/a&gt; — and it’s most pronounced in evening types who live on early-bird schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2725" data-end="3626"&gt;That tug-of-war shows up at mealtimes, too. The upside: late eaters are often &lt;em data-start="3212" data-end="3232"&gt;relationship-first&lt;/em&gt;; they prioritize bonding over perfect timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2725" data-end="3626"&gt;The watch-out is chronic misalignment (always eating on your “biological midnight”) which can leave you foggier the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2725" data-end="3626"&gt;If you’re constantly dining by committee, small nudges help—morning light exposure, consistent wake times, and keeping the very late meals to truly social nights, not every night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3628" data-end="3707"&gt;4. They skew creative and novelty-seeking (and their spark turns on at dusk)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3708" data-end="4507"&gt;A fun—and often overlooked—pattern: evening types tend to show stronger creativity and comfort with novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3708" data-end="4507"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ijip.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/18.01.092.20190702-1.pdf"&gt;Several studies&lt;/a&gt; link later chronotypes with divergent thinking and idea generation, and with personality profiles that tilt a bit more toward openness and a bit less toward rigid conscientiousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3708" data-end="4507"&gt;If your spark shows up at 8:45 p.m., dinner naturally drifts because the mind is busy making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3708" data-end="4507"&gt;That doesn’t make you flaky; it makes you someone whose &lt;em data-start="4173" data-end="4185"&gt;best ideas&lt;/em&gt; happen off-peak. The trick is designing food around that gift—prep components earlier, keep a “late creative plate” on standby (soup, beans + greens, tofu you can sear in five), and land the meal without breaking the spell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3708" data-end="4507"&gt;Your life gets easier when your kitchen respects your muse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4509" data-end="4564"&gt;5. Their self-control rhythm is different—not weaker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4565" data-end="5327"&gt;By 7 p.m., lots of people are out of decision-making gas. Late eaters often budget willpower differently: they spend it on the project, the class, the rehearsal, the extra shift—and push the meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4565" data-end="5327"&gt;To an early diner, that reads like “no discipline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4565" data-end="5327"&gt;To a psychologist, it looks like an alternative allocation of self-regulation: saying yes to delayed gratification (finish the thing) and then yes to food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4565" data-end="5327"&gt;What helps is removing friction from that last step so hunger doesn’t turn into a raid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4565" data-end="5327"&gt;Think defaults: a set of three go-to late dinners, a pre-chopped veg box, or a ready grain that cooks while you shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4565" data-end="5327"&gt;You’re not changing your wiring — you’re smoothing the landing for 9:30 p.m. dinner isn’t a bag of chips but something that actually restores you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5329" data-end="5389"&gt;6. Their hunger and metabolism cues genuinely shift later&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5390" data-end="6320"&gt;Here’s where biology gets blunt: &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131%2822%2900397-7"&gt;timing changes physiology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5390" data-end="6320"&gt;In a rigorous crossover study that controlled for calories, sleep, and activity, late eating (same food, later time) increased hunger, reduced energy expenditure, and shifted fat-tissue gene expression toward storing rather than burning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5390" data-end="6320"&gt;Translation: when you push meals late—especially habitually—you may feel hungrier and burn slightly fewer calories during the day, independent of what you ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5390" data-end="6320"&gt;That doesn’t make late dinner “bad,” but it does explain why some people feel snack-y after dark or groggy the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5390" data-end="6320"&gt;Useful tweaks: pull protein and fiber earlier into the day, keep late plates lighter and closer to two hours before bed, and get bright light soon after waking to firm up your clock. Small changes can defend sleep and mood without forcing a 6 p.m. dinner you’ll never keep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6322" data-end="6369"&gt;7. They adapt to culture and city—on purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6370" data-end="7188"&gt;Finally, environment matters. In many Mediterranean and Latin cultures, late dinner is the norm; social life blooms after sunset, and the plaza fills when an American suburb goes quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6370" data-end="7188"&gt;Even within the same country, urban schedules run later than suburban ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6370" data-end="7188"&gt;Late diners are often context-savvy: they eat when their world eats. That adaptation can be deeply human (more face time, cooler temperatures, community) even if it clashes with a textbook circadian ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6370" data-end="7188"&gt;If you live in a late-eating culture or city, you can still protect health with consistency (regular dinner time, not a ping-pong), earlier daylight, and a solid lunch so dinner doesn’t turn into a midnight feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6370" data-end="7188"&gt;The point isn’t to fight your context — it’s to make it work for your body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7195" data-end="7213"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7214" data-end="8051"&gt;People who eat after 9 p.m. aren’t a monolith. Some are artists coming off a late rehearsal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7214" data-end="8051"&gt;Some are parents waiting to eat with kids after practice. Some are simply night-owls who feel most alive after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7214" data-end="8051"&gt;The thread running through these lives isn’t irresponsibility; it’s alignment—to a clock, a community, a craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7214" data-end="8051"&gt;If your plate lands late and you feel fine, you probably built systems around it: earlier light, steady sleep, not-enormous portions, and a lunch that pulls real weight. If you &lt;em data-start="7717" data-end="7724"&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; feel fine, you don’t need a personality transplant—just a few nudges toward your biology: brighter mornings, more protein by noon, and a dinner that respects both your calendar and your clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7214" data-end="8051"&gt;The goal isn’t to pass a 6 p.m. purity test — it’s to wake up clear and go to bed satisfied, whatever time your life sits down to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsr3ex000h3b79n86jgyf3@published"&gt;My younger sister “Harper” just shared with me that she and her husband are excited to be expecting a baby. She told me she was only telling our parents and a few trusted family members and asked me to help her keep the news secret until after the baby is born!&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffss94b000s3b79dk4domyr@published"&gt;I knew immediately that this was because of our older sister “Ronnie.” Ronnie and her husband have struggled with infertility for years. After 10 miscarriages, Ronnie has reached a point where she will not be in the same room with a pregnant woman or a baby if she can help it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfft8a1u001a3b792njzbkxk@published"&gt;Harper also told me that she is also going to forgo having a baby shower “out of respect for what Ronnie is going through.” I think this is insane.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfft685e00163b79l69fygvt@published"&gt;Yes, what Ronnie is dealing with is devastating for her, but I don’t think she has a right to make everyone around her sacrifice their own enjoyment and milestone events because of it. Should I tell Ronnie about Harper’s pregnancy, and tell her it’s time to suck it up and shut up?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsr3le000k3b79xrvdat9p@published"&gt;I’m not sure why Harper believes it will be any easier for Ronnie to learn about her baby after its birth as opposed to before. But Harper’s pregnancy is her business—it’s her choice who she wants to tell about it, and when. Maybe she wants to enjoy her happy news (assuming she is happy about it) for as long as possible before dealing with Ronnie’s potential feelings about it. In any case, while I know it’s an awkward situation—and it feels weird to know something important about your sister that your other sister doesn’t know—I do think you should probably leave it to Harper to share the news as she sees fit.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsr3n8000l3b79k9zllmp5@published"&gt;I realize you probably wouldn’t tell her in so many words to “suck it up and shut up.” Still, when you phrase it as her holding “the world hostage” and say that she doesn’t have the right to make Harper forgo any joy or celebration, you are overlooking the fact that Ronnie isn’t &lt;em&gt;forcing &lt;/em&gt;Harper to do anything. Obviously it’s not realistic if Ronnie expects to get through life without ever seeing pregnant people and babies. But you don’t know that that’s her plan—sometimes there are things we do to try to take care of ourselves while actively grieving that we don’t necessarily do forever.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsr3p2000m3b79mfdu6ktd@published"&gt;Right now, Ronnie is grieving. That is affecting her and her relationships and your family in many ways. It’s okay for you to feel upset or sad or frustrated about that. But Ronnie didn’t choose to experience so many losses, and the timeline of her grieving and healing is not up to you. In the meantime, she hasn’t asked Harper not to have a baby shower “out of respect” for her; she doesn’t even know about the baby.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsr3r1000n3b796vl8r8a1@published"&gt;Whether before or after the birth, your sisters are going to have to figure this out. If the secrecy right now bothers you, you can gently encourage Harper to be open with Ronnie before the baby arrives. (She might not really be “protecting” Ronnie, after all—Ronnie might be even more hurt knowing that Harper felt she couldn’t tell her about the pregnancy.) I don’t know how close your sisters are, but if Harper loves Ronnie enough to forgo a baby shower to try to protect her feelings, maybe they are close enough to talk about this and come to some sort of genuine, if inevitably complicated, understanding—one that allows them to be honest with each other, acknowledging both Harper’s happiness and Ronnie’s pain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsn81c00axw7kvovsu79ka@published"&gt;I am a happily married middle-aged woman with two girls, “Bailey” (16) and “Sera” (14). They are great sisters. They get along fine for their age, and they enjoy playing video games and reading books together. Bailey is extraordinarily patient with Sera’s anti-social nature, and they share everything together. My husband and I made the decision to homeschool them when Bailey was in first grade, and they are both ahead academically. They also have a great relationship with my husband and me, and although our circle is small, we are happy. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/01/mother-in-law-shot-childs-confidence-comparison-advice.html"&gt;However, we’re experiencing some academic drama as of late.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Led by Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a long-time vaccine skeptic, federal agencies have narrowed their recommendations on who should get COVID-19 shots, which now exclude younger healthy people without underlying health conditions as well as pregnant women. The actions have prompted medical and expert groups to make their own recommendations, while several states have issued executive orders to ease access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Perceptions vary on vaccine access&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poll of 1,084 US adults was conducted from September 5 through September 9. It revealed that 24% thought the new federal vaccine recommendations were based on facts, including 5% of Democrats and 48% of Republicans. Of the overall group, 48% thought the policy was not based on science and facts, and the rest were unsure or didn’t answer the question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about concerns for future vaccine access for children, 48% said they were very concerned, compared to 38% who weren’t worried. The answer to that question also showed a political divide, with four out of five Democrats saying they were worried, compared to one in five Republicans and half of independents. Regarding worries about their own access, 42% said they were worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollsters said the survey had a margin of error rate of 3 percentage points, rising to 6 percentage points for Republicans and Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Of these cases, 490 are neuroinvasive, meaning they are severe cases impacting the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus is the leading cause of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;mosquito-borne disease&lt;/a&gt; in the continental U.S. While it primarily infects people during mosquito season in the summer and fall, experts have warned a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/climate-change/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;warming climate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; means &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mosquito-season-getting-longer-more-disease-west-nile-virus/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;mosquito season is getting longer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, prompting greater potential for the spread of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Massachusetts recently announced two additional human cases, the state's public health commissioner Dr. Robbie Goldstein encouraged the public to stay vigilant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Infections can continue to occur until the first hard frost of the season, which is likely still many weeks away," Goldstein said in &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-health-officials-announce-additional-human-cases-of-west-nile-virus-in-massachusetts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a news release&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed West Nile cases nationwide as new data is released by ArboNET, a national arboviral surveillance system managed by CDC and state health departments. (The map below is updated bi-weekly on Tuesdays when the  latest data is released.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;West Nile virus symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A West Nile virus infection often leads to flu-like symptoms, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aches and pains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chills&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash (occasionally)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Less than about 1 in 150 people who get infected get a more serious form, and that involves the central nervous system," CBS News chief medical correspondent &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/west-nile-virus-symptoms/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Dr. Jon LaPook said last year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. In those more severe cases, "You get inflammation of the brain, and this the the membrane that lines the spinal cord, and that's a much more serious situation there." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people infected with the virus do not develop symptoms, according to the CDC, but for those who do, symptoms usually start about 2-6 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito, though in some cases, it may be up to 14 days. "It may take longer for symptoms to start for people with a weakened immune system," the agency notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no specific treatment available for West Nile virus, so health experts say it's important to focus on prevention, like the precautions Goldstein shared to reduce the risk of mosquito bites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting yourself is especially important for people who are more at risk, including the elderly and those immunocompromised, LaPook said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from UNC School of Medicine researchers, published this week in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(25)00622-1" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neuron&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, reveals a unique look at how junk food rewires the brain's memory hub—leading to risk of cognitive dysfunction. This new research opens the door to early interventions that can prevent even long-term memory loss associated with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This overactivity disrupts how the hippocampus processes &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/memory/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, even after just a few days of high fat diet. This type of diet resembles typical Western-style &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/junk+food/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;junk food&lt;/a&gt; rich in saturated fat—like cheeseburgers and fries. The discovery also showed that a protein called PKM2, which controls how brain cells use energy, plays a key role in this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We knew that diet and metabolism could affect brain health, but we didn't expect to find such a specific and vulnerable group of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain cells&lt;/a&gt;, CCK interneurons in the hippocampus, that were directly disrupted by short-term high-fat diet exposure," Song said, who is a member of the UNC Neuroscience Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What surprised us most was how quickly these cells changed their activity in response to reduced glucose availability, and how this shift alone was enough to impair memory."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Brain health study summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mouse models were placed on high-fat diet resembling fatty junk food before starting behavioral testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within 4 days of eating high-fat diet, results showed CCK interneurons in the brain's memory hub became abnormally active.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results suggest fatty junk foods can affect the brain almost immediately, well before the onset of weight gain or diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research findings also highlight how sensitive memory circuits are to diet, underscoring the importance of nutrition in maintaining brain health. A high-fat diet, rich in saturated fats, could possibly lead to an elevated risk of developing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neurodegenerative+diseases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt;, like dementia and Alzheimer's, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research also shows that restoring brain glucose levels actually calmed down overactive neurons and fixed memory problems in mice. The study found interventions like dietary modifications or pharmacological approaches may be effective in preserving brain health for obesity-related neurodegeneration. Notably, researchers discovered that dietary interventions like intermittent fasting periods following a high-fat diet were sufficient to normalize CCK interneurons and improve memory function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This work highlights how what we eat can rapidly affect &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; and how &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/early+interventions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;early interventions&lt;/a&gt;, whether through fasting or medicine, could protect memory and lower the risk of long-term cognitive problems linked to obesity and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolic+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metabolic disorders&lt;/a&gt;," said Song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the long run, such strategies could help reduce the growing burden of dementia and Alzheimer's linked to metabolic disorders, offering more holistic care that addresses both body and brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research is ongoing to further understand how these glucose-sensitive neurons disrupt brain rhythms that support memory. Researchers plan to test whether these targeted therapies could be translated into humans and how a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high-fat+diet/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high-fat diet&lt;/a&gt; could be a factor in Alzheimer's disease. Lifestyle-based interventions will also be explored, such as dietary patterns that stabilize brain glucose, to see if they offer protective benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

These signals can reveal personality traits and even early signs of mental health conditions, but human clinicians may miss them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI could provide faster, more accurate analysis, though researchers warn of bias if models aren’t trained on diverse data. With careful development, AI could transform psychological assessment, offering powerful new tools to support clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language as Data:&lt;/strong&gt; Speech patterns reveal personality and mental health clues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Advantage:&lt;/strong&gt; Models analyze subtle cues faster and more comprehensively than humans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bias Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; Fair training across diverse populations is essential for reliable use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Words are windows into the brain. The words that we choose — and how we say them — speak volumes about our personalities and even our mental health, said WashU psychologist Josh Oltmanns. “Our thoughts, feelings and behaviors are reflected in language,” he said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of subjecting people to endless batteries of tests, psychologists could gain valuable insights from samples of language. But they might need high-tech help to find the right signals in all of the chatter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) tools trained to detect tell-tale signs in speech could revolutionize psychological assessment, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Psychologists are people, and people are fallible, so even a good clinician might not always pick up on important verbal cues,” said Oltmanns, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences in Arts &amp;amp; Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. “But a properly trained computer model will catch those cues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, a psychologist could ask a client to describe their life and concerns, a standard part of an initial assessment. In addition to using their own clinical expertise, the psychologist could feed that conversation into a program designed to detect personality traits and signs of mental health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The computer program could help validate their observations or warn them about something they might have missed,” Oltmanns said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oltmanns is working with his collaborators, who are also WashU PhD students, &lt;a href="https://psych.wustl.edu/people/tu-do"&gt;Tu Do&lt;/a&gt;, Tong Li, and Tongyao Ran, to develop AI tools to help psychologists uncover these hidden cues in language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recently described the potential of such tools in the journal&lt;em&gt; Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;. Mehak Gupta, of Southern Methodist University, and Jocelyn Brickman, of Xavier University, were co-authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language can convey psychology in many ways. Word choice matters, whether in a deep conversation or a casual post on X or Facebook. Early in his career, Oltmanns studied how word choices in social media posts broadly reflected a person’s Big Five personality traits: openness to experience, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness and extraversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the way a person says words matters, too. “You can tell a lot by how a person speaks,” Oltmanns said. “Slowed speech can be a symptom of depression, while overly rapid speech is associated with anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speed is just one measure. Spoken words also vary in loudness, tone and pitch. “Speech samples have hundreds of different acoustic parameters that could be meaningful,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so much potential information buried in each conversation, psychologists have long wanted the help of computers to analyze speech. More than 20 years ago, researchers developed Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, a software program that could score people on various psychological aspects based on written text. Those tools have been refined over time, but the advent of AI opens a new world of possibilities, Oltmanns said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI programs could be far faster, more thorough and more accurate than previous computer models,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Oltmanns cautioned that AI also has risks. “It’s often trained on information on the internet, which means it can be biased,” he said. If those biases aren’t addressed, it’s possible that certain cultural differences in speech patterns could be inaccurately labeled as signs of mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid such problems with bias, AI models should be trained on diverse patient populations. To that end, Oltmanns is studying the hundreds of hours of interviews collected over the years through the SPAN Study, an ongoing investigation of more than 1,600 St. Louis adults who represent the city’s diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re particularly interested in looking at speech patterns in white and Black participants to ensure that the AI models treat each group fairly,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oltmanns sees several other important questions moving forward. It’s not clear how word choice in written language differs from word choice in speech, or how many words it takes to truly gain insights into a person’s psychology. “We have a lot of ideas and a lot of work to do,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the speed of innovation in the AI field, he hopes to find answers sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Companies are already selling AI psychological assessment tools to hospitals and clinicians, but it’s not clear to me how well they work or how thoroughly they’ve been evaluated,” Oltmanns said. “This sort of technology could be a huge advance for the field of psychology, but it has to be done carefully. We have to be smart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and speech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3c504f545d5a5a594e7c4b494f485012595849" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leah Shaffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wustl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WUSTL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Leah Shaffer – WUSTL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/25152459251343582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Large Language Models for Psychological Assessment: A Comprehensive Overview&lt;/a&gt;” by Mehak Gupta et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large Language Models for Psychological Assessment: A Comprehensive Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) are extraordinary tools demonstrating potential to improve the understanding of psychological characteristics. They provide an unprecedented opportunity to supplement self-report in psychology research and practice with scalable behavioral assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they also pose unique risks and challenges.

                    &lt;p&gt;From a tender wrapper of human life, the placenta, comes the extraction of a protein that points to a solution for something that, until now, science had no clear path toâ€”and never one so celebrated: restoring the spinal cord in people who suffered injuries and lost body movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazilian researcher Tatiana Coelho de Sampaio, PhD professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, has quietly worked with a team of biologists for the past 25 years on the repairing and multiplying power of the protein laminin, which acts on the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The studies ultimately produced the current drug polylaminin, a world first, presented on Tuesday (9) by CristÃ¡lia laboratory as capable of regenerating the spinal cord in people who suffered organ rupture in accidents of various kinds, leading to paraplegiaâ€”paralysis of the lower limbsâ€”or quadriplegiaâ€”paralysis of both lower and upper limbs.&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;During the experimental phase of the antidote, which is applied directly to the spine, patients experienced full recovery of their conditions, with no aftereffects and resuming a routine without restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

If prioritizing your heart health is one of your health goals, you likely already know what foods would get your cardiologist’s stamp of approval (&lt;a href="https://parade.com/food/what-is-stone-fruit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fruits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fruits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1353878/jocelyndelkadams/spring-vegetable-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vegetables;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, whole grains, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/plant-based-protein-lower-heart-disease-risk-by-27-percent-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plant-based proteins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;plant-based proteins&lt;/a&gt;, lean meat protein and fish) and which foods they say to eat minimally, if at all (fatty meats and ultra-processed foods).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what you drink is just as important for cardiovascular health as what you eat. According to &lt;a href="https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/utilities/our-experts/lars-sondergaard.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Lars Sondergaard, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Lars Sondergaard, MD,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;a cardiologist and the chief medical officer and divisional vice president of medical affairs for Abbott’s structural heart division, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/simple-hydration-trick" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hydration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hydration&lt;/a&gt; is crucial for heart health. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“When a person is dehydrated, their blood can become thicker and more prone to the formation of clots, which can increase the possibility of heart events. By drinking enough water, a person can help their heart pump more efficiently because it doesn’t have to work as hard to move blood,” Dr. Sondergaard explains, adding that drinking enough water may also reduce the long-term risk of developing heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/jennifer-l-wong" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Jennifer Wong, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Jennifer Wong, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist and the medical director of Non-Invasive Cardiology at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California, explains that hydration helps the circulation, allowing the heart to work more efficiently. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The type of drink you choose to stay hydrated with matters. As cardiologists explain here, there’s one beverage swap they wish more people would make to support their heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/stethoscope" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩺;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;🩺&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for Parade’s health newsletter with expert-approved tips, healthy eats, exercises, news &amp;amp; more to help you stay healthy &amp;amp; feel your best self;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP for Parade’s health newsletter with expert-approved tips, healthy eats, exercises, news &amp;amp; more to help you stay healthy &amp;amp; feel your best self&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/pill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:💊;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;💊&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Beverage Swap Cardiologists Wish More People Would Make&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fruit juice is a beverage that definitely has a health halo. Some people drink fruit juice every day—whether their drink of choice is O.J., apple juice, grapefruit juice or cranberry juice—as a way to support their immune system. And certainly fruit is beneficial for cardiovascular health. Why wouldn’t the same go for fruit juice?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While drinking fruit juice in moderation is fine, relying on it to stay hydrated can do more harm than good. Unlike water, fruit juice is often high in added sugar, which can be detrimental to heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-time-of-day-to-work-out-for-heart-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Is the Best Time of Day to Exercise if You Want to Improve Heart Health, According to a Cardiologist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Is the Best Time of Day to Exercise if You Want to Improve Heart Health, According to a Cardiologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A diet high in added sugar can negatively impact heart health by contributing to weight gain, elevated blood pressure, increased inflammation and unhealthy cholesterol levels, all of which are risk factors for heart disease,” says &lt;a href="https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/estelle-darlyse-jean-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Estelle Jean, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Estelle Jean, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a cardiologist at MedStar Health. She explains that one major reason for this is that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8730703/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:excessive sugar consumption can raise triglycerides and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;excessive sugar consumption can raise triglycerides and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; while decreasing HDL (good) cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sondergaard also says that excessive sugar is bad for the heart, explaining, “Excessive sugar intake &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36119103/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:can cause chronic inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;can cause chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in blood vessels and lead to fatty liver disease, which increases the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the negative ways too much added sugar can impact heart health, &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/added-sugars" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the American Heart Association recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the American Heart Association recommends&lt;/a&gt; limiting sugar intake to no more than 6% of calories for the entire day. For most people, that comes out to about six teaspoons of sugar. Some servings of juice &lt;a href="https://www.heartandstroke.ca/articles/the-truth-about-juice" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:have more than 30 grams of sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;have more than 30 grams of sugar&lt;/a&gt;, which is about seven teaspoons. That means one cup of juice could have more sugar than it’s recommended to consume for the entire day!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/day-of-heart-healthy-eating-according-to-a-cardiologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:'I'm a Cardiologist, and This Is What a Typical Day of Heart-Healthy Eating Looks Like for Me';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;'I'm a Cardiologist, and This Is What a Typical Day of Heart-Healthy Eating Looks Like for Me'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to hydration, nothing beats regular H20. “Beyond just reducing sugar intake, choosing water over juice offers several heart health benefits. Water helps the heart pump blood more efficiently and reduces its workload by maintaining optimal blood volume,” Dr. Sondergaard says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explains that staying hydrated with water also supports kidney function, enabling efficient removal of toxins and excess sodium, which helps regulate blood pressure. “Furthermore, water helps the body maintain a proper electrolyte balance, crucial for healthy heart rhythm and function. These factors collectively contribute to a reduced long-term risk of conditions like heart failure,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jean points out that, unlike fruit juice, water doesn’t have any calories. For those trying to maintain a healthy weight, this is another reason why it’s a healthier drink choice than fruit juice. “Replacing high-calorie, sugary juices with water contributes to weight management, reduces the risk of obesity and promotes overall cardiovascular well-being,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/relaxing-habit-harming-heart-health-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I'm a Cardiologist, and This 'Relaxing' Habit Is Actually Harming Your Heart Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;I'm a Cardiologist, and This 'Relaxing' Habit Is Actually Harming Your Heart Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Is Fruit Better for Heart Health Than Fruit Juice?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating plans scientifically known to support heart health, such as the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/976803/marysauer/what-is-dash-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/962840/marysauer/mediterranean-diet-plan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/21-day-anti-inflammatory-diet-plan-according-to-registered-dietitians" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-inflammatory diet,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-inflammatory diet, &lt;/a&gt;all include fruit. So why isn’t fruit juice seen as heart-healthy as enjoying fruit in its whole form? “While fruit juice can contain some vitamins and antioxidants, it often has less &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1316162/michelle-polizzi/high-fiber-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; and more concentrated sugar than whole fruit, which can contribute to blood sugar spikes and increased caloric intake,” Dr. Jean explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5731843/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientific research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scientific research shows&lt;/a&gt; a strong connection between fiber and heart health. A greater intake of dietary fiber can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease because it lowers LDL cholesterol and raises HDL cholesterol. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Fiber plays a role in heart health by lowering cholesterol, regulating blood sugar, and promoting feelings of fullness. In contrast, the higher sugar and lack of fiber in fruit juice can lead to rapid blood sugar spikes, increased appetite and potential weight gain, all of which negatively impact cardiovascular well-being,” Dr. Sondergaard says, explaining more benefits of eating fruit versus drinking fruit juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wong says that another benefit to consuming fruit instead of fruit juice is that it takes longer to digest, due to the fiber content. This, she explains, slows down sugar absorption so that blood sugar levels aren’t impacted as much. This is an important point because scientific research shows that maintaining stable blood sugar levels is better for heart health than experiencing blood sugar highs and lows throughout the day. Keeping blood sugar levels steady&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9562876/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:is linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; is linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It bears repeating that drinking fruit juice in moderation is perfectly fine as long as it isn’t high in added sugar. But when it comes to your primary source of hydration, nothing beats water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/foods-cardiologists-always-eat-for-heart-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: 7 Foods Cardiologists Always Eat for Heart Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: 7 Foods Cardiologists Always Eat for Heart Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/utilities/our-experts/lars-sondergaard.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Lars Sondergaard, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Lars Sondergaard, MD,&lt;/a&gt;cardiologist and the chief medical officer and divisional vice president of medical affairs for Abbott’s structural heart division&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/jennifer-l-wong" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Jennifer Wong, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Wong, MD&lt;/a&gt;, cardiologist and the medical director of Non-Invasive Cardiology at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/estelle-darlyse-jean-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Estelle Jean, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Estelle Jean, MD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; cardiologist at MedStar Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-drink-swap-for-heart-health-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Sep 11, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Health &amp;amp; Wellness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Health &amp;amp; Wellness&lt;/a&gt; section.

                                        &lt;p&gt;KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — The number of suspected Ebola cases in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/democratic-republic-of-the-congo"&gt;Congo’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; southern Kasai province have &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-ebola-kasai-outbreak-73c01a467e3f7b5e3e19abec17c65a39"&gt;more than doubled in a week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; since a new outbreak was confirmed there, Africa’s top public health agency said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspected cases have increased from 28 to 68 in recent days, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said at an online briefing. It has also spread from two to four districts while the death toll currently stands at 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local residents expressed concerns on Thursday over the outbreak, the first in Congo in three years and the province’s first in more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kasai province is a remote part of Congo with poor road networks and is more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from the nation’s capital of Kinshasa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-m23-rebels-rwanda-explainer-ba862f76078ab0a4fcd24502612ab602"&gt;fighting in eastern Congo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could complicate efforts to contain the disease, which can spread rapidly due to the proximity and density of villages and provinces, Dr. Ngashi Ngongo, a principal advisor with Africa CDC, said at the briefing.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“It was two (districts), now it is four,” Ngongo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-ebola-outbreak-a42c28f0c8c1a4d8cecca5072b392593"&gt;outbreak was announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a week ago after a pregnant woman was confirmed to have been infected in the locality of Bulapé.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization sent experts alongside Congo’s Rapid Response Team to Kasai to strengthen disease surveillance, offer treatment and monitor infection prevention and controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Central African country has a history of Ebola since 1976. The latest outbreak is the 16th in the country and the 7th in the Kasai province. A previous outbreak between 2018 and 2020 in eastern Congo killed more than 1,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Local authorities in Kasai are trying to contain the outbreak. Public movements have been curtailed and checkpoints have been set up at the main entrances to Tshikapa, the capital of the province, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emmanuel Kalonji, 37, a resident of Tshikapa, told The Associated Press that some people had fled the villages before returning. “However, given the limited resources, survival is not guaranteed,” said Kalonji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;In Bulape, people are concerned about the impact on their living conditions, said Ethienne Makashi, the local official in charge of water, hygiene and sanitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, we do have one case showing good progress, which gives a glimmer of hope for those receiving care,” said Makashi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adetayo reported from Lagos, Nigeria&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Travis Rose planned for more than a month to get her family vaccinated against COVID-19 and the flu before their September trip to Disney World. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Less than 24 hours before their Aug. 28 appointment, it was canceled without an explanation. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“No notice, just canceled,” Rose told WRAL News. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Rose said she wanted the vaccines specifically to protect her son, Aiden. The 17-year-old has autism, which the FDA considers a high-risk condition for COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; “He smells everything, and he’s constantly wanting to touch. He is very sensory-seeking, and he loves to touch his face,” she explained. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She continued, “We are going to Disney World. We’re talking about the belly of the beast as far as germs are concerned. It’s this fine line between not wanting to hide but wanting to still have quality of life and live life. Vaccines have given us the ability to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 infections in the Orlando area went from 400 cases on July 4, to more than 1,000 cases reported every week for the last three weeks of August, according to the Florida Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/fayetteville-family-covid-vaccine-hurdles-sept-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/fayetteville-family-covid-vaccine-hurdles-sept-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Travis Rose said her husband, Joshua Rose, went to a military clinic in Fayetteville to ask how to get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He was told that &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/video/coronavirus/video/doctor-s-prescription-required-for-covid-vaccine-at-pharmacies/22152769/"&gt;North Carolina law required a doctor’s note&lt;/a&gt; for the family to get their vaccines if they want them before before the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) releases updated guidance. That isn’t expected to happen until the committee’s upcoming meeting on Sept. 18.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;North Carolina is one of a handful of states with laws &lt;a href="https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/vaccines"&gt;barring pharmacists from administering COVID-19 vaccines until the ACIP releases its recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, unless someone age 18 and up has a prescription written by their doctor&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						
						
							
							
							
						
					
						
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/fayetteville-family-covid-vaccine-hurdles-sept-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/fayetteville-family-covid-vaccine-hurdles-sept-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Rose told WRAL News that she and her husband were able to get their shots with their prescriptions. The parents were told that Aiden Rose could still be vaccinated by a private doctor, but the family then ran into another issue when no private practice near them had the doses in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“In Fayetteville right now, Womack Army Medical Center did not have them, the hospitals and urgent cares did not have them, our clinic doesn’t have them. The only people that have them can’t give them, because it’s a pharmacy thing,” Travis Rose said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The family spoke to WRAL News on Thursday -- during their drive to Florida -- to express their frustration. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I did everything I was supposed to do, and we still weren’t able to protect him,” Rose said. “I don’t want my child to die. I don’t want my child to be at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The mother said she had this message to those responsible for the red tape her family was caught in. “This isn’t about politics, this is about allowing parents to protect their children," she said. "Don’t take the tools away from us that allow us to protect our kids.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip-recs/hcp/vaccine-specific/covid-19.html"&gt;ACIP releases its recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC director still needs to sign off for final approval. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Typically, the ACIP meets soon after the FDA issues its vaccine approvals. The ACIP was dissolved this summer when it typically would provide fall immunization recommendations.  The panel was not reconstituted until August.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medications taken years ago can continue to shape the human gut microbiome, according to a large-scale study from the University of Tartu Institute of Genomics.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Analyzing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stool+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stool samples&lt;/a&gt; and prescription records from over 2,500 Estonian Biobank participants in the Estonian Microbiome cohort, researchers found that the majority of drugs studied were linked to microbiome changes, with a substantial number of them also showing long-term effects detectable years after patients stopped taking them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact was not limited to antibiotics: antidepressants, beta-blockers, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/proton+pump+inhibitors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;proton pump inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;, and benzodiazepines all left microbial "fingerprints."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most microbiome studies only consider current medications, but our results show that past drug use can be just as important as it is a surprisingly strong factor in explaining individual microbiome differences," said Dr. Oliver Aasmets, lead author. This highlights that it is critical to account for drug usage history when studying links between the microbiome and disease. The research is &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00541-25" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;mSystems&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, benzodiazepines—commonly prescribed for anxiety—had microbiome effects comparable to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/broad-spectrum+antibiotics/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;broad-spectrum antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;. The results also show that drugs from the same class that might be used for the same condition, e.g. diazepam and alprazolam, may differ in how much they disrupt the microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow-up samples from a subset of participants confirmed that starting or stopping certain drugs caused predictable microbial shifts, suggesting causal effects. Despite the small sample size of the second time-point analysis, the authors were able to verify &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/long-term+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;long-term effects&lt;/a&gt; of proton pump inhibitors, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/selective+serotonin+reuptake+inhibitors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; and antibiotics, such as penicillins in combination and macrolides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a comprehensive systematic evaluation of long-term medication effects on the microbiome using real-world medical health records," said Professor Elin Org, corresponding author. "We hope this encourages researchers and clinicians to factor in medication history when interpreting microbiome data."&lt;/p&gt;

The research, which tracked participants from an earlier clinical trial, suggests that the combination of the psychedelic substance with psychotherapy can lead to lasting improvements in mental health and overall well-being. The findings were published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1556/2054.2025.00461"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychedelic Studies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin is the primary psychoactive compound found in certain species of mushrooms, often referred to as “magic mushrooms.” When ingested, it can produce profound alterations in perception, mood, and thought. In recent years, researchers have been investigating its potential as a therapeutic tool when administered in a controlled clinical setting alongside psychological support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rationale for this line of research stems from the limitations of existing treatments for major depressive disorder. While many people benefit from conventional antidepressants and psychotherapy, a substantial portion do not achieve lasting remission, and medications often come with undesirable side effects and require daily, long-term use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychedelic-assisted therapy represents a different treatment model, one where a small number of high-intensity experiences might catalyze durable psychological changes. This new study was conducted to understand the longevity of the effects observed in an earlier, promising trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Alan Davis, an associate professor and director of the Center for Psychedelic Drug Research and Education at The Ohio State University, sought to determine if the initial antidepressant effects would hold up over a much longer period. Davis co-led the original 2021 trial at Johns Hopkins University, and this follow-up represents a collaborative effort between researchers at both institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation was designed as a long-term extension of a clinical trial first published in 2021. That initial study involved 24 adults with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The participants were divided into two groups: one that received the treatment immediately and another that was placed on a wait-list before receiving the same treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The therapeutic protocol was intensive, involving approximately 13 hours of psychotherapy in addition to two separate sessions where participants received a dose of psilocybin. The original findings were significant, showing a large and rapid reduction in depression symptoms for the participants, with about half reporting a complete remission from their depression that lasted for up to one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new follow-up, conducted an average of five years after the original treatment, the researchers contacted all 24 of the initial participants. Of those, 18 enrolled and completed the follow-up assessments. This process involved a series of online questionnaires designed to measure symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as any functional impairment in their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also underwent a depression rating assessment administered by a clinician and took part in in-depth interviews. These interviews were intended to capture a more nuanced understanding of their experiences and life changes since the trial concluded, going beyond what numerical scores alone could convey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that 67% of the original participants were in remission from their depression. This percentage was slightly higher than the 58% who were in remission at the one-year follow-up point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure their analysis was robust, the scientists took a conservative approach when handling the data for the six individuals who did not participate in the long-term follow-up. They made the assumption that these participants had experienced a complete relapse and that their depression symptoms had returned to their pre-treatment levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even controlling for those baseline estimates from the people who didn’t participate in the long-term follow-up, we still see a very large and significant reduction in depression symptoms,” said Davis, who also holds faculty positions in internal medicine and psychology at Ohio State. “That was really exciting for us because this showed that the number of participants still in complete remission from their depression had gone up slightly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that these lasting improvements were not solely the product of the psilocybin therapy sessions from five years earlier. The reality of the participants’ lives was more complex. Through the interviews, the researchers learned that only three of the 18 follow-up participants had not received any other form of depression-related treatment in the intervening years. The others had engaged in various forms of support, including taking antidepressant medications, undergoing traditional psychotherapy, or trying other treatments like ketamine or psychedelics on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the qualitative data provided important context for these decisions. Many participants described a fundamental shift in their relationship with depression after the trial. Before undergoing psilocybin-assisted therapy, they often felt their depression was a debilitating and all-encompassing condition that prevented them from engaging with life. After the treatment, even if symptoms sometimes returned, they perceived their depression as more situational and manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants reported a greater capacity for positive emotions and enthusiasm. Davis explained that these shifts appeared to lead to important changes in how they related to their depressive experiences. This newfound perspective may have made other forms of therapy more effective or made navigating difficult periods less impairing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Five years later, most people continued to view this treatment as safe, meaningful, important, and something that catalyzed an ongoing betterment of their life,” said Davis, who co-led the 2021 trial at Johns Hopkins University. “It’s important for us to understand the details of what comes after treatment. I think this is a sign that regardless of what the outcomes are, their lives were improved because they participated in something like this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some participants who had tried using psychedelics on their own reported that the experiences were not as helpful without the supportive framework provided by the clinical trial, reinforcing the idea that the therapeutic context is a vital component of the treatment’s success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding safety, 11 of the participants reported no negative effects since the trial. A few recalled feeling unprepared for the heightened emotional sensitivity they experienced after the treatment, while others noted that the process of weaning off their previous medications before the trial was difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledge several limitations of their work. The small sample size of the original trial means that the findings need to be interpreted with caution and require replication in larger studies. Because the study was a long-term follow-up without a continuing control group, it is not possible to definitively attribute all the observed benefits to the psilocybin-assisted therapy, especially since most participants sought other forms of treatment during the five-year period. It is also difficult to know how natural fluctuations in mood and life circumstances may have influenced the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should aim to include larger and more diverse groups of participants, including individuals with a high risk for suicide, who were excluded from this trial. Despite these limitations, this study provides a first look at the potential for psilocybin-assisted therapy to produce durable, long-term positive effects for people with major depressive disorder. The findings suggest the treatment may not be a simple cure but rather a catalyst that helps people re-engage with their lives and other therapeutic processes, ultimately leading to sustained improvements in functioning and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1556/2054.2025.00461"&gt;Five-year outcomes of psilocybin-assisted therapy for Major Depressive Disorder&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Alan K.

&lt;p&gt;Chicago health officials released a health alert about leptospirosis cases in the city after numerous infections were reported and at least one person died. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contagious bacterial disease has been found in at least four recent cases, the Chicago Department of Public Health told NBC Chicago, with one of those cases resulting in a death. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"All four of the most recent cases, including the patient who died, had either direct contact with animal urine or droppings (primarily rats) or indirect contact through yard work or gardening," the department said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDPH had recently issued a Health Alert Network alert about leptospirosis earlier this week alerting healthcare providers in the city of the recent cases to "let them know to test patients who may be displaying compatible symptoms." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"&gt;What is leptospirosis?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leptospirosis is a disease that affects many &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/pets/index.html"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt;, including dogs, and people and can be found in contaminated water or soil, according to the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/about/index.html"&gt; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The bacteria can survive in contaminated water or soil for weeks to months," the CDC reports.&lt;/p&gt;
			
	
&lt;p&gt;If left untreated in humans, the disease can lead to kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, trouble breathing and even death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the symptoms? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms in humans include: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Chills&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Body or muscle aches&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Vomiting or nausea&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Yellowed skin and eyes (jaundice)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Red eyes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Stomach pain&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms in dogs and other animals: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lethargy&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Increased thirst&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amcny.org/pet_health_library/vomiting/"&gt;Vomiting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amcny.org/pet_health_library/loss-of-appetite/"&gt;Loss of appetite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amcny.org/pet_health_library/does-my-pet-have-a-fever/"&gt;Fever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Jaundice (yellow discoloration of skin)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Discolored urine (dark yellow to orange)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Joint or muscle pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to note, however, that many animals will show no signs of infection at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people, the disease can take anywhere from two to 30 days to start showing symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDC warns it could occur in two phases: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the first phase, people may have fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, or diarrhea. The person may feel better for a while but become ill again.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Some people may suffer a more severe second phase with kidney or liver failure, or inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illness can last from a few days to several weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"&gt;How can you prevent in?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDPH recommends you: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid contact with floodwater and do not eat food contaminated with floodwater&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Reduce rodent populations:
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report sightings or suspicions of rodents to 311&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use a secure lid for trash and compost bins.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Where possible, seal entry points to prevent rats from entering your yard, and reduce standing debris, tall grass, and other items around your yard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Clean up animal urine or feces appropriately by wearing rubber or plastic gloves, cleaning thoroughly with disinfectant, and washing your hands afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;If doing yardwork/gardening or standing in water:
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cover wounds/scratches/abrasions with waterproof bandages if doing yardwork/gardening or standing in water&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Wear waterproof gloves and closed toe shoes or rubber boots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Talk to your veterinarian about leptospirosis vaccination if you have a pet dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The science behind Dr. Patrick’s claims&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patrick, who completed her postdoctoral fellowship at Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute and currently serves as founder of FoundMyFitness, has &lt;a href="https://www.a4m.com/rhonda-patrick.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.a4m.com/rhonda-patrick.html" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;built her reputation&lt;/a&gt; on translating complex scientific research into actionable health insights. Her academic credentials include published research in journals such as &lt;em&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;FASEB Journal&lt;/em&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4566436/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4566436/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;extensive work&lt;/a&gt; on aging, nutrition, and disease prevention.&lt;a href="https://www.a4m.com/rhonda-patrick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.a4m.com/rhonda-patrick.html" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Patrick described the routine as sustainable intensity exercise where “you’re not really having a conversation while you’re doing it,” but it’s “far from all-out” effort.&lt;a href="https://nakednutrition.com/blogs/fitness/the-norwegian-4-4-hiit-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://nakednutrition.com/blogs/fitness/the-norwegian-4-4-hiit-protocol" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The total workout, including warm-up and cool-down, takes roughly 30-40 minutes and needs to be performed only once or twice per week.&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/1fcbykh/programs_to_work_up_to_doing_4x4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/1fcbykh/programs_to_work_up_to_doing_4x4/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="1"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who followed a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180108090132.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180108090132.htm" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;structured exercise program&lt;/a&gt; that included the Norwegian 4×4 protocol once weekly showed remarkable improvements: an 18% increase in maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 max) and a more than 25% improvement in left ventricular compliance, effectively reversing structural heart changes by approximately 20 years.&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180108090132.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180108090132.htm" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we age, our hearts get smaller and stiffer,” Patrick said during her Diary of a CEO interview. “After those two years of 5 to 6 hours of physical exercise every single week, their hearts looked 20 years younger in terms of structure.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to the protocol’s anti-aging effects is its impact on &lt;a href="https://www.icthealth.org/news/vo2max-from-a-smartwatch-is-it-a-new-longevity-biomarker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.icthealth.org/news/vo2max-from-a-smartwatch-is-it-a-new-longevity-biomarker" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt;, the maximum amount of oxygen your body can utilize during exercise. &lt;a href="https://quatuormd.ca/en/vo2-max-not-just-for-athletes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://quatuormd.ca/en/vo2-max-not-just-for-athletes/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;Research consistently shows&lt;/a&gt; VO2 max as one of the strongest predictors of longevity and cardiovascular health.&lt;a href="https://icthealth.org/news/vo2max-from-a-smartwatch-is-it-a-new-longevity-biomarker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://icthealth.org/news/vo2max-from-a-smartwatch-is-it-a-new-longevity-biomarker" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2707428" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2707428" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;A major study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; involving over 122,000 participants found individuals with the lowest VO2 max values had a fourfold increased risk of mortality compared to those with the highest values. Simply moving from the bottom 25th percentile to the 25th-50th percentile was associated with a 50% reduction in all-cause mortality.&lt;a href="https://peterattiamd.com/how-does-vo2-max-correlate-with-longevity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://peterattiamd.com/how-does-vo2-max-correlate-with-longevity/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="3"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Performing the exercise safely&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patrick emphasized the Norweigan 4×4 protocol requires progressive implementation. “It’s not easy, you can’t just start doing it right out the gate,” she said. “You want to kind of work your way up to that… work your way up as you do it one week, two weeks, you know, a month later, two months later.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For business professionals seeking efficient health optimization, the Norwegian 4×4 protocol offers significant advantages. Its time-efficient nature, requiring less than an hour total including warm-up and cool-down, makes it practical for busy schedules while delivering outsized returns on investment in terms of cardiovascular health and longevity. And the research suggests this minimal time commitment could provide protection against heart failure, particularly the type known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which becomes increasingly common with age and sedentary lifestyle.&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29311053/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29311053/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

There have been suggestions, not well-supported by evidence, that mosquitoes may prefer certain blood types or particularly "sweet blood". Overall, it appears that mosquitoes are indeed attracted to certain individuals over others, sometimes choosing the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/always-getting-bitten-by-mosquitos-this-contributor-to-your-skin-s-odor-could-be-why-65805" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;same target night after night&lt;/a&gt; despite plenty of available meals, and part of the answer is to do with odor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, researchers recruited 465 participants to study the phenomenon in a more natural setting than a lab: a music festival in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the festival, the team asked volunteers to fill in questionnaires about their hygiene, diet, and activity at the festival. This included how much alcohol they had consumed, and their sleeping arrangements for their stay (including whether they were alone), as well as the usual demographic questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, it was time to set some mosquitoes loose and see which of the participants the insects were most attracted to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mosquito attraction was measured using a custom designed setup: a transparent cage with perforations where female &lt;em&gt;Anopheles &lt;/em&gt;mosquitoes were offered a choice between a sugar-feeder and the participants arm," the team explains in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mosquitoes could only smell, not bite, the participant’s arm. Attraction was quantified through video imaging, measuring arm landings relative to total landings. Mosquito attraction was correlated with questionnaire responses and skin microbiota profiles collected from forearm skin swabs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CvrvJAd-20Y?&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team discovered that mosquitoes were less attracted to festival-goers who wore sunscreen, and who had skipped their usual shower routine. As well as this, they found that individuals with more &lt;em&gt;Streptococci &lt;/em&gt;on their skin were more attractive to the insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more important was whether the participants had drunk beer, and whether they had slept alone. Those that had drunk beer specifically – blood alcohol levels did not have a noticeable effect – were significantly more attractive to mosquitoes, as well as those who had not slept alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The general picture that emerges from our study suggests that a sober life-style – abstaining from drugs and alcohol, sleeping alone, and applying sunscreen regularly – lowers one’s chances of getting bitten by mosquitoes," the team explains. "While we found no evidence supporting popular myths such as blood type influencing bite frequency, we were unable to assess the existence of so-called ‘sweet blood.’ Ultimately, enjoy the next festival or camping trip as you like – but it seems mosquitoes may have a soft spot for those making less responsible choices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though an interesting study, looking at a fairly natural environment, the team notes a few caveats, including that the participants were a self-selecting group of music-loving science enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While our findings are intriguing, there may be other contributing factors yet to be identified," the team adds. "Further research is certainly needed before we suggest rejecting a beer solely to avoid mosquito bites."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you do enjoy a beer, consider slathering yourself up in sunscreen first, or maybe forgoing your wash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is posted to pre-print server &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.21.671470v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 16:25:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxNNFpOQ3F6N1UwaXM1R2JZVkpLLUEzX0NJejdDWm00ZlNrMzhNeHJkcU1zRk9ha2dqQzBCWnE4UmQweVh6WWN4RU5ORXk3VXM2Y3FEZW9PWTUxNEJ1YlV0N0RLS0FlQk45VTV1b0FrZENoRDlIMTJIaW5wMW1ndG9WcWcwU29oRXZlOHM1c1ljYVozOFktUmRXUDdUejJETnhwdGYtTFdpUURlSzBWWlAyQWNVRFlQM09vVFN3U2xUUUJnU1dQ</guid></item><item><title>彻底改变囊性纤维化治疗的科学家赢得了着名的拉斯克奖- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/11/lasker-award-cycstic-fibrosis-treatments/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three scientists who revolutionized the treatment of cystic fibrosis and prolonged the lifespan of patients with the deadly disease have won the Lasker Award, one of the most prestigious awards in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vertex Pharmaceuticals researcher Paul Negulescu, former Vertex researcher Jesús (Tito) González, and University of Iowa professor Michael Welsh, will share the $250,000 prize. The Lasker DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award, as it’s formally known, is given for a “major advance that improves the lives of thousands of people,” according to the Lasker Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not only gratifying and rewarding,” said Negulescu, a senior vice president at Vertex. “Our hope is that our work can serve as lessons for other research.”&lt;/p&gt;

It's one of this year's Lasker Awards — biomedical-research prizes established in 1945 that are often called the "American Nobels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="e6c52c7c-7a5a-43ec-81b5-f9a5e5d75c83-2"&gt;"It's super gratifying," said González, who was formerly the senior director of biology at Vertex Therapeutics. "It's very rare to actually have something [in medical research] that goes all the way to patients and is made widely available, and to have such a dramatic effect," he told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="65fcd175-3452-4688-b236-43a13312199f"&gt;The treatment, called Trikafta, extends the lifespans of people with CF by decades — and patients who start treatment in childhood or adolescence are expected to live near-average lifespans. By comparison, when the disease was first discovered in the 1930s, most patients died in early childhood. And even in the 2010s, before Trikafta's approval in 2019, about half of CF patients died before age 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today, the estimated median age of survival for persons with cystic fibrosis who were born between 2020 and 2024 and have access to treatment is 65 years," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winshipcancer.emory.edu/profiles/sorscher-eric.php" target="_blank" data-url="https://winshipcancer.emory.edu/profiles/sorscher-eric.php" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Eric Sorscher&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Emory University wrote in an essay about the award, published in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcibr2510197?query=RP" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcibr2510197?query=RP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "Available projections suggest that health and longevity may increase further as modulators begin to be administered at younger ages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lasker Award "also brings back a lot of great memories and it really warms your heart when you think of all the people you've worked with, and all the time and effort," González added.

When functional, the gene enables cells to make tubes inside their membranes that charged particles called ions can flow through. That, in turn, lets water flow as it should through tissues and helps organs, like the lungs, intestines and pancreas, do their jobs properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in CF, the CFTR gene malfunctions, causing thick, sticky mucus to clog the linings of these organs. The mucus gums up airways, raising the risk of dangerous infections and scarring in the lungs, and it can cause issues with digestion, the absorption of nutrients and insulin signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lab research conducted by Welsh in the 1980s and 1990s helped lay the groundwork for Trikafta, a drug that addresses the molecular cause of most types of CF. Working with cells from the airways of people with the disease, Welsh and colleagues unraveled the "physiological consequences" of the most common genetic error seen in people with CF, González explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work demonstrated that this defect in the CFTR gene — known as delta-f508 — makes it so that charged particles can't pass through the tubes in the cell membrane as easily. The mutation means that the tubes never actually reach the surface of the cell, so the ions get stuck. In various experiments that involved cooling down the cells as they grew in lab dishes, Welsh showed that the tube could be made to reach the cell surface and thus better transport ions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as a postdoctoral scholar in the lab of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/16384-nobel-prize-chemistry-list.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/16384-nobel-prize-chemistry-list.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nobel-winner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Roger Tsien, González co-invented a system that could accurately track the flow of ions across cell membranes in real time. The initial inspiration behind the system was to study how the brain worked, as ions moving across membranes enable brain cells to fire, he said. But the system was also perfect for testing potential new CF drugs designed to fix the ion-transport issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This allowed us to screen tens of thousands of compounds a day," González said. "While electrophysiology, the standard method at the time for studying ion channels in depth, was very slow, just a handful a day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers refined the process to hunt for CF drugs at biotech company Aurora Biosciences, which was later acquired by Vertex Pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negulescu, also at Aurora and later Vertex, led the project of screening molecules to see how they affected ion transport. His team looked for "potentiators," which boost the flow of ions, and "correctors," which help move the tubes into the right position in the cell membrane. This effort led to the approval of several iterations of CF drugs — in 2012, 2015 and 2018 — before finally leading to Trikafta's approval in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they started getting data back from the earliest human trials of their first-generation drug, González recalled "that was super exciting because that it became very real. It's like, 'Oh wow, this is not just theory; this is actually working in patients.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trikafta combines three drugs to effectively treat most people with CF. Its use has reduced the number of lung transplants and hospitalizations for infection among people with the disease, and improved patients' quality of life, according to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/combined-triple-drug-therapy-for-cystic-fibrosis/" target="_blank" data-url="https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/combined-triple-drug-therapy-for-cystic-fibrosis/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement from the Lasker Awards&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Welsh, González, and Negulescu’s achievements are affording people with CF the chance to thrive now and to plan vibrant futures," the statement says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="a3b3c0ad-c394-48a7-be3f-fe6d606d7e84"&gt;Two additional Lasker Awards were awarded this year, including one for basic research and another for special achievements in medical science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former prize went to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/goerlich" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/goerlich" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dirk Görlich&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences in Germany and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/14812/steven-mcknight.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/14812/steven-mcknight.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Steven McKnight&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the lab study, THC exposure led to a nine percent increase in rates of embryos containing an improper number of chromosomes, and more than doubled the rate of abnormalities in spindles, structures that assist in chromosomal development. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers caveated their results, noting that people undergoing IVF are taking large amounts of hormones, so their findings may not be generalizable to the larger public.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Samples used in the study came from females under the age of 40 and it is unclear as to when they consumed THC products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most chromosomally abnormal embryos will either fail to implant in the uterus or will result in miscarriage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In more rare instances, the abnormal embryos may result in chromosomal disorders, such as Down syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, exposing immature egg cells to THC disrupted their ability to sort chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An abnormality in the way an egg cell's chromosomes line up during cell division is linked with miscarriage and birth defects such as Edwards syndrome, which causes deadly growth delays, and Patau syndrome, which causes physical and developmental abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Autism Research Institute notes that previous research has also found that prenatal exposure to cannabis may increase likelihood of autism, with animal studies suggesting THC can lead to genetic mutations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, chromosomal abnormalities and defects are tied to autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These effects were seen in the recent study with people who had THC in their systems from marijuana products while they were pregnant or undergoing IVF.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the back of their investigation, the authors of the recent study conclude: 'These findings underscore the need for increased awareness and caution among people with ovaries, particularly those undergoing fertility treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our study highlights the importance of informing patients about the potential risks associated with cannabis consumption and provides a basis for regulatory bodies, medical professional societies, and public health organizations to establish recommendations and guidelines regarding cannabis consumption during fertility treatment.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63011-2#Sec2"&gt;were published&lt;/a&gt; in the medical journal, Nature Communications.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the analysis of IVF patients, just 60 percent of embryos in the THC-positive group had the proper number of chromosomes, compared to 67 percent in the THC-negative group. These 'abnormal' results are pictured above&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has also looked at how marijuana can harm fertility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 study led by the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-2bdd3930-8e58-11f0-ac7c-e970e0b4e8cc"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, Irvine (UCI), found adolescent female mice exposed to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive chemical in the drug, had 50 percent fewer healthy ovarian follicles than the control group by the time they were adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers believe the body's endocannabinoid system - which is stimulated when marijuana is used - damages follicles or causes them to activate too quickly, depleting them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With marijuana use now commonplace among teens across America, researchers fear many young women are unknowingly damaging their likelihood of having a child in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the study was on mice, separate research has shown that pregnant women who use cannabis are at a greater risk of birth defects, miscarriages and stillbirths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has found that marijuana may damage semen quality and affect male fertility too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a 2018 study out of Tulane and the University of Washington, researchers looked at samples from men in Washington, where the drug has been legal for recreational use since 2012, and compared it with their cannabis consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that men who had consumed cannabis in their lifetime were more likely to have abnormally-shaped sperm and lower concentrations of sperm compared to men who had never used the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 16:01:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNb0hRYy1uNTNRVHVSMnBVX3pMY3ZMWHFiYmNTT2VyVGVFY3hJSGZUZ3RrTU5sRG5venF6aFlhNlRaZzFUYTZYSm5ObXhuZm9ZTnVFQnA4bWhRMkI2czdVR1BlR2psOURjZXBHaVFSSTlJVkRUQVV2THM3aDFBZHJnc000MktETkI2YnVYVDRvNmZuTE5YUGhMRzNONHhjX3ZtV3fSAacBQVVfeXFMTzI1QU9CZ01tR3d2OTQyeThKdTAzX2NlQi01QTJCUFNZcHdLV3E4MjdleWVWOVk2cnlvUEo3dEUwamNkWVRUbTk3V2dvQzFmNWZOc0JSVXhfOXVGb3F4RkNGZEV4S0NvTlZoMXduZGtqM2FPQmRXcVYxc0hYTDA5dnZpTlJqWDRrUDZJQWZST3A1SDVTQ3JvNXBEQWp0Wk8xdUM5MUZqZ2M</guid></item><item><title>杀死查理的天使明星Farrah Fawcett的“禁忌”癌症的新警报飙升-医生发现谁有风险-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15088799/women-cervical-anal-cancer-farrah-fawcett.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thousands of women could be offered screening for a little-discussed &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-9616f680-8f23-11f0-b861-4f2c49e4320e"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, after a major study revealed survivors of another cancer face elevated risks years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research focused on anal cancer, which remains rare but is rising fastest in older women – and found that those who have previously had cervical cancer are at significantly higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Current guidelines recommend screening for certain high-risk groups, including people with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hiv_aids/index.html" id="mol-96191960-8f23-11f0-b861-4f2c49e4320e"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and women with a history of vulvar cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors say a crucial group is being overlooked, as cases of the disease continue to climb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates are rising most sharply among women over 65, with cases in this age group increasing by around 4 per cent a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the most famous cases was American actress Farrah Fawcett – a 1970s TV icon best known for Charlie's Angels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She revealed her anal cancer diagnosis in 2006, which at the time sparked tabloid speculation about her sex life because of the stigma surrounding the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fawcett died in 2009, aged 62, after the cancer spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One of the most famous cases was American actress Farrah Fawcett – a 1970s TV icon best known for Charlie’s Angels (pictured with her long-term partner, actor Ryan O’Neal)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fawcett revealed her cancer diagnosis in 2006, which at the time sparked tabloid speculation about her sex life. Fawcett died in 2009, aged 62, after the cancer spread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the trend continues, oncologists at the US National Cancer Institute warn numbers could double in less than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now researchers led by Dr Haluk Damgacioglu, an expert in disease modelling at the Medical University of South Carolina, say women who have survived cervical cancer should also be considered high risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In their study, more than 85,500 women diagnosed with cervical cancer between 1975 and 2021 were tracked for an average of nine years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those already diagnosed with anal cancer, or who developed it within two months of their cervical cancer diagnosis, were excluded from the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the remaining women, 64 went on to develop anal cancer – with risk climbing sharply 10 to 15 years after treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 60 per cent of cases in women aged 65 to 74 occurred more than 15 years after their cervical cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The threshold currently used to justify screening programmes is 17 cases per 100,000 people. In this age group, the study found rates of 17.6 per 100,000 – high enough to qualify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the journal JAMA Network Open, Dr Damgacioglu said: 'These findings support the need for age-based and duration-based anal cancer screening recommendations for women with a cervical cancer history.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;HPV is thought to be behind at least 90 per cent of anal cancers and 99 per cent of cervical cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'In summary, this study provides critical data to inform anal cancer screening recommendations among a high-risk population of women with a history of cervical cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team is now calling for further research to weigh up the risks and benefits of screening, and to determine the best age to introduce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cervical cancer itself remains a major killer, with around two women dying from it every day in the UK.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the trend continues, oncologists at the US National Cancer Institute warn numbers could double in less than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now researchers led by Dr Haluk Damgacioglu, an expert in disease modelling at the Medical University of South Carolina, say women who have survived cervical cancer should also be considered high risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In their study, more than 85,500 women diagnosed with cervical cancer between 1975 and 2021 were tracked for an average of nine years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those already diagnosed with anal cancer, or who developed it within two months of their cervical cancer diagnosis, were excluded from the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the remaining women, 64 went on to develop anal cancer – with risk climbing sharply 10 to 15 years after treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 60 per cent of cases in women aged 65 to 74 occurred more than 15 years after their cervical cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The threshold currently used to justify screening programmes is 17 cases per 100,000 people. In this age group, the study found rates of 17.6 per 100,000 – high enough to qualify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the journal JAMA Network Open, Dr Damgacioglu said: 'These findings support the need for age-based and duration-based anal cancer screening recommendations for women with a cervical cancer history.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;HPV is thought to be behind at least 90 per cent of anal cancers and 99 per cent of cervical cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'In summary, this study provides critical data to inform anal cancer screening recommendations among a high-risk population of women with a history of cervical cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team is now calling for further research to weigh up the risks and benefits of screening, and to determine the best age to introduce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cervical cancer itself remains a major killer, with around two women dying from it every day in the UK. It is often dubbed a 'silent killer' because symptoms can be mistaken for less serious problems such as period pain and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If caught early, the chance of surviving at least five years after an anal cancer diagnosis is around 95 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this plummets to just 15 per cent if the disease is detected late, once it has spread to other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, women aged 25 to 49 are invited for cervical screening – more commonly known as a smear test – at their GP surgery every three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet uptake remains low, with only about 70 per cent of eligible women, or 4.6million, attending their scheduled test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 1,600 people are diagnosed with anal cancer in the UK every year, the majority of them women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Desperate Housewives star Marcia Cross was famously diagnosed with anal cancer in 2017, which she attributes to a strain of HPV that may have also caused her husband's throat cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the most high-profile cases in the US was Desperate Housewives actress Marcia Cross, who revealed her diagnosis in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms include bleeding from the anus, pain in or around the area, small lumps felt around the anus, changes in bowel habits, and passing mucus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These issues can also be caused by more common conditions such as haemorrhoids or anal fissures – but persistent or unusual symptoms should always be checked by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both cervical and anal cancers are linked to infection with high-risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), which is transmitted through sexual contact.

&lt;p&gt;HARRISBURG, Pa. (WKBN) — The Pennsylvania Gaming Commission announced that a viral disease has infected deer in both Mercer and Lawrence counties.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;According to a press release, epizootic hemorrhagic disease or EHD has been investigated as the cause of death for some deer in southwestern and southeastern Pennsylvania, where test results are pending.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency said that the disease is spread to deer when they are bitten by infected midges, small insects often called “no-see-ums.” The disease surfaces in late summer and remains a threat to deer until temperatures drop and the midges die off, usually at the first hard frost. EHD can leave an impact on the infected deer population, according to the press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="nojq1euy" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;EHD has also been detected in Muddy Creek Township in Butler County and Mill Creek Township in Erie County. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="nojq1euy" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The bluetongue virus (BT) is another disease that causes similar problems. Deer that contract this contract clinical issues seven days after infection and die soon after. Symptoms of BT include swelling of the face or neck, loss of appetite, lethargy, weakness, lameness, respiratory distress, fever, and excessive salivation. The agency said that some deer survive the initial infection and can develop chronic signs like hoof cracks or overgrowth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania Game Commission said that there are currently no treatments for EHD or BT infections in wild deer, and for diseases spread by insects, wildlife management options are limited. The agency said that local deer populations often rebound within two to three years following an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;No Pennsylvania elk have contracted EHD or BT, and they are less susceptible to infection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both diseases can affect domestic livestock. To report sick livestock, call the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture at 717-772-2852.&lt;/p&gt;

But when he began to experience urinary symptoms, he went to see his doctor in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that appointment, his doctor noticed that Riddleston, who hails from the English city of Chelmsford, had a “hard, irregular prostate,” according to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15068947/Father-three-59-dismissed-backache-unaware-sign-stage-four-prostate-cancer.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daily Mail.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Daily Mail.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“Nurses, healthcare professionals, we think we're immune to everything that we treat our patients for, so I didn't even think of cancer at first,” Riddleston said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He underwent a PSA test; Short for Prostate-Specific Antigen, it’s a protein made by the prostate, and high levels could indicate cancer, the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/24615-psa-test" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic &lt;/a&gt;explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of cyclists.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he received the news that he had high PSA levels, “I knew things weren't going to be very good,” he said. “I just felt like vomiting all over my computer, it was a really visceral, violent reaction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Futher tests confirmed that Riddleston had &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-like-us-prostate-cancer-caregiving-spotlight-11760337" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:prostate cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; — and after he was referred to London’s The Royal Marsden Hospital, he was given the devastating news that his cancer was stage four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riddleston said that, due to his healthcare background, he “knows too much” — which he admits is “not helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The healthcare professionals that look after me are amazing, and I don't need to, but I sit there and make suggestions,” he said. “It gives me an element of control and they humor me along the way, which I'm very grateful for. The thing is, you never are in control with cancer and that's one of the most frightening aspects for me – it's panic stations really.

&lt;p id="153d7dcd-5f74-4062-96bb-91f4baffe74b"&gt;The widely used acne medicine Accutane could be used to treat male infertility, a small study hints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For men with infertility caused by extremely low sperm counts or a complete lack of sperm, the only medical option is to undergo surgery to collect sperm directly from the testicles to then use for in vitro fertilization (IVF). But this is a significant surgery that involves discomfort; potential risks, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/procedures/microtese" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/procedures/microtese" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;such as infection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; and a prolonged recovery period. Moreover, the surgery only yields sperm about half the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="153d7dcd-5f74-4062-96bb-91f4baffe74b-2"&gt;Now, researchers are exploring an alternative: isotretinoin, better known as Accutane, a drug that has been used for decades to treat severe acne.

This molecule, a derivative of vitamin A, is essential for the normal development of sperm cells. It controls the development of immature germ cells into mature sperm cells and facilitates the release of mature sperm into the seminiferous tubules within the testes. This link led scientists to test isotretinoin — a compound that mimics natural retinoic acid — as a potential way to jump-start sperm production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers enrolled 26 men with nonobstructive azoospermia — a condition in which there is no sperm in the ejaculate due to a problem with sperm production — and four men with cryptozoospermia, in which extremely low numbers of sperm are present in the ejaculate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the participants took 20 milligrams of isotretinoin twice daily for at least six months. Their blood values, hormone levels and semen were closely monitored at several time points during the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 30 men in the study, 11 began producing motile sperm — sperm that swim efficiently — in their ejaculate. This enabled these men and their partners to start IVF without the need for surgical sperm collection. This treatment-responsive group included all four men with cryptozoospermia and seven men who had previously shown no sperm at all in their ejaculate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the remaining men who still lacked sperm in their ejaculate after treatment, doctors had to use surgery to collect sperm for IVF. But after isotretinoin, the procedure took far less time — 63 minutes, on average, compared with 105 minutes before treatment. (The report didn't note exactly why the surgery was more efficient after Accutane.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time the study was published, nine IVF cycles had been carried out with sperm collected after isotretinoin treatment, leading to multiple healthy embryos, some ongoing pregnancies and one live birth so far, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment wasn't free of side effects, however. All 30 men developed dry skin and chapped lips, and about half reported feeling irritable after the treatment. Some also had rashes and elevations in their cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Because isotretinoin can these levels and liver function, patients would need regular blood tests during treatment, Houman said. When people take Accutane for acne, doctors recommend periodic blood tests, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(13)03489-4/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(13)03489-4/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;although they don't agree on how frequently&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; these tests should be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Importantly, we do not yet know the optimal dose, duration, or long-term safety of isotretinoin in men seeking fertility," he said. "Another drawback is that response rates are unknown, and many men may not benefit at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until data from larger studies is available, isotretinoin shouldn't be used to treat male infertility outside of clinical trials, Houman cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women, isotretinoin can be taken safely outside of pregnancy, but during pregnancy, it's considered highly dangerous because it &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a681043.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a681043.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;can cause severe birth defects&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This risk is so significant that the drug carries a black box warning and strict contraception requirements to adhere to when taking the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="066a4c59-8ca7-4c15-b885-e2722d2109ca"&gt;"In men, the situation is different," Houman said. The drug doesn't appear to damage sperm DNA or pose risks to reproductive partners or the resulting children. "In fact, this new research suggests it may have a paradoxical benefit by enhancing sperm production in certain men." This highlights "the very different biological contexts" between the male and female reproductive systems, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the researchers hope to figure out which male infertility patients are most likely to benefit from isotretinoin; how to fine-tune the timing and dosage of the treatment; and whether the drug can improve sperm quality and fertility outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The possibility that a simple course of oral medication could restore sperm production for some men "would represent a monumental shift in how we approach male infertility", Levine said. "It offers a new layer of hope — not just the hope of finding sperm, but the hope of restoring a natural biological function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-3NzeXPy96M9afiLovbDe7F-U2yd4jYFKJueHu6fEPZpq4DWwW0KRu6h" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-3NzeXPy96M9afiLovbDe7F-U2yd4jYFKJueHu6fEPZpq4DWwW0KRu6h slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
