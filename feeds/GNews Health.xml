&lt;p&gt;It’s common for PCPs to recommend between 1,000 to 2,000 IUs per day of vitamin D3, Stadler said. Holick thinks adults should be on a higher amount than this, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typically, I recommend adults should be on minimum 2,000 units per day — and most I recommend 5,000 units a day because you want to get your blood level, in my opinion, of [vitamin D] between 40 and 60 ng/mL, [but] up to 100 is perfectly safe,” said Holick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you get the go-ahead from your doctor, you can buy vitamin D supplements online or in stores like CVS and Walgreens. You’ll likely find vitamin D3 and vitamin D2 on the shelves, but vitamin D3 is more readily available and tends to be more recommended. Holick said vitamin D2 is perfectly acceptable, too, and is often preferred by vegans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s better to get &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; nutrients directly from food, that isn’t easy or potentially even possible with vitamin D. Oily fish, milk and orange juice are all good for increasing vitamin D levels, but can’t do so to the level necessary, said Holick. The same goes for the sun, which also carries a risk of skin cancer with too much exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holick said he recommends vitamin D supplementation to all of his patients, friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You cannot get enough from your diet. You aren’t able to get enough from sunlight, unless you’re a ... hunter-gatherer, so vitamin D supplementation is essential,” Holick said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults and people with darker skin are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency, Stadler added. But, once again, it’s advisable for most people to take a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;

The state came down with a record-breaking 71,123 cases the week ending Dec. 20 — the highest since flu became a reportable disease in 2004, officials said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 15,000 of those lab-confirmed flu cases &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://nyshc.health.ny.gov/web/nyapd/new-york-state-flu-tracker"&gt;were on Long Island&lt;/a&gt; during that period — 7,924 in Nassau and 7,571 in Suffolk, state data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing the highest number of flu cases ever recorded in a single week,” State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in a statement, adding that the agency is monitoring hospital bed capacity “to better understand hospitalization trends and to guide any necessary response related to impacts from respiratory viral infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State hospitalizations &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/respiratory_viruses/activity/2025-2026/docs/current_respiratory_report.pdf"&gt;due to influenza went up 63% &lt;/a&gt;over the last two reporting weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="/news/health/flu-cases-ahead-uwosj55h"&gt;Experts have warned of a likely severe flu season&lt;/a&gt; attributed to low vaccination rates and a surprise variant that emerged after the vaccine was formulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statewide, there have been 189,312 positive flu cases reported since October, including &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://nyshc.health.ny.gov/web/nyapd/new-york-state-flu-tracker"&gt;20,415 in Nassau and 18,109 in Suffolk&lt;/a&gt;. Infectious disease doctors have said lab-confirmed tests represent only a portion of actual flu cases because many people who are sick may not seek medical help or get tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospitalization rate in Suffolk County more than doubled over the last two weeks, from 8.79 to 20.38 per 100,000 people, while Nassau County's increased from 15.4 to 23.2 per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials noted that reporting of flu cases has gone up in recent years due to increased testing but "the record number underscores that this season is impacting more people than in other recent years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDonald advised all eligible New Yorkers to get vaccinated against the flu, and stay home when they get sick. People at higher risk of severe flu, such as the elderly and those with compromised immune systems, can benefit from antiviral medication if it is administered within 48 hours of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the current flu vaccine is not a perfect match to the circulating strain, it is still worth getting, said Dr. Bruce Farber, chief of public health and epidemiology at Northwell Health, during a briefing last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[The flu vaccine] is very good at preventing hospitalizations and deaths,” he said. “It's not as good at preventing flu per se, but if you get flu, more likely than not, it will be a lot less severe than if you are not vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-and-influenza-vaccination-data"&gt;25% of eligible New Yorkers&lt;/a&gt; have received flu shots as of Dec. 24, including 20% in Suffolk County and 24% in Nassau County. The state Health Department and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended the flu vaccine for everyone over the age of 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisa L.

Their work also points to a potential strategy for lowering that risk.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining modern laboratory techniques with previously published data from vaccinated individuals, the team uncovered a two-stage immune response. In this process, the vaccine activates one type of immune cell, which then stimulates another. Together, these immune reactions drive inflammation that can damage heart muscle cells and set off additional inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccines Remain Highly Safe and Effective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings come despite the fact that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been given billions of times worldwide and continue to show an excellent safety record, said Joseph Wu, MD, PhD, director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The mRNA vaccines have done a tremendous job mitigating the COVID pandemic," said Wu, the Simon H. Stertzer, MD, Professor and a professor of medicine and of radiology. "Without these vaccines, more people would have gotten sick, more people would have had severe effects and more people would have died."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mRNA vaccines are considered a major advance because they can be developed quickly, adjusted as viruses change, and tailored to target very different pathogens. Still, as with any medical intervention, reactions are not identical for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Vaccine-Associated Myocarditis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One uncommon but documented side effect of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines is myocarditis, which refers to inflammation of the heart muscle. Symptoms can include chest pain, shortness of breath, fever and heart palpitations. These symptoms occur without a viral infection and typically appear within one to three days after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most affected individuals show elevated levels of cardiac troponin in their blood, a widely used marker of heart muscle injury. (Cardiac troponin is normally found exclusively in the heart muscle. When found circulating in blood, it indicates damage to heart muscle cells.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition occurs in roughly one out of every 140,000 people after a first vaccine dose and increases to about one in 32,000 after a second dose. Rates are highest among males age 30 and younger, where it affects about one in 16,750 vaccine recipients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outcomes Are Usually Mild and Temporary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu emphasized that the majority of myocarditis cases linked to vaccination resolve quickly, with heart function either fully preserved or restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's not a heart attack in the traditional sense," he said. "There's no blockage of blood vessels as found in most common heart attacks. When symptoms are mild and the inflammation hasn't caused structural damage to the heart, we just observe these patients to make sure they recover."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rare instances, however, severe inflammation can cause serious injury, leading to hospitalization, intensive care treatment or death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But COVID's worse," Wu said. He noted that a COVID-19 infection is about 10 times more likely to cause myocarditis than an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, in addition to the many other risks posed by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Closer Look at the Immune Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu is a senior author of the study, publisded Dec. 10 in &lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, along with Masataka Nishiga, MD, PhD, a former Stanford postdoctoral scholar now at The Ohio State University. The study's lead author is Xu Cao, PhD, also a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Medical scientists are quite aware that COVID itself can cause myocarditis," Wu said. "To a lesser extent, so can the mRNA vaccines. The question is, why?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suspects Identified&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer that question, the team analyzed blood samples from vaccinated individuals, including some who developed myocarditis. When they compared these samples with those from people who did not develop heart inflammation, two proteins stood out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Two proteins, named CXCL10 and IFN-gamma, popped up. We think these two are the major drivers of myocarditis," Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both CXCL10 and IFN-gamma are cytokines, signaling molecules that immune cells use to communicate and coordinate their activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Immune Cells Interact After Vaccination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers grew human immune cells called macrophages in laboratory dishes and exposed them to mRNA vaccines. Macrophages act as early responders in immune defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After exposure, the macrophages released multiple cytokines, with especially high levels of CXCL10. Their behavior closely matched immune responses previously documented in vaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When T cells were added to the system, either directly or by exposing them to fluid from the macrophage cultures, the T cells began producing large amounts of IFN-gamma. In contrast, T cells exposed to the vaccine alone did not show this spike. These findings showed that macrophages primarily produce CXCL10, while T cells are the main source of IFN-gamma following vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Cytokines Affect the Heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether these cytokines directly harm the heart, the team vaccinated young male mice and observed increased cardiac troponin levels, indicating heart muscle injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also found that immune cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, had entered heart tissue. Neutrophils are short-lived immune cells that respond aggressively to threats and are a major component of pus. Similar immune cell infiltration is seen in people who develop myocarditis after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blocking CXCL10 and IFN-gamma reduced the number of these immune cells entering the heart and limited damage to healthy tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also detected increased levels of adhesion molecules in heart blood vessels. These molecules help immune cells latch onto vessel walls, making it easier for them to move into heart tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings confirmed that CXCL10 and IFN-gamma directly contribute to heart injury. Blocking them preserved much of the immune response to vaccination while lowering signs of heart damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing Human Heart Tissue Models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu's lab specializes in converting human skin or blood cells into stem-like cells that can become heart muscle cells, immune cells and blood vessel cells. These cells can be assembled into small, beating clusters that mimic aspects of heart function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When these cardiac spheroids were exposed to CXCL10 and IFN-gamma collected from vaccinated immune cells, markers of heart stress rose sharply. Using inhibitors to block the cytokines reduced this damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures of heart function, including contraction strength and beating rhythm, were impaired by the cytokines but improved once the signaling was blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saved by a Soybean&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu suspected that a widely available dietary compound might help protect the heart. Since myocarditis is more common in males and estrogen has anti-inflammatory effects, he revisited genistein, a soy-derived compound his team had studied previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2022 study published in Cell, the researchers showed that genistein has anti-inflammatory properties and can counter marijuana-related damage to blood vessels and heart tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Genistein is only weakly absorbed when taken orally," Wu said. "Nobody ever overdosed on tofu."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing Genistein's Protective Effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team repeated their experiments while pre-treating cells, cardiac spheroids and mice (the latter by oral administration of large quantities) with genistein. This treatment reduced much of the heart damage caused by either mRNA vaccination or the CXCL10 and IFN-gamma combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form of genistein used in the study was more purified and concentrated than supplements commonly sold in stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's reasonable to believe that the mRNA-vaccine-induced inflammatory response may extend to other organs," Wu said. "We and others have seen some evidence of this in lung, liver and kidney. It's possible that genistein may also reverse these changes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Implications Beyond COVID Vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heightened cytokine signaling may be a broader feature of mRNA vaccines. IFN-gamma, in particular, plays a critical role in defending the body against foreign DNA and RNA, including viral genetic material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Your body needs these cytokines to ward off viruses. It's essential to immune response but can become toxic in large amounts," Wu said. Excessive IFN-gamma can lead to myocarditis-like symptoms and breakdown of heart muscle proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This risk is not limited to COVID vaccines alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Other vaccines can cause myocarditis and inflammatory problems, but the symptoms tend to be more diffuse," Wu said. "Plus, mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines' risks have received intense public scrutiny and media coverage. If you get chest pains from a COVID vaccine you go to the hospital to get checked out, and if the serum troponin is positive, then you get diagnosed with myocarditis. If you get achy muscles or joints from a flu vaccine, you just blow it off."&lt;/p&gt;

This includes multivitamins containing iron, so keep prenatal vitamins locked and away from children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Hepatitis A, B, C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hepatitis A, B, C, it’s easy as 1, 2, 3 to contract - which is why these viruses are so prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Hepatitis C most certainly can kill you, it is not preventable in the same way as Hepatitis A and B, which are vaccine-preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organization estimates that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-8398509/More-SEVEN-MILLION-people-infected-coronavirus-world.html"&gt;254 million people are chronic carriers of the virus&lt;/a&gt;, with 1.2 million new infections annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hepatitis B is spread through bodily fluids and can survive on surfaces for up to seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acute hepatitis B infection can appear months after contracting the virus, with symptoms of jaundice, loss of appetite, fever, and liver pain in the right upper abdomen, but many patients have no outward symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hepatitis B results in an estimated 1.1 million annual deaths worldwide, many of which are due to hepatocellular carcinoma. Cancer is a leading cause of human death worldwide, and almost all primary liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma caused by hepatitis B and C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15363201/Health-officials-reassure-parents-hepatitis-B-vaccine-safe-US-changes-recommendation-infancy-jab.html"&gt;changed its recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, no longer recommending Hepatitis B in infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The CDC no longer recommends Hepatitis B vaccines to infants - experts believe the decision will result in the death of infants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lilies look and smell beautiful - but ingesting even a small amount could cause your throat to swell, blocking the airway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ninety percent of children under the age of one who contract Hepatitis B will have chronic infection, with one fourth dying from the disease. Vaccine experts have stated there was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-10931075/Experts-question-CDCs-approval-COVID-vaccines-5s.html"&gt;no scientific basis for the CDC’s decision&lt;/a&gt;, and children will die because of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles and whooping cough are other vaccine-preventable diseases that have &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-11463677/Nearly-40million-children-missed-measles-vaccine-year-amid-lockdowns-anti-vaxx-movement.html"&gt;made recent comebacks in the US due to waning vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;. These diseases, once major causes of death in children, are wholly preventable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Houseplants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Assume anything with ‘lily’ in it is poisonous: calla lily, peace lily, lily of the valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are traditional funeral flowers in many cultures, which is oddly appropriate, and they do smell lovely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lily of the valley contains cardiac glycosides, while calla and peace lilies contain calcium oxalate crystals that cause pain and swelling of the mouth and throat with ingestion, blocking the airway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avoid eating these flowers, using particular care around children and pets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other poisonous houseplants include tulips, irises, and rhododendrons - know what you are bringing home in your bouquet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Potatoes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the marketing ploy of the ‘best by’ date may cause unnecessary food waste, some foods do expire with consequences beyond a funny taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For instance, potatoes - especially those stored for long periods, that turn green or begin sprouting - can produce solanine, a neurotoxic poison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Don't be tempted to eat those green, sprouting potatoes - they could be poisonous&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As many as half of American homes are missing a life-saving carbon monoxide detector&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 1952, there was a solanine poison outbreak reported in North Korea due to stored potatoes during wartime, which affected hundreds and killed dozens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sprouted and green potatoes should serve as a flashing red light to avoid eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Carbon monoxide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While smoke detectors are present in more than 90 percent of our homes, carbon monoxide detectors are missing in up to half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CO is a gas that is inhaled, passes through the lung tissue to the blood, and then blocks oxygen from getting to your vital organs, causing stroke and swift death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only 14 US states require hotels to have CO detectors, and this does not apply to home rentals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even daycares aren’t federally required to have them, leading to the 2022 poisoning of 24 children at Happy Smile Learning Center in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Twenty-eight states now require CO detectors in homes, but many of these laws only apply to newly built homes, which is why more than half of US homes do not have CO detectors, meaning you probably don’t have one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Sex&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Did you know Casanova was a real person?

			&lt;p&gt;This year, the International  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="179116" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Diabetes&lt;/a&gt; Federation (IDF) &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(25)00263-3"&gt;officially recognized&lt;/a&gt; a fifth form of diabetes, after decades of controversy. It's now urging other health authorities, like the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="179116" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_5_diabetes"&gt;Type 5 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; is rarely discussed or researched, and yet it is thought to impact up to 25 million people worldwide, especially those in low- and middle-income nations where access to medical care is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40200-025-01674-w"&gt;limited&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was first described in 1955 in Jamaica, then forgotten about for many years. Even once it was acknowledged by the WHO in the 1980s, the diagnosis created controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For going on seven decades, scientists have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-8587(25)00252-9"&gt;debated&lt;/a&gt; whether type 5 diabetes exists at all, and in 1999, WHO withdrew the classification due to a lack of evidence. To this day, there is no agreement on how to diagnose type 5 diabetes or how to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-treatment-may-cure-severe-type-1-diabetes-study-finds"&gt;&lt;b&gt;New Treatment May Cure Severe Type 1 Diabetes, Study Finds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike type 1, 2, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24953-type-3c-diabetes"&gt;3c&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/type-5-diabetes-is-a-newly-recognised-disease-here-are-all-the-types-of-diabetes-you-need-to-know-about-256262"&gt;gestational diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, type 5 diabetes is not linked to obesity, lifestyle, pregnancy, or the immune system. Instead, it seems to stem from malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously known as &lt;a href="https://idf.org/about-diabetes/types-of-diabetes/type-5-diabetes/"&gt;malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus&lt;/a&gt; (MRDM), this form of diabetes is commonly misdiagnosed as other types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, because insulin resistance does not seem to be the primary cause of type 5 diabetes, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/after-60-years-diabetes-drug-found-to-unexpectedly-affect-the-brain"&gt;existing treatments&lt;/a&gt; may not help. In fact, they &lt;a href="https://idf.org/about-diabetes/types-of-diabetes/type-5-diabetes/"&gt;may even harm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the clip below for a summary of the announcement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-people-with-diabetes-could-unknowingly-have-type-1-5"&gt;specific types of diabetes&lt;/a&gt; someone has is crucial to providing the right treatment," Craig Beall, a diabetes researcher at the University of Exeter, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/type-5-diabetes-is-a-newly-recognised-disease-here-are-all-the-types-of-diabetes-you-need-to-know-about-256262"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years now, Meredith Hawkins, an endocrinologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine's Global Diabetes Institute, has &lt;a href="https://montefioreeinstein.org/news/2025/04/24/type-5-diabetes-long-awaited-designation-deadly-illness"&gt;called for global recognition&lt;/a&gt; of type 5 diabetes, which typically impacts people in Asia and Africa who are experiencing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-true-reason-for-so-much-famine-in-the-world-is-probably-not-what-you-think"&gt;severe food insecurity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Malnutrition-related diabetes is more common than tuberculosis and nearly as common as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hiv" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73049" data-postid="179116" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;/ &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hiv" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73049" data-postid="179116" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt;, but the lack of an official name has hindered efforts to diagnose patients or find effective therapies," Hawkins &lt;a href="https://montefioreeinstein.org/news/2025/04/08/einstein-research-leads-designation-new-type-diabetes"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm hopeful that this formal recognition as type 5 diabetes will lead to progress against this long-neglected disease that severely debilitates people and is often fatal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179175" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179175" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/T5D_pancreas_642.jpg" alt="Diabetes Pancreas" class="size-full wp-image-179175" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/T5D_pancreas_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/T5D_pancreas_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179175" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The pancreas produces insulin, which helps cells absorb glucose from the blood.

Either way, it's all tied up in whether the condition is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-8587(25)00252-9"&gt;properly diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; and recognized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a formal name and recognition, it's challenging to fund research, and without further evidence, it's impossible to know enough about a condition to formulate a standard diagnosis or to say how many people it affects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the IDF &lt;a href="https://idf.org/news/new-type-5-diabetes-working-group/"&gt;established&lt;/a&gt; a type 5 diabetes working group, with Hawkins as chair, to develop formal diagnostic criteria and therapeutic guidelines for type 5 diabetes; establish a global research registry; and create training for healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinct metabolic profile of type 5 diabetes means treating doctors need to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(25)00263-3"&gt;tread a fine line&lt;/a&gt; when managing patients' insulin levels.&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with type 5 diabetes might only need minimal amounts of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-diabetes-treatment-may-deliver-insulin-through-a-skin-cream"&gt;supplementary insulin&lt;/a&gt; or require alternative approaches to stimulate insulin secretion, to avoid insulin levels plummeting or spiking dangerously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183307" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183307" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DiabetesDevelopsAfterChildhoodMalnutrition-642x351.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-183307 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DiabetesDevelopsAfterChildhoodMalnutrition-642x351.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DiabetesDevelopsAfterChildhoodMalnutrition-1200x657.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DiabetesDevelopsAfterChildhoodMalnutrition-768x420.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DiabetesDevelopsAfterChildhoodMalnutrition-1536x840.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DiabetesDevelopsAfterChildhoodMalnutrition-2048x1121.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DiabetesDevelopsAfterChildhoodMalnutrition-600x328.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183307" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Undernutrition in infancy and early childhood can lead to diabetes.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Scientists are updating their view of how drugs like Adderall and Ritalin help children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder stay on task.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The latest evidence is a study of thousands of brain scans of adolescents that confirms earlier hints that stimulant drugs have little direct impact on brain networks that control attention.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead, the drugs appear to activate networks involved in alertness and the anticipation of pleasure, scientists &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01373-X" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We think it's a combination of both arousal and reward, that kind of one-two punch, that really helps kids with ADHD when they take this medication," says &lt;a href="https://neurology.wustl.edu/people/benjamin-kay-md-phd/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Benjamin Kay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the study's lead author.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The results, along with those of smaller studies, support a "mindset shift about what stimulants are doing for people," says Peter Manza, a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new research analyzed data from the &lt;a href="https://abcdstudy.org/about/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a federally funded effort that includes brain scans of nearly 12,000 children. About 4% of these kids had ADHD when they entered the study, and nearly half of those were on a prescription stimulant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;About &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/stimulant-adhd-medications-work-differently-than-thought/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;3.5 million children&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. take an ADHD medication, and the number is rising.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Medication and brain networks&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The brain scan data included a type of MRI that measures brain activity when a person is at rest. That allowed Kay and a team of scientists to see which brain areas were becoming more active in response to the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kay expected to find lots of activity in areas that let a person control what they pay attention to.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What I actually found was that those were the parts of the brain that were least affected," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead, the drugs were stimulating areas that help people stay awake and alert, and areas that anticipate a pleasurable reward.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This double effect seems to occur because stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall boost levels of two different brain chemicals, says Dr. Nico Dosenbach, the paper's senior author and a professor at Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The first chemical is norepinephrine, which prepares the body and brain for action.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study found that this "fight or flight" response counteracts the usual cognitive declines associated with sleep deprivation on cognitive performance. Lack of sleep is a problem for many adolescents, but especially those with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The second brain chemical is dopamine, which plays an important role in the brain's reward system. And a boost in dopamine levels may help children with ADHD feel more positive about mundane tasks like homework.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Usually, the brain's expectation is, "this is going to be terrible, this is going to be boring," Dosenbach says. "Dopamine can make you more tolerant because you are feeling a slight, low-level reward."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's still too soon to know whether that's what's going on, Manza says. But he agrees that stimulants are doing something in the brain that helps kids with ADHD do things like homework.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They don't find math problems very interesting, but after a dose of Ritalin it might seem more interesting to them," he says, "and so they're willing to persist and finish the task."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Brain scans before drugs?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new study's findings shouldn't undermine clinicians' confidence in the effectiveness of stimulants for ADHD, Kay says. But they do suggest that it's important to rule out factors like sleep deprivation before turning to medication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This was a really personal paper for me because I prescribe these drugs all the time," Kay says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The results also suggest that brain scans might eventually offer a way to know whether a child is likely to benefit from drug treatment, Manza says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Stimulants don't work for everyone," he says, "so we need to better target the individuals who need them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;MRI scans could even offer a better way to diagnose ADHD someday, Manza says.

																			&lt;p class="tagline"&gt;Rebuild lost muscle with these easy standing moves that fire up your lower body.&lt;/p&gt;
												
																			
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;One unpleasant fact of life? As you age, your body naturally loses muscle through a process known as sarcopenia. It’s impossible to stop this age-related decline, but you can slow it down significantly. How so? You can compensate for this loss by adding the right &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-exercises-real-world-strength-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;strength exercises&lt;/a&gt; to your workout routine. It’s never too late to start, and with consistency, you can achieve real results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke with &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://dreugenelipov.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopAIoegg4PtlCVIMEbrr1R9RR9fJynEgAGNHaR63gP1VnnkN-Cx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Eugene Lipov, MD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chronic pain specialist, board-certified anesthesiologist, and published author on pain, stress physiology, and recovery, who recommends certain &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-standing-exercises-strengthen-back-after-45/" target="_blank"&gt;standing exercises&lt;/a&gt; that will activate your legs, core, and stabilizers. Dr. Lipov has spent much of his career studying how &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-exercises-reverse-muscle-aging-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;, inflammation, and the nervous system impact physical performance. With consistency, this regimen will &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-exercises-rebuild-lost-muscle-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;rebuild muscle&lt;/a&gt; quicker than weight training after 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am best known for my published work on the stellate ganglion block (SGB) and its role in regulating the sympathetic nervous system in PTSD, chronic pain, and stress-related conditions. That same nervous-system science applies directly to muscle loss after 50,” Dr. Lipov tells us. “Rebuilding muscle at this age is not just about lifting heavier weights—it’s about restoring proper neural activation, reducing inflammation, and choosing movements that the aging body can safely recover from.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Standing Exercises Effectively Rebuild Muscle After 50&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Lipov, “Research consistently shows that aging is accompanied by neuromuscular inefficiency, reduced motor unit recruitment, and increased sympathetic nervous system activation.”&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing standing exercises helps counteract this by activating multiple muscle groups at the same time. This form of training also improves neural signaling between your muscles and brain, decreases joint compression compared to heavy machine lifts, and reduces stress responses that interfere with muscle regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This leads to better muscle activation with lower physical stress, which is critical after 50,” Dr. Lipov tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you reach 50, your muscles typically lose their efficient firing patterns. That’s where standing exercises come in clutch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This form of training reconnects muscles to the nervous system, improving timing, sequencing, and load-sharing so no single muscle is forced to compensate for others. This kind of coordination is essential for safe, confident movement,” explains &lt;b&gt;Esther Gokhale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;Founder and Creator of the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://gokhalemethod.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Gokhale Method&lt;/a&gt;, Posture Expert, Pain Specialist at Gokhale Method. “Standing exercises use axial loading, ground-reaction forces, and natural joint stacking. This is how humans evolved to build and maintain strength. Many machines and isolated gym lifts bypass these mechanisms, strengthening individual muscles while depriving bones, fascia, and connective tissue of the load they need to stay healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“From a medical perspective, this movement restores one of the most important neuromuscular patterns for aging adults. It strengthens the quadriceps, glutes, and core while retraining balance and coordination—key factors in preventing falls. Unlike leg machines, it activates the nervous system in a functional, real-world way,” Dr. Lipov explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin seated at the front of a sturdy chair, feet under your knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lean forward just a bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to stand up without using your knees, hands, or additional support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use control to slowly sit back down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="standing-resistance-band-rows" class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Standing Resistance Band Rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JP2xq33lNF0?si=dooEw8oU3pqjwh0g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bands create progressive resistance without joint overload. Standing rows improve upper-back strength, posture, and spinal stability—areas that frequently weaken due to age-related postural changes. In my clinical experience treating chronic pain patients, this exercise reduces neck and shoulder strain while rebuilding muscle safely,” Dr. Lipov points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;​​Begin by anchoring a resistance band to a sturdy pole at chest level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, facing the anchor point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the handles with both hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows and pull the band toward your body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your shoulder blades together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your arms back to the start position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="lunges" class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lunges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lunges challenge unilateral strength, balance, and proprioception,” Dr. Lipov explains. “Aging reduces our ability to stabilize on one leg, which directly contributes to injury risk. By restoring this capacity, lunges stimulate more muscle fibers than seated leg exercises and improve nervous-system coordination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin by standing tall with your feet parallel and hip-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step one foot forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring your hands to your hips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage your core as you bend your knees, lowering to form 90-degree bends in both legs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your upper body straight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your front heel and the ball of your back foot to rise back up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="standing-overhead-press" class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Standing Overhead Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When performed standing, overhead pressing activates the shoulders, arms, core, and lower body simultaneously. This whole-body demand improves motor unit recruitment—something that declines with age—and supports spinal health when done with appropriate resistance,” Dr. Lipov says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand in the middle of a resistance band, feet hip-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold one end of the band in each hand at shoulder level, palms facing forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activate your core and maintain a tall chest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press both hands overhead until your arms are completely extended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use control as you lower the bands back to shoulder height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/30-minute-walk-burns-more-calories-than-jogging-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; is a simple yet powerful cardio exercise that works wonders for your lower body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Walking is the movement pattern around which the human body was built. Humans evolved as endurance walkers, spending hours each day moving upright over long distances while carrying light loads,” Gokhale explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When walking with proper form, the movement strengthens your hamstrings, glutes, calves, deep spinal muscles, and hip stabilizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unlike gym exercises that isolate muscles, walking trains them together: repetitively, rhythmically, and under body weight. It also gently stretches tissues that modern life shortens, such as hip flexors and the front of the torso,” Gokhale tells us. “Done properly, walking absorbs shock instead of jarring the joints, making it one of the most effective—and overlooked—ways to maintain muscle, coordination, and resilience after 50.”&lt;/p&gt;

For real. Sit with the recollection. Let your mind’s eye wander around the scene. See if you can feel a spark of the joy or hope you felt at the time. Let a minute pass. Maybe two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you played along with this experiment, you are physically different now than you were a few minutes ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When you began to reminisce, brain cells dormant just seconds before began firing chemicals at one another. That action triggered regions of your brain involved in processing emotions, which is why you may have re-experienced some feelings you did at the time of the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chemical and electrical signals shot out to the rest of your body. If you were stressed before you began this exercise, your heart rate probably slowed and stabilized as levels of cortisol and other stress hormones decreased in your blood. If you were already calm, your heart rate may have quickened with excitement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In either case, regions of the brain that light up when you get a reward jittered with dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The memory changed you. But by pulling this memory to mind, neuroscientist Steve Ramirez says, you also changed the memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some elements of the memory heightened in importance.

But when stressed or depressed, mice show no preference. That’s how Ramirez and Liu’s lonely mouse acted initially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But when the scientists activated neurons associated with the memory of hanging out with other mice, the mouse’s behavior suddenly changed. It enthusiastically slurped the sweet water. Remembering better times had changed its behavior to resemble that of a healthy mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14514" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:paper was published;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;paper was published&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 in the prestigious journal Nature.

As it was going through the review process, Liu died suddenly at the age of 37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Grief, Ramirez writes, is not so different from memory: “Both endure across the entire lifespan, forever changing us, helping us to decide what matters most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ramirez, now 37, opened his own lab at Boston University in 2017. In the years since, memory researchers have made impressive strides:&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36577400/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:restoring memories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; &lt;u&gt;restoring memories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lost&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa5542" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to amnesia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; &lt;u&gt;to amnesia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, activating a memory while&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4169316/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:suppressing the emotions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; &lt;u&gt;suppressing the emotions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; attached to it,&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(15)00711-4.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:detaching the emotional reaction;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; &lt;u&gt;detaching the emotional reaction&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to one memory and&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0389-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:attaching it to another;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; &lt;u&gt;attaching it to another&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The tools now exist to erase whole events and corresponding emotions from mouse brains, or to artificially jump-start memories and all the feelings that go with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But there is no expectation in the research community that laser-wielding doctors will one day artificially reshape human patients’ memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For one, these experiments are possible only with mice that have been genetically modified to have brain cells that light up when exposed to lasers. Genetically altering a human in this manner, researchers interviewed for this story said, is neither ethical nor practical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s also not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We don’t need to generate technophobic fears of a digital future where our memories will be distorted — our memories can already be distorted very effectively by nondigital means,” memory scientists Ciara Greene and Gillian Murphy wrote in “Memory Lane: The Perfectly Imperfect Ways We Remember,” &lt;a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691257099/memory-lane?srsltid=AfmBOopgQ1Ds304dqO-W0DN2aHn-VtF3qetQAzYfm9Bz1vWnitX5Kr50" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published earlier this year;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;published earlier this year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Humans are suggestible creatures with extremely pliable memories. Armed with little more than a few leading questions, researchers have found that most&lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/news/podcasts/speaking-of-psychology/memory-manipulated" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:humans can be easily manipulated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; &lt;u&gt;humans can be easily manipulated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into believing that they did or saw something they didn’t.

But, he said, any tool in existence can be used to harm or help, and he’d rather make well-intended progress than none at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The idea of memory manipulation, to me, makes sense if we have an ethically bounded goal, and that ethically bounded goal is to restore health and nourish human well being,” he said. “Exercise is an antidote for the brain, and social enrichment is an antidote [and] a good night's sleep is an antidote. What if toggling with memories in a therapeutic manner can also be an antidote?

For real. Sit with the recollection. Let your mind’s eye wander around the scene. See if you can feel a spark of the joy or hope you felt at the time. Let a minute pass. Maybe two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you played along with this experiment, you are physically different now than you were a few minutes ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you began to reminisce, brain cells dormant just seconds before began firing chemicals at one another. That action triggered regions of your brain involved in processing emotions, which is why you may have re-experienced some feelings you did at the time of the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemical and electrical signals shot out to the rest of your body. If you were stressed before you began this exercise, your heart rate probably slowed and stabilized as levels of cortisol and other stress hormones decreased in your blood. If you were already calm, your heart rate may have quickened with excitement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In either case, regions of the brain that light up when you get a reward jittered with dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memory changed you. But by pulling this memory to mind, neuroscientist Steve Ramirez says, you also changed the memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some elements of the memory heightened in importance. Others receded. Your brain snipped out and inserted details without your conscious knowledge. The mood you were in at the time of reminiscence left emotional fingerprints on the memory, as neurons activated by your mental environment synced up with those activated by the recollection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time you revisit this heartwarming scene you change it a little bit, both as a subjective experience and a physical network of cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans have engaged in this two-way operation of memory revision for as long as we’ve been conscious.

As it was going through the review process, Liu died suddenly at the age of 37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grief, Ramirez writes, is not so different from memory: “Both endure across the entire lifespan, forever changing us, helping us to decide what matters most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;hr class="divider"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez, now 37, opened his own lab at Boston University in 2017. In the years since, memory researchers have made impressive strides:&lt;a class="link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36577400/" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;u&gt;restoring memories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lost&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa5542" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;u&gt;to amnesia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, activating a memory while&lt;a class="link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4169316/" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;u&gt;suppressing the emotions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; attached to it,&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(15)00711-4.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;u&gt;detaching the emotional reaction&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to one memory and&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0389-0" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;u&gt;attaching it to another&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The tools now exist to erase whole events and corresponding emotions from mouse brains, or to artificially jump-start memories and all the feelings that go with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is no expectation in the research community that laser-wielding doctors will one day artificially reshape human patients’ memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, these experiments are possible only with mice that have been genetically modified to have brain cells that light up when exposed to lasers. Genetically altering a human in this manner, researchers interviewed for this story said, is neither ethical nor practical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t need to generate technophobic fears of a digital future where our memories will be distorted — our memories can already be distorted very effectively by nondigital means,” memory scientists Ciara Greene and Gillian Murphy wrote in “Memory Lane: The Perfectly Imperfect Ways We Remember,” &lt;a class="link" href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691257099/memory-lane?srsltid=AfmBOopgQ1Ds304dqO-W0DN2aHn-VtF3qetQAzYfm9Bz1vWnitX5Kr50" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;published earlier this year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans are suggestible creatures with extremely pliable memories. Armed with little more than a few leading questions, researchers have found that most&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.apa.org/news/podcasts/speaking-of-psychology/memory-manipulated" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;u&gt;humans can be easily manipulated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into believing that they did or saw something they didn’t. We don’t need lasers to activate our memories, which can be summoned at will or triggered by any number of sensory cues, or to edit their contents, which our brains do constantly without any conscious input from us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real goal of research like his, Ramirez said, is to establish the biological mechanisms of memory and apply that knowledge to noninvasive therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If researchers understand exactly how to retrieve a memory from a mouse hippocampus that brain damage has rendered inaccessible, for example, that information could be the basis for a drug that helps preserve or strengthen certain types of memory in people suffering from dementia or other cognitive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how an animal brain encodes memories and the emotional responses they evoke could lead to better cognitive therapies for post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious dark side of this line of research is that someone who understands how to boost well-being through memory manipulation could just as easily use the same knowledge for pernicious ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea of artificially changing our own memories might elicit uneasy feelings of a dystopic future where relationships are erased, identities are replaced, and governmental powers implant thoughts in our heads to mind-control society,” Ramirez writes in his book. But, he said, any tool in existence can be used to harm or help, and he’d rather make well-intended progress than none at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea of memory manipulation, to me, makes sense if we have an ethically bounded goal, and that ethically bounded goal is to restore health and nourish human well being,” he said. “Exercise is an antidote for the brain, and social enrichment is an antidote [and] a good night’s sleep is an antidote. What if toggling with memories in a therapeutic manner can also be an antidote? Then we’re in business.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNMXQ4a2VCcW5iSDFsdlpyR2JHbHJXYlh1dklLWk1qM0hxb1pQNXhCeXdpLWdhdWlVWjRYVFd4QnRSOExsMXFiS1dlejNEVnlHRkdVS0k2QTZ3b0xhQmxHSDR2dzdlUU00WGR4RE54TDV6T0dWTmQ3VjZxTHhrT1BxMGFiSnVhdTlMVlJOV19hUFlOMlFaSTYtakhqM21pVnJYSFFIbXF2SXZ0bHZNdkluOVpSU0prNkRzOVE</guid></item><item><title>医生认为卵巢，而不仅仅是卵子，是生育和衰老的因素-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/27/health/eggs-ovaries-fertility-aging.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 10:01:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPVnl2RjRDNTEtUXp5N29SRjJfRlE0cXIyZkhoUEIxMnQ3dXNZbFNuTEIxdnN2Wk9KdzIteFlLVC15RU42VWJJRHhmYXduQ3p1RmlIdnk0MmkyQmRmMUVGeFBmQWFFZWdxZy1KQ3h5V3lDT2Y3cU5rcENpR1RiRHFZUQ</guid></item><item><title>产后抑郁症：爸爸们谈论“残废”病情- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8v8xe24gzo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;'The nightmares were horrific' - dads open up about crippling post-natal depression&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gtLOOD"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5261/live/12b6efd0-d5ae-11f0-aaf9-cfb9de77e0db.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5261/live/12b6efd0-d5ae-11f0-aaf9-cfb9de77e0db.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5261/live/12b6efd0-d5ae-11f0-aaf9-cfb9de77e0db.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5261/live/12b6efd0-d5ae-11f0-aaf9-cfb9de77e0db.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5261/live/12b6efd0-d5ae-11f0-aaf9-cfb9de77e0db.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5261/live/12b6efd0-d5ae-11f0-aaf9-cfb9de77e0db.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5261/live/12b6efd0-d5ae-11f0-aaf9-cfb9de77e0db.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5261/live/12b6efd0-d5ae-11f0-aaf9-cfb9de77e0db.png.webp" loading="eager" alt="How's Dad?

I thought by acting that way, eventually that would come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But it didn't, and in October 2021, when Bea was just six weeks old, Aled left the house one morning with the intention of ending his life and "eliminating the problem".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I started to overthink this and really focus on, I am the problem.

Dawson&lt;/a&gt; of Florida Polytechnic University (&lt;a href="https://floridapoly.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FPU&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results point to new ways to probe small, regular structures hidden inside complex biological materials. They also hint at future light sources that work safely with living tissue for sensing and imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A biolaser is a laser that uses biological material as part of the device. It still needs a gain material, a feedback structure, and enough pump energy to cross the &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.50.1675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lasing threshold&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here the gain came from the dye, and the feedback appears to arise from tiny structures inside the feather. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors ruled out the usual mirror based cavities and found that something within the feather acts as a resonator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-peacock-colors-are-special"&gt;Why peacock colors are special&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eyespot colors do not come from paint like pigments alone. In peacocks, a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC240659/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;photonic&lt;/a&gt; crystal of melanin rods embedded in keratin inside each barbule sets the hue by reflecting specific wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those nanostructures are common across birds, and their evolution is well &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/71179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt;. Across species, thinning melanin layers expands the palette of iridescent colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That structural heritage explains the feather’s strong color, but the new laser action needed an added dye and repeated wetting and drying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cycling likely helps the dye and solvent diffuse into the barbules and slightly loosen protein fibrils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-lasers-from-peacock-feathers"&gt;Building lasers from peacock feathers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers trimmed decorative peacock &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chicken-embryos-reveal-secrets-of-early-feather-development/"&gt;feathers&lt;/a&gt; and mounted the eyespot region on an absorptive base. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They soaked the surface with rhodamine 6G in a water and ethanol mix, dried it, and repeated this step several times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the final cycle, they pumped the still wet sample with 532 nanometer pulses and captured the emitted spectrum. The procedure produced sharp lines only after multiple wet and dry cycles, not after a single stain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-experiments-showed"&gt;What the experiments showed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two tight peaks emerged in the yellow orange region, centered at 574 and 583 nanometers. The team saw the same wavelengths from different colored areas of the eyespot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The dye infused barbules were prepared by repeatedly wetting the eyespot with dye solution and allowing it to dry,” Dawson explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While wet, and after wet and dry cycling, across multiple parts of the same feather as well as across different &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/vulture-fossil-reveals-that-volcanic-rock-can-preserve-feathers/"&gt;feather&lt;/a&gt; samples, a highly conserved set of laser wavelengths was observed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thresholds measured for the 583 nanometer line were about 380 microjoules per square millimeter in the brown region and about 290 microjoules per square millimeter in the yellow region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The green region delivered the strongest emission relative to the broad fluorescence background. That behavior tracks the dye’s absorption and emission bands and the local structure of the feather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-different-from-random-lasers"&gt;Different from random lasers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many biological samples, lasing can occur without a well defined cavity. A random laser uses many scattering paths in a disordered medium for feedback, and its spectrum is very sensitive to small changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Random lasing in dyed human tissues has been demonstrated with diagnostic implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The system is found to emit laser light that cannot be random laser emission,” wrote Dawson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The peacock feather behaves differently. The same two wavelengths repeat across different feather regions and across samples, which is not typical of random systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7843591/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; has shown lasers from bird feathers in other ways. Parrot feathers produced random lasing when feathers and dye were sandwiched between plastic films. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new peacock result maps consistent laser modes inside the natural structure after dye infusion and cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-peacock-feather-laser-cavity"&gt;Peacock feather laser cavity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors did not find evidence that the color setting photonic lattice itself provides the feedback. Whispering gallery modes need round structures of a specific size, which do not appear in the barbules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They point instead to small, repeated features that form many low quality resonators with similar optical lengths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those hidden building blocks could be protein granules, dye nano crystals, or other mesoscale elements created or revealed by the stain cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/penny-sized-ultrafast-laser-could-help-self-driving-cars-see-better-measure-gravitational-waves/"&gt;laser emission&lt;/a&gt; as a probe can reveal subtle order in complex tissue. Stable spectral lines that repeat across a sample suggest recurring microstructures that are hard to spot by imaging alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of optical fingerprinting could help characterize biocompatible materials, and one day inform sensors or imaging tools that work with minimal power in living systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further work will need to identify the exact structures and understand how processing steps tune them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-04039-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 02:57:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPV3drSGswMkpiR21lTm5MRWRFb19RaEdBSm5XcFRsVExLQVlVS3hiNm9hYy1NZTlha2l4MEdhVkVZNmd2cl9rbDlVbEpEWDcyRFA5LURzZ0Fib25UZDdwQlIxazNaWHJNV3I1dEJCSEc5c1R6RUdzTnZ4djFRaDJlOTdNYlZGMmc0bGRseTJPRQ</guid></item><item><title>周六放缓：印度有800-900万痴呆症患者，这5种大脑锻炼很重要-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/dementia-5-brain-workouts-that-can-reduce-the-risk/photostory/126198489.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, reading is good for your brain, but only if you’re actually engaging with it. Passive reading (scrolling through headlines) doesn’t do much. Active reading, where you think, imagine, and question, is where the magic happens. It improves memory, language skills, and attention span—all areas affected early in dementia. Writing is just as powerful. Journaling, storytelling, or even writing long WhatsApp messages instead of voice notes helps your brain organise thoughts and recall memories. Word games like Scrabble, crosswords, or an occasional Sudoku also help—just don’t rely on only one type.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 01:54:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>像Adderall这样的多动症药物不像医生和科学家以前认为的那样起作用- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/adhd-stimulant-medications-like-adderall-do-not-work-like-doctors-scientists-believed/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stimulant medication like Ritalin and Adderall are often given to children with ADHD. In the United States, about 3.5 million children between 3 and 17 years old take these medicines, and the number keeps growing as more children are diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people think the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/adhd-medication-lowers-risks-of-suicide-accidents-and-crime/"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; help children pay attention better, but new research shows that this is not exactly how they work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large study from Washington University School of Medicine (&lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WashU Medicine&lt;/a&gt;) found that these medicines do not directly change the parts of the brain that control attention. Instead, the drugs make the brain feel more awake and make tasks feel more interesting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a child feels more alert and finds a task more rewarding, it becomes easier to stay with that task, even though their basic ability to focus has not changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stimulant-medications-don-t-help-focus"&gt;Stimulant medications don’t help focus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many years, clinicians and researchers believed stimulants helped children focus by strengthening brain regions responsible for attention control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Benjamin Kay, an assistant professor of neurology at WashU Medicine, noted that this view shaped his own medical training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I prescribe a lot of stimulants as a child neurologist, and I’ve always been taught that they facilitate attention systems to give people more voluntary control over what they pay attention to,” said Dr. Kay. “But we’ve shown that’s not the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of seeing changes in attention networks, the research team observed the strongest effects in areas related to arousal and reward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These regions influence how awake the brain feels and how worthwhile an activity appears, both of which strongly affect behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-adhd-medications-change-the-brain"&gt;ADHD medications change the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how stimulants change brain activity, the researchers analyzed resting state functional MRI data from 5,795 children aged eight to eleven who participated in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study (&lt;a href="https://abcdstudy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ABCD Study&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resting state scans measure brain activity when no specific task is being performed, allowing researchers to examine underlying brain organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-plastics-chemical-bpa-linked-to-autism-adhd-in-children/"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt; who took stimulants on the day of scanning showed increased activity in brain regions linked to wakefulness and reward. In contrast, regions classically associated with attention did not show significant changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern appeared consistently across the large dataset. Dr. Kay explained why this matters for how improvement is interpreted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather, the improvement we observe in attention is a secondary effect of a child being more alert and finding a task more rewarding, which naturally helps them pay more attention to it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-same-effect-in-adults"&gt;Same effect in adults&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team validated these results in a controlled experiment involving five healthy adults who did not have ADHD and did not regularly take stimulant medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant underwent resting state brain scans before and after taking a dose of methylphenidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, the medication altered arousal and reward related brain networks rather than attention circuitry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This confirmation helped rule out explanations tied only to childhood development or ADHD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-motivation-drives-improvement"&gt;Motivation drives improvement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Essentially, we found that stimulants pre-reward our brains and allow us to keep working at things that wouldn’t normally hold our interest – like our least favorite class in school, for example,” said study senior author Dr. Nico U. Dosenbach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increase in perceived reward helps explain why stimulant medications often improve persistence and reduce hyperactivity. Tasks that once felt unrewarding no longer trigger the urge to disengage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results also provide a potential explanation for how stimulants treat &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dog-adhd-impacts-learning-but-small-changes-can-help/"&gt;hyperactivity&lt;/a&gt;, which previously seemed paradoxical,” noted Dr. Dosenbach. “Whatever kids can’t focus on – those tasks that make them fidgety – are tasks that they find unrewarding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sleep-affects-adhd-stimulant-benefits"&gt;Sleep affects ADHD stimulant benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep emerged as a critical factor in the study. Many children in the dataset did not get the recommended nine or more hours of sleep each night. Short sleep duration was linked to poorer school grades and altered brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with ADHD who took stimulant medication performed better academically than peers with ADHD who did not take stimulants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children who slept too little but took stimulants also showed better grades than sleep-deprived children who did not take medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We saw that if a participant didn’t sleep enough, but they took a stimulant, the brain signature of insufficient sleep was erased, as were the associated behavioral and cognitive decrements,” said Dr. Dosenbach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reevaluating-adhd-medications"&gt;Reevaluating ADHD medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts emphasized that stimulants cannot replace healthy sleep. “Not getting enough sleep is always bad for you, and it’s especially bad for kids,” said Dr. Kay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that sleep deprivation can mimic ADHD symptoms, including difficulty paying attention and declining school performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, stimulant medication may appear to help by mimicking the effects of adequate sleep while leaving the long term consequences of sleep loss unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest a shift in how stimulant medications should be understood. Rather than directly improving attention, these drugs increase alertness and make tasks feel more &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/autism-and-adhd-disorders-directly-linked-amount-of-time-kids-spend-on-screens/"&gt;rewarding&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That combination can improve persistence and performance, especially in children with ADHD or those who do not get enough sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By separating attention from arousal and motivation, this research offers a clearer explanation for how stimulant medications shape behavior and brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01373-X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 01:49:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxPLTNaWlpWM2F5UkNqam9MeGhhalZwcnJ6Y05QUEs3YzhJT3hQN3JPa3NRUHM2ZEZVMlNDem9rUlg2d0ZZYUV2WHlVMWVJaUpSNThNQlIyNHdnVzFwd09tVGx5RVJ4enQ3dHFtNmJyX2FmYU5ZZjZjSHRKeDJPZnpJLTdvaVF3dHhfZDQzSE9DT2lBcGNTRlctRWZNMEpWMF96amVfeUxJWVRpNXJhTGgxamVoYw</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，在减肥的同时锻炼可以保持肌肉“年轻” - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/working-out-while-losing-weight-keeps-muscles-young-study-finds</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;When we lose weight, we don't just lose body fat – we lose muscle, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be a problem for many reasons, because skeletal muscle is far more than the tissue that helps us move. It plays a crucial role in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/2046-2395-3-9"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;, regulating &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00033.2024"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/54.5.B207"&gt;healthy ageing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing muscle mass is linked to reduced mobility, increased injury risk, and is thought to potentially impair long-term weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/do-fasted-workouts-really-burn-more-fat-heres-what-science-says"&gt;Do Fasted Workouts Really Burn More Fat? Here's What Science Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With millions of people now using weight loss drugs such as Wegovy and Ozempic, understanding what impact this muscle loss &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.6586"&gt;might have on their health&lt;/a&gt; is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss of muscle mass is also a significant challenge for athletes, as many sports encourage them to keep body weight low while still maintaining demanding training loads and keeping their power-output high. So an energy deficit can put significant stress on an athlete's body – but to what extent it affects their normal function &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40279-024-02108-y"&gt;is unclear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite these widespread implications, we still know surprisingly little about how human muscle responds at the molecular level to the combination of calorie restriction and exercise. Understanding what happens to muscle when exercising in a calorie deficit is extremely important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186718" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186718" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/medicine_ball_exercising_642.jpg" alt="man exercising with a medicine ball" class="wp-image-186718 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/medicine_ball_exercising_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/medicine_ball_exercising_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186718" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Knowing how muscles behave when calories are restricted is important for people losing weight and for athletes.

We showed that weight loss accompanied by aerobic exercise might not be that bad for the muscles after all – and indeed it may have positive effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recruited ten healthy, fit young men who completed two tightly controlled five-day experimental trials in our laboratory. During their first trial period, they consumed enough calories to maintain their body weight. But during the second, we reduced their daily calorie intake by 78 percent – a severe energy deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During both trials, participants completed a tightly-controlled, 90-minute low- to moderate-intensity cycling exercise three times during each five-day period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the trials, we measured blood markers such as glucose, ketones, fatty acids, and key hormones linked to energy preservation. We did this to determine if – and to what extent – the energy deficit was affecting them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also collected muscle biopsies before and after each testing period. Using an advanced method called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-9802-9_9"&gt;dynamic proteomic profiling&lt;/a&gt;, we analysed the production and abundance of hundreds of muscle proteins. This allowed us to build a detailed picture of how muscle adapts to sudden, substantial calorie restriction – even when exercise demands are maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the five days in an energy deficit, participants lost about 3 kg. Hormones such as leptin, T3, and IGF-1 also dropped sharply – clear signs the body was getting into an energy preservation mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But inside the muscle itself, something more unexpected was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Muscle tissue changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The muscle tissue mounted a strong and surprisingly positive response to the combination of exercise and calorie restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we saw an increase in the amount of mitochondrial proteins within the muscle, and these proteins were also being created more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are the power generators inside cells. They convert fat and carbohydrates into usable energy. Higher amounts of mitochondrial proteins and faster production of them are hallmarks of a healthier and more efficient muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186717" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186717" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/shoulder_muscle_illo_642.jpg" alt="shoulder muscle illustration" class="wp-image-186717 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/shoulder_muscle_illo_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/shoulder_muscle_illo_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186717" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The positive changes we saw within the muscle tissue correlated with a more youthful muscle profile. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGjWbg0p78/"&gt;Jitendra Jadhav/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also saw a clear decrease in the amount and production of collagen and collagen-related proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collagen is an abundant protein that plays a role in providing structure and strength to the muscle. However, collagen tends to accumulate in excess as we age – contributing to stiffness and impaired function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these changes resemble a shift toward a more metabolically youthful muscle profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of response has also been seen in long-term calorie-restriction &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2019.12.002"&gt;studies in monkeys&lt;/a&gt;. But this is the first time it has been demonstrated in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Healthier ageing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it seems paradoxical that the body would invest energy in maintaining or improving muscle during a time of scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle tissue is demanding and costly to maintain – and movement is energetically expensive, too. Shouldn't the body simply reduce muscle activity to save energy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question may lie in our evolutionary past. Humans evolved as hunter-gatherers, who often faced periods of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30573-1"&gt;low food availability&lt;/a&gt;. During those times, the ability to move efficiently – to walk and run long distances, forage or hunt – was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-024-01876-x"&gt;essential for survival&lt;/a&gt;. A body that shut down muscle function during hunger would have been less likely to survive and reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the protective response we observed may reflect deep evolutionary adaptations: muscles stay ready to move even when fuel is running low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study involved a small number of young men who were deliberately following an extreme energy deficit for a short period of time. As such, we cannot assume identical responses in women, older adults or people who are obese or have chronic health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will need to compare weight loss with and without exercise, examine less extreme calorie deficits, include women and older adults, and measure how these molecular changes translate into actual physical performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, our findings support the idea that exercise during weight loss may protect muscle quality – and may even enhance characteristics linked to healthier ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings also have key implications for many people. People who are taking weight loss drugs or trying to lose weight may benefit from structured exercise to help them preserve muscle quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults, who are more vulnerable to muscle loss, may especially benefit from exercising while losing weight. Athletes may approach any energy deficit with care, but know that muscle keeps adapting to exercise stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study shows that human muscle is remarkably resilient. Even under severe stress, when much of the body is trying to conserve energy, muscle tissue seems to respond robustly – boosting its energy-producing machinery and limiting age-related degradation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, losing weight and exercising doesn't just help preserve muscle – it may help keep it younger.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268812/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s simpler than you might think. “The No. 1 dinner habit to support metabolism is eating a balanced meal that contains protein, fiber and healthy fats, rather than skipping dinner or eating it extremely late,” says &lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Eat-Your-Vitamins/Mascha-Davis/9781507211359" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mascha Davis, M.S., RD.&lt;/a&gt; This approach isn’t about restriction or complicated rules; it’s about providing your body with the essential nutrients it needs to function optimally, even while you rest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But first, people talk a lot about healthy metabolism, but what does that actually mean? In a nutshell, “Metabolism is a set of chemical reactions that break down the food we eat and turn it into energy—think of it like your body’s very efficient, very behind-the-scenes power plant,” says &lt;a href="https://janelevnutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jane Leverich, M.S., RDN.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A balanced dinner ensures this power plant has high-quality fuel to run efficiently through the night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-regulates-key-hormones-and-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Regulates Key Hormones and Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your body doesn’t just shut down when you go to sleep. It performs crucial maintenance and recovery tasks, and your dinner helps provide the energy for this work. “Dinner plays a critical role in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-ways-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check-11791785" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;regulating blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/longform/7915557/hormones-spotlight/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;appetite hormones&lt;/a&gt; (like leptin and ghrelin) and even overnight muscle repair,” says Davis. By eating a well-rounded meal, you give your body the tools it needs to keep these systems in check.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A meal that combines protein, fiber and healthy fats digests slowly, leading to a gradual release of glucose into the bloodstream. This prevents the sharp spikes and subsequent crashes in blood sugar that can disrupt sleep and throw your hormones out of whack. “A well-balanced evening meal helps &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291843/these-are-the-fastest-ways-to-stabilize-your-blood-sugar-if-you-have-diabetes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stabilize glucose levels&lt;/a&gt; through the night, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7934351/things-you-should-never-do-after-5-p-m-if-you-re-trying-to-lose-weight/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduces late-night cravings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-to-break-for-better-metabolic-health-8751700" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;supports metabolic efficiency&lt;/a&gt; while you sleep,” says Davis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This stability is key to preventing late-night snacking, and helps you wake up feeling balanced and ready for the day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-it-preserves-muscle"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; It Preserves Muscle &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most significant factors influencing your metabolic rate is your lean muscle mass. Muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than fat tissue does, so maintaining it is crucial for healthy metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is where the protein component of your dinner becomes especially important.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; During sleep, your body undergoes processes of muscle protein synthesis, where it repairs and builds muscle tissue. Providing it with a sufficient source of amino acids from protein at dinner supports this vital function. “Protein at dinner is especially important for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-proteins-when-taking-weight-loss-medications-8767913" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;preserving lean muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;, a key driver of metabolism,” says Davis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Prioritizing a quality protein source like lean meat, fish, beans or tofu can directly contribute to maintaining the very tissue that keeps your metabolic engine running strong.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-prevents-negative-side-effects-of-meal-skipping"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Prevents Negative Side Effects of Meal-Skipping &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In an attempt to cut calories, some people may believe that skipping dinner is a smart move. However, this strategy can often have the opposite effect on your metabolism. When your body is deprived of fuel for an extended period, it can trigger &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-does-stress-affect-the-body-8661817" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;physiological stress responses&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-know-high-cortisol-levels-11762693" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;increased cortisol production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This can lead to negative consequences like disrupted sleep, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-spike-your-blood-sugar-11762553" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;blood sugar imbalances&lt;/a&gt; and increased hunger the next day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As Davis explains, “Skipping dinner or relying on a low-nutrient, ultra-light meal can backfire and lead to blood sugar dips, disrupted sleep and increased hunger the next day, all of which can negatively impact metabolic function.” This can create a vicious cycle: you wake up ravenous, potentially overeat at breakfast and experience more intense cravings throughout the day. Consistently eating a balanced dinner helps break this cycle and promotes a more stable, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2056824/16-weight-loss-tips-and-tricks-that-actually-work-according-to-dietitians/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;efficient metabolism&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not sure where to start in building a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/12228/30-days-of-healthy-whole-food-dinners/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy, balanced meal&lt;/a&gt; that supports your metabolism? We’ve got you covered with a few tried-and-true recipes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-ways-to-support-your-metabolism"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Ways to Support Your Metabolism &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond building a balanced dinner plate, there are other habits you can adopt to give your metabolism a helping hand. Here are some straightforward strategies you can start incorporating right away.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated:&lt;/strong&gt; Water is vital for nearly every process in your body, including the chemical reactions that drive your metabolism. Maintaining good hydration throughout the day helps your internal “power plant” work efficiently and keeps your metabolic processes running smoothly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize movement:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical activity increases your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7937672/how-to-calculate-your-metabolism/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;resting metabolic rate&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you include exercises that build muscle, like strength training. Even small actions, like taking the stairs or enjoying a brisk walk after dinner, can add up and support your metabolism over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Quality sleep helps balance the hormones that regulate appetite and metabolism, like leptin and ghrelin. Aim for seven to nine hours each night, and remember that a balanced dinner can help you rest easy by preventing nighttime hunger and blood sugar dips.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The message is clear: Dinner is not a meal to skip. Instead of viewing dinner as a dietary obstacle, reframe it as a key opportunity to nourish your body and support your metabolism. By adopting this habit of combining protein, fiber and “good” fats on your plate, you provide your body with the steady energy it needs for overnight repair, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7805452/hormone-balancing-foods-how-diet-can-help/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;hormone regulation&lt;/a&gt; and muscle maintenance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This single, consistent habit can help you avoid the metabolic pitfalls of meal skipping, such as blood sugar instability and intense next-day cravings. It sets you up for better energy levels, more stable moods and a more efficient metabolism in the long run. The best part is that this approach is all about balance. It’s not a fad diet but a simple, effective principle of nutrition that supports your overall health and well-being, one delicious dinner at a time.

&lt;p&gt;A new study has sparked hope in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease by demonstrating that the disease can be reversed, at least in mice. For years, Alzheimer’s has been viewed as a relentless and irreversible condition, but recent findings from researchers challenge this belief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Restoring NAD+ Balance Could Change Alzheimer’s Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease has long been considered irreversible, with most research efforts focused on slowing its progression rather than reversing its effects. However, a team of scientists from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and the &lt;strong&gt;Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center&lt;/strong&gt;, led by &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Andrew A. Pieper&lt;/strong&gt;, has discovered that the key to fighting Alzheimer’s could lie in the brain’s energy balance. Central to this balance is NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), a molecule critical for cellular energy and function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As people age, NAD+ levels naturally decline, which impairs cellular function, especially in the brain. In the case of Alzheimer’s, this decline is even more pronounced. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reversing Alzheimer’s: A Feasible Strategy or Hopeful Fantasy?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/alzheimers-breakthrough-study-identifies-new-culprits-that-could-revolutionize-treatment/" data-type="post" data-id="70733"&gt;Alzheimer’s &lt;/a&gt;was believed to be an irreversible condition once it reached a certain point. The prevailing view in the scientific community held that once cognitive decline began, recovery was impossible. This new study, however, has upended that assumption. Using animal models with both amyloid and tau-related mutations, which mirror human &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s pathology&lt;/strong&gt;, the researchers showed that by restoring NAD+ balance, they could repair extensive brain damage and fully restore cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were very excited and encouraged by our results,” said&lt;strong&gt; Dr. Pieper&lt;/strong&gt;, the senior author of the study. “Restoring the brain’s energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer’s. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the idea that restoring the brain’s NAD+ balance might help patients recover from Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discovery offers a new perspective, suggesting that Alzheimer’s therapy may not only be about slowing the disease’s progress but also potentially recovering lost brain function. If this strategy proves successful in humans, it could lead to a paradigm shift in Alzheimer’s treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Mechanism Behind Alzheimer’s Reversal: NAD+ and Brain Health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.uhhospitals.org/news-releases/articles/2025/12/study-shows-alzheimers-disease-can-be-reversed-in-animal-models" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, revolve around a critical molecule in the body: &lt;strong&gt;NAD+.&lt;/strong&gt; This molecule plays an essential role in maintaining cellular function, particularly in the brain. NAD+ is involved in cellular metabolism, DNA repair, and overall cellular health. As we age, &lt;strong&gt;NAD+ levels &lt;/strong&gt;decline, and this process accelerates in those with Alzheimer’s. The researchers found that the inability of the brain to maintain proper NAD+ levels is a major factor driving Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors used a pharmacological compound, &lt;strong&gt;P7C3-A20, to restore NAD+ balance&lt;/strong&gt; in the brains of &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s mice&lt;/strong&gt;. This compound did not just slow the disease’s progression; it reversed existing damage and restored cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beyond Alzheimer’s: What This Could Mean for Other Neurodegenerative Diseases&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications of this discovery extend far beyond &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;. Other age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s and Huntington’s, also involve a decline in brain function and cellular energy balance. The findings from this study suggest that restoring &lt;strong&gt;NAD+ balance&lt;/strong&gt; could have a broader application for treating chronic, age-related neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Pieper&lt;/strong&gt; emphasized the need for further research to explore this approach in other conditions. “This new therapeutic approach to recovery needs to be moved into carefully designed human clinical trials to determine whether the efficacy seen in animal models translates to human patients,” he explained. “Additional next steps for the laboratory research include pinpointing which aspects of brain energy balance are most important for recovery, identifying and evaluating complementary approaches to Alzheimer’s reversal, and investigating whether this recovery approach is also effective in other forms of chronic, age-related neurodegenerative disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Breakthrough for Alzheimer’s: Clinical Trials Are the Next Step&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The promising results from this research have sparked a renewed sense of optimism in the fight against Alzheimer’s. However,&lt;strong&gt; Dr. Pieper and his colleagues&lt;/strong&gt; caution that while these results are promising, they must be confirmed in human clinical trials before any potential treatments can be widely recommended. The team is actively working toward moving their findings from animal models to human trials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hope is that this research will lead to new therapies that not only slow Alzheimer’s progression but also offer a genuine chance of recovery. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is important when considering patient care, and clinicians should consider the possibility that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring brain energy balance might offer a path to disease recovery,” said Dr. Pieper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As this research progresses, it opens new avenues for Alzheimer’s treatment, offering fresh hope to patients and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

(WIS) - Prisma Health announced it will temporarily restrict children’s visits to hospitalized patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Prisma Health said this is due to increased rates of community influenza and other respiratory illnesses. Prisma Health will restrict anyone 15 and younger from visiting hospitalized patients as of Tuesday, Dec. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“By taking this proactive step, we can help ensure our hospitals remain safe places for our patients to receive high-quality care,” said Jacie Volkman, executive director of Prisma Health’s Department of Infection Prevention. Exceptions may be allowed for circumstances such as the imminent death of a loved one, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Visitors who feel sick should not visit their hospitalized loved ones. Prisma Health recommends that all visitors wear masks to help avoid the spread of respiratory illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there have been at least 1,900 deaths from the flu so far this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated against the flu.

        &lt;figure id="attachment_227293" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-227293" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-227293 size-full" src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Helen-Delgard-and-wife-Stephanie-with-their-baby-credit-family-photo-supplied-through-SWNS.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-227293" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Helen Delgard and husband Stephane with baby Noah – family photo, via SWNS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple who started IVF last Christmas Day has given birth to a baby boy after 11 years of trying to conceive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helen Delgard was warned she may never be able to conceive naturally with her husband Stephane, but following a January surprise, they’re getting to celebrate Christmas with little Noah, who’s now 14 weeks old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The couple started trying for a baby soon after they got together in 2014, but Delgard already had a complex medical history. She had undergone abdominal surgery to remove much of her bowel and been told she might never conceive naturally as a result&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was very unwell when Stephane and I first met, so he was aware of my issues and we thought we’d just see where life took us,” Delgard told Britain’s Southwest News Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few years of trying, Delgard underwent a surgery to try and remove some of the scar tissue from previous surgeries which was believed to be potentially blocking her fallopian tubes. They were referred to Bristol fertility clinic for help after the surgery failed to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After starting treatment on Christmas day, Delgard found out she was pregnant in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However, despite all the care that had got us to that point, I became quite ill and experienced heavy bleeding at the end of the third week of pregnancy which led us and the medical team to anticipate that I might have lost the baby,” she told SWNS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE STORIES LIKE THIS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My six-week scan was therefore carried out with the greatest delicacy, mindful of our potential loss, and the radiologist very sensitively positioned the screen so the image was not in our line of vision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AGAINST THE ODDS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But then, with a huge smile, she turned it back and showed us Noah’s tiny heartbeat. We both broke down, and the team were crying too. After that it was a relatively uncomplicated pregnancy and our beautiful boy was born at 37 weeks, weighing 6lbs. 10oz.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The support from the clinic throughout our journey was incredible… We thank the whole team and wish them a very merry Christmas.”&lt;/p&gt;
