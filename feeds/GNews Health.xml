During emergency surgery to repair the injury doctors&lt;span&gt; discovered a defect in part of her vaginal wall that allowed the intestines to break through and leave her body. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it was not specified what caused the woman's injury, authors of the case &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S102845592400305X?via%3Dihub"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S102845592400305X?via%3Dihub"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S102845592400305X?via%3Dihub"&gt;report &lt;/a&gt;cite a chronic cough or intense coughing fit as risk factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once the organs were repositioned, the surgeons fixed the defect, the woman recovered and she returned home five days later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Both women experienced small bowel evisceration through their vaginas, with one suffering from it after an intense coughing fit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was formally diagnosed with vaginal cuff dehiscence - the reopening of a surgical site - with small bowel evisceration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a known possible complication of a hysterectomy, but is still very rare, occurring in about 0.032 percent of patients following a pelvic operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is limited data on the occurrence of wound dehiscence, but a 2014 &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bmcsurg.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2482-14-65"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found up to three-in-100 people who have had abdominal and pelvic surgeries may experience it. That rises to up to 10 percent of elderly patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it can be deadly for four-in-10 patients due to excessive blood loss, prolonged severe pain or injury to the organs that have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the 2011 case report, the woman went to the emergency department and told doctors she had an intense coughing fit and then felt her bowel protruding from her vagina - six inches of her intestines were outside of her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the prior three years, the woman had been experiencing a vaginal vault prolapse - when the top of the vagina falls into the vaginal canal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition had been well-managed, however, by her primary doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually her situation became too complicated and she was referred to a specialist but the evisceration occurred before she was able to make an appointment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors rushed the woman into surgery where they repaired the defect and replaced her bowels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The operation was successful and she was discharged six days later.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officially, the woman's diagnosis was ruptured vaginal vault leading to prolapse of the small bowel.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Authors of the case &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/881945/s/B"&gt;report &lt;/a&gt;wrote the prolapse of small bowel through a ruptured vagina has been reported in just 113 cases worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mortality rate in vaginal evisceration is about six percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When these injuries occur, they must be treated with surgery to replace the organs and close any open wounds or defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A sterile saline covering should also be put on eviscerations to keep the exposed organs moist until surgery can be performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 11:40:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOcmt1dHRoS0xqc2hXRTdnSVZ2MzFybDFNZTFJbjhaSHJtVy1BS05OYTFLTTQ4YXRxbTk3RUVJTVBWcEpvQjN3ejB6QzI5TDlqdWhRckdYQWp2bDkxTU9rUGJHSXR6ZzRmZnpDRlE4OGpCSW1zb0Y1XzcwY051d0l3czF0S3hlbVY3UE9hZnpRWWNORUZCR1ZZaFFIXzYxNDQyTkR5WNIBqgFBVV95cUxNdjA2RlBZcTZqWFRKT3RDQktLLXp0UkE5NWlEaDE3VEE5ZVplMnBHYmJNVDViM3BUVlgwSEhIa0RMQkQzUDQ1dHdDMXlIQ2R1dk1ybnBBUHkwYlJRQ1hRWlgwcUFDNV90S2hEajJnTnVFU3M0YWdrOGtMbkluY3BvTGdHSVBzeHRKZW9GTkRaZmdtaXY4b3k4UTRBTTdfcGdiSEFMcmREU2lFdw</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，以色列人在战争中面临严重的睡眠危机- Ynetnews | Israelis face serious sleep crisis amid war, new study shows - Ynetnews</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE14ZG1UY1p2cTJ5MVoxdnNocGNkNk1UaDFUU1ktS1pkd25ROUNlS0JMWTlrdG1DX3pRWW91MXpSZGpPQ29pTnBjVzVhbXBSYWN1Tk9LcjFMckNwX3VpWGo5ZzVEeXhZRG5MVENz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-contents="true"&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="fd11p-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="fd11p-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="fd11p-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Nightly sirens, rocket fire and persistent anxiety – the severe &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a id="ryAL9ZtF114le" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/bjttx00ilkl" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="fd11p-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;decline in sleep quality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="fd11p-2-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;

But regarding sleep – that's precisely where the problem starts. The body can't 'fade out' when highly aroused. Falling asleep becomes very difficult."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="3dttv-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3dttv-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3dttv-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dr. Uri Alkan, head and neck surgeon and sleep specialist at Rabin Medical Center, concurred: "We have a survival mechanism responding to threat by releasing hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. As the body prepares for danger, heart rate and blood pressure rise, pupils dilate – we enter high arousal, like an animal reacting to a lion's roar, ready to flee or fight."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="48vqi-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="48vqi-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="48vqi-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The problem, Alkan said, is that sleep requires the exact opposite state: "During sleep, the body downshifts – heart rate and blood pressure drop, muscles relax. When under attack – even briefly – the body remains alert long after. This profoundly disrupts sleep."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="d8r1t-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="d8r1t-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="d8r1t-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Sirens aren't the only disruption. Both body and mind remain in sustained vigilance, hindering relaxation even in quiet. "There's a bidirectional link between sleep and anxiety," Alkan added. "Poor sleep increases anxiety risk because emotional balance largely occurs during sleep. Conversely, anxiety causes hyperarousal damaging sleep quality, making it less deep and increasing wakefulness from minor noises. An anxious person wakes easily."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="67jkg-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta wrapped"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleWrappedImageComponenta"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleWrappedImageData.ryeLCTEgVgl" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/06/17/HkL0XrrRXee/HkL0XrrRXee_169_0_496_661_0_medium.jpg" alt='ד"ר אורי אלקן' title="Dr. Uri Alkan (Photo: Shir Chasin) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="caption" contenteditable="false"&gt;Dr. Uri Alkan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span disabled class="credit" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Shir Chasin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="401jf-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="401jf-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="401jf-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Anxiety also affects internal sleep structure ("sleep architecture"): less deep sleep and less REM sleep. During prolonged stress, people wake easily and struggle to fall back asleep. "If someone wakes briefly for the bathroom and returns to sleep, the body remains parasympathetic (calm). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="d5mc6-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="d5mc6-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="d5mc6-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“But if they turn on the TV, read news, hear explosions or go to a shelter during wakefulness, their entire sympathetic system activates. Once aroused, returning to sleep is much harder," Alkan explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="v1or-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="v1or-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="v1or-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Saporta noted daytime distractions contribute to the sleep problems. "Often, we avoid difficult thoughts during the day: busy with kids, work, social media. But at night, when quiet and the body should relax, everything we suppressed surfaces. We're flooded with worries and fears about the situation. When exhausted with no resources left to suppress, falling asleep becomes incredibly hard," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="dl3p9-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="dl3p9-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dl3p9-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Chronic sleep deprivation poses serious health risks. "Sleep is an existential need, not a luxury," emphasized Alkan. "Like breathing, drinking or eating – you cannot live without sleep. If this basic need is impaired, quality of life suffers, followed by health and longevity."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="bctdq-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="5c1of-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5c1of-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5c1of-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Immediate effects include fatigue, irritability, depression, anxiety, impaired memory and slowed reaction times. Long-term risks rise for hypertension, high blood lipids/sugar, heart attack, stroke and traffic accidents. "This isn't just discomfort – it's a real health problem requiring attention," Alkan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="1pp27-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="1pp27-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1pp27-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Despite feeling impossible, steps can improve sleep:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="alit9-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="alit9-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="alit9-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;1.  Optimize environment: Make the sleep space (even a shelter) pleasant, quiet and comfortable. Use mattresses, pillows, ensure comfortable temperature, avoid bright lights suppressing melatonin. Warm, dim yellow light signals sleep time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="d0hkk-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="d0hkk-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="d0hkk-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;2.  Reduce screen time: Significantly cut screen exposure, especially pre-sleep. Avoid TV or phone scrolling at night. If waking, avoid screen light; stay in relative darkness to allow the body to relax back to sleep. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="k2n8-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="k2n8-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="k2n8-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;3.  Maintain routine: Keep consistent sleep times even during upheaval. Limit daytime naps if struggling at night. "Our bodies love routine," Alkan noted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="3q5c7-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3q5c7-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3q5c7-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;4.  If awake: Don't stay frustrated in bed. Get up, read calmly, listen to a podcast or practice guided imagery (e.g., visualizing a favorite nature path). Return to bed when sleepy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="2ggg0-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="dgk2h-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="dgk2h-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dgk2h-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;5.  Practice breathing: "Correct breathing – longer exhalation than inhalation, calm and deep – signals the body no immediate danger exists, activating the calming system. Breathing shifts focus from worries to the present body," advised Saporta. Techniques include "smelling a flower" (inhale), "blowing out a candle" (exhale), ensuring exhalation is longer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="fp8rs-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="fp8rs-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="fp8rs-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;6.  Use guided imagery and calming techniques: Visualize a safe place or use the "Butterfly Hug" technique (cross hands on opposite shoulders, tap rhythmically while deep breathing). "These have immense power, helping the body shift from arousal to calm – essential for sleep," Saporta said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="arng7-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="arng7-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="arng7-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;7.  Help children: Explain the situation simply, without denial or excessive fright. Teach child-friendly breathing techniques ("Mountain to Valley": finger rises up mountain/inhale, descends valley/exhale). "Children need adults to be a regulating voice, providing calm and security – critical for their sleep and overall safety," Saporta emphasized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8s4b7" data-offset-key="780qu-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="780qu-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="780qu-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;When insomnia becomes chronic, seek help. "Start with your family physician," Alkan recommended. "If that's insufficient or the situation is complex, consult a sleep specialist. If the main cause is psychological (anxiety or trauma), consult mental health professionals. There are solutions and people to turn to. This is part of coping and recovery.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 10:44:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE14ZG1UY1p2cTJ5MVoxdnNocGNkNk1UaDFUU1ktS1pkd25ROUNlS0JMWTlrdG1DX3pRWW91MXpSZGpPQ29pTnBjVzVhbXBSYWN1Tk9LcjFMckNwX3VpWGo5ZzVEeXhZRG5MVENz</guid></item><item><title>40岁的爸爸在警告其他人不要忽视容易错过的症状后死于癌症-镜报 | Dad, 40, dies from cancer after warning others not to ignore easily missed symptom - The Mirror</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTFBGejZ3RmM1aC0taWI1NFU3akpiREVPYjVWcU5FVEJ3c1Z1TklYSWd5X01nbHViVGVMOU5JTWx1Uzh4Tk8xT3FrXzFIWTFodTFwVVhWMzVraGd2Wk9BekE2NkNvbTNyUFVsTDF0d29aSTF3TTBvNURFTEN30gF_QVVfeXFMTWhyWGVBb21pZnFIUjdXUlo2NVV4aDh1eWw1aHlEbFRMSkZ3OTYzbVIzSHlfYWNvbUUtT2x3VmdzdHVkOExxVnRORzAwV0xWQ2pxS1Bkd0hzZm1DTWhzY0hyWTJkdkpSS1NzRFh0MG5XVkFOOW5obHU3aHBoVEY2dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-body" class="ArticleBody_article__AwrJE" data-testid="body"&gt;&lt;h1 class="HeadingOne_heading-one__mmNWJ  __className_09f1df"&gt;Dad, 40, dies from cancer after warning others not to ignore easily missed symptom&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 class="LeadText_lead-text__wd_PA __className_d2008b" data-testid="leadtext"&gt;A 40-year-old father, who has four children, 'didn't present any of the conventional symptoms' before receiving his devastating cancer diagnosis.

However, your &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/relationships/family/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;family&lt;/a&gt;, friends, and coworkers might not always understand just how serious your condition is. They might need some (not so) gentle reminders from time to time. In a very honest post on the AITA online group, internet user u/DiabeticBridesmaid opened up about how her sister, a bride-to-be, tried to pressure her to take off her medical equipment for the wedding. Why? To look better in the photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was something that the diabetic bridesmaid was completely against, and it &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111our6/aita_for_refusing_to_remove_my_medical_equipment/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;sparked&lt;/a&gt; a bit of a family drama. Scroll down to read the full story, which had a surprisingly positive twist. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bored Panda&lt;/strong&gt; has reached out to the author, and we’ll update the article once we hear back from her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Diabetes is nothing to joke about.

explains that insulin pumps, which are small wearable medical devices, essentially &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/insulin-pumps" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;mimic&lt;/a&gt; how a person’s pancreas naturally releases insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pumps provide a continuous flow of rapid-acting insulin underneath the person’s skin. “Insulin pumps are an alternative to multiple daily injection (MDI) insulin therapy (syringe or pen injections) for people with diabetes who require insulin to manage the condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="diabetic-medical-devices-sisters-wedding-5-1"

Especially when it comes to your health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the author of the post, u/DiabeticBridesmaid, she has Type 1 diabetes and wears two medical devices. One is a blood sugar monitor, and the other is an insulin pump. In short, they automatically monitor and regulate her blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This basically means I don’t have to prick my fingers to test blood sugar or give myself insulin injections, the system does that automatically and makes my life way easier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the devices are small, the woman’s sister tried to pressure her into taking them off for her wedding, so that the photos would come out better. The author’s mom later pressured her, too. However, nobody should take off essential medical equipment without first consulting their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="diabetic-medical-devices-sisters-wedding-4" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/diabetic-medical-devices-sisters-wedding/?image_id=diabetic-medical-devices-sisters-wedding-4.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Woman Refuses To Put Her Health At Risk For Sister’s Wedding Photo Aesthetic, Upsets Family" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/diabetic-medical-devices-sisters-wedding/?media_id=diabetic-medical-devices-sisters-wedding-4" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/diabetic-medical-devices-sisters-wedding-4.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8883966" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/diabetic-medical-devices-sisters-wedding-4.jpg" alt="Close-up of woman touching her face, expressing concern about refusing to risk health for sister’s wedding photo aesthetic." title="Close-up of woman touching her face, expressing concern about refusing to risk health for sister’s wedding photo aesthetic." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-with-hands-on-her-face-staring-intensely-mXmb-MgFfIg" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Fellipe Ditadi/Unsplash (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, u/DiabeticBridesmaid had other family members in her corner. Her brother and granddad backed her up. Since the latter was paying for the entire wedding in the first place, he had a lot of sway. “Grandpa apparently drove an hour into town this afternoon just to tell my mother how disappointed he was and that he must have gone wrong somewhere raising her. He told her that if they didn’t apologize and make things right, my mom should figure out how to pay for all of the outstanding wedding costs herself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led to a refreshingly positive twist. The woman’s sister and mom actually apologized to her. Instead, they decided to look for ways to dress the medical equipment up, using a corsage or shawl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this day and age, it’s also possible for wedding photographers to do some very subtle and graceful photo-editing, too, to hide these devices. Though you could also easily argue that having this equipment is nothing to be ashamed of. They reflect the reality that the bridesmaid is diabetic. It might be healthier for everyone to embrace this reality than to try to cover it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts about the way the entire wedding drama turned out? Has anyone ever asked you to change something crucial about yourself for a &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/not-letting-my-nephew-bring-dog-to-wedding/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;big event&lt;/a&gt;?

chosen for its high viewership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before and after viewing, they completed a test that measures focus and attention control by requiring them to name the ink color of a word, even when the word spells out a different color, along with three psychological questionnaires. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists observed that after watching pornography, participants had significantly slower reaction times and made more errors on the test compared to their performance before viewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the brain activity patterns seen in these students resembled those found in individuals with drug addiction and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A recent study found that regularly viewing pornography can immediately reduce a person's performance on tasks requiring attention and cognitive control right after exposure to explicit content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Approximately 69 percent of men and 40 percent of women in the U.S. view online pornography each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among young adults aged 18 to 25, 57 percent report using porn monthly or more often, compared to 29 percent of those aged 25 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Porn addiction is more prevalent among men, with 11 percent reporting having the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was conducted by scientists from Chengdu Medical College in China, who recruited 16 healthy college students and five college students with severe internet pornography addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants completed the test, watched the 10-minute pornography video, and then did the test again, while scientists monitored their brain activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each group completed 18 rounds of the test, with each round lasting two seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results revealed clear differences between the two groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Low-frequency users demonstrated stronger connectivity in brain regions involved in language processing, movement coordination and sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Low-frequency users demonstrated stronger connectivity in brain regions involved in language processing, movement coordination and sensory input. While the high-frequency users showed increased connectivity in areas associated with executive functions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the high-frequency users showed increased connectivity in areas associated with executive functions, which are commonly linked to addiction and emotional regulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This suggests that frequent pornography consumption may produce neural and behavioral effects similar to other types of addiction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the team noted that the low-frequency group also showed slower accuracy and increased reaction while taking the test.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those findings suggest that even if people viewing porn sporadically, they will still experience cognitive effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also examined emotional responses during viewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants who watched pornography less frequently displayed a wider range of emotions, such as surprise, fear, and disgust, while frequent viewers showed more muted or neutral facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This supports the idea that repeated exposure to explicit content may dull emotional sensitivity over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to cognitive effects, the high-frequency group scored significantly higher on anxiety and depression questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the study does not establish whether pornography use causes these symptoms or if they arise from other factors, the results align with earlier research connecting heavy pornography consumption to increased emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The effects of internet pornography addiction on brain functional connectivity in the prefrontal lobe exhibit characteristics similar to those of drug addiction,' the researchers concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Moreover, individuals who frequently consume internet pornography report that they experience stronger sexual arousal and heightened pleasure while viewing, which subsequently adversely affects their cognition and emotions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate study, released in May 2024,  evaluated thousands of adults across the world for 'problematic pornography use,'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That was defined as watching enough pornography as hurting relationships and job performance, and found that three percent of people exhibited concerning usage, but less than one percent sought treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Beatha Bőthe, lead study author and psychologist at the University of Montreal, said: 'Our research shows that the problematic pornography use may be more common than many might think and affects a wide range of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It highlights that while many are struggling, not many seek help. That's important because it suggests that more work needs to be done to understand and support those who are affected by it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 06:24:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOQU1qcXd3OEJ1QjNqQjhkN2lOX0JmWERCTjRGTHZFWVpmLWlJdnFGVzZXNVFpbXZvYV8yX1ItMUxxZHBWdmtpeEpnd28xNUtvOUtKQ3Z0R2NfbFVDb0p1SWtLU2tFb0o0TnFVb25kMGV1OFNCa3BiNERJVGhsWnVWMUZSOWVlSVlYQzNERVRIanZjSEJISTE4d0dnUWVPeW9uSHoyNDc2ZnluNTZYNnfSAbMBQVVfeXFMUG5LdEMxODNxcXMzejExbm1FdjJRYXNPdmtRbjJTSF9FVVdyOUJMUV9HOWpXNmJpWmotLVZLak5xdkk0TlZUX055WnlMREV5SUUyQnhxLXFiTXk2U1NPTHpvcHNiNFMyWVkwUmhmUXIzM0dqVWIyaHpCN0FZU0lBNHhNM1ZuS2JWR3RSUXFKcXZDVHNOY3FnbWpQMzNNOVZPRlVYeTMtV25sWGVqVS1SSkZpSWc</guid></item><item><title>如果胆固醇高，可以吃黄油吗？心脏病专家解决争论- EatingWell | Is It Okay to Eat Butter If You Have High Cholesterol?

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;While you might think otherwise, butter can fit into a heart-healthy diet if eaten in moderation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research shows that dietary cholesterol has minimal impact on cholesterol levels, but saturated fat does affect cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pair butter with fiber, herbs and healthy fats to enjoy it in a balanced way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the last decade, butter consumption in the United States has surpassed that of margarine for the first time since the 1950s.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; From trends like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7797774/what-is-bulletproof-coffee-and-is-it-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bulletproof coffee&lt;/a&gt; to concerns about trans fats in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17512/which-is-healthier-butter-or-margarine/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;margarine&lt;/a&gt;, Americans have plenty of reasons to go back to butter. But you might wonder if butter is good for you, especially if you have high cholesterol. While it might shock you, the short answer is yes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With more than 25 million adults in the United States having high cholesterol, the question of how butter affects cholesterol may be a pretty common one.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We talked to a cardiologist to understand how butter can be part of a healthy-cholesterol diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; First, let's cover the basics. "It's important to distinguish between cholesterol levels in the bloodstream and dietary cholesterol in foods, like that found in butter or eggs," says &lt;a href="https://nutrition.tufts.edu/academics/faculty/dariush-mozaffarian#new_tab" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dariush Mozaffarian, M.D., Dr.P.H.&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at Tufts Medical Center. Cholesterol levels in the blood help predict your risk of heart disease. Healthy total cholesterol levels should be under 200 mg/dL, whereas high cholesterol is defined as a total cholesterol level of 240 mg/dL or higher.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And anything in the range between these two numbers means that you are at risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are two types of blood cholesterol: low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also known as "bad" cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), known as "good" cholesterol. When LDL is high, it builds up plaque in the walls of your arteries, which can increase the risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On the other hand, HDL cholesterol plays a key role in supporting your heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-butter-can-be-part-of-a-healthy-cholesterol-diet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Butter Can Be Part of a Healthy-Cholesterol Diet  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Foods like butter, eggs and shellfish contain cholesterol. However, research has shown that the cholesterol you get from food has little effect on blood cholesterol. So it's not considered a nutrient of concern by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While dietary cholesterol doesn't raise blood cholesterol levels, excessive intake of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15803/is-saturated-fat-truly-bad-for-your-heart/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;—which butter contains—has been shown to increase LDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, that doesn't mean butter is out of the question.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "One can think of butter as something to eat in moderation while focusing on eating more unsaturated fats from fruits, nuts and seeds," says Mozaffarian. "Unsaturated fats have very positive effects on blood cholesterol levels and reduce the risk for heart disease."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults limit their intake of saturated fat to less than 10% of their total daily calories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, the American Heart Association has stricter guidelines to lower cholesterol levels, limiting saturated fat to less than 6% of total daily calories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To put it into perspective, that's less than 13 grams of saturated fat per day for a 2,000-calorie diet. And one tablespoon of butter has over 7 grams of saturated fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The most important thing for someone with high cholesterol is to get the big things right," says Mozaffarian. "Eat a healthy diet rich in minimally processed fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains, fish, plant oils and yogurt. Limit soda, energy drinks, candy, refined grains and processed meats. Avoid tobacco, alcohol and other drugs, get plenty of exercise, sleep well, find ways to reduce mental stress and find meaning in life." All of these will help keep your cholesterol levels in check.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-tips-to-enjoy-butter-if-you-have-high-cholesterol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Tips to Enjoy Butter If You Have High Cholesterol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Now that you know you can eat butter in moderation if you have high cholesterol levels, here are some tips on how to enjoy it:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair it with high-fiber foods: &lt;/strong&gt;Research has shown that fiber helps lower cholesterol by reducing the amount absorbed into the bloodstream. Plus, who doesn't love roasted veggies with a little bit of butter?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance it with unsaturated fats: &lt;/strong&gt;Mixing butter and heart-healthy oils, such as olive oil or avocado oil, reduces the amount of saturated fat while delivering plenty of flavor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix it with herbs: &lt;/strong&gt;Creating your own butter blends—mixing butter with roasted garlic, herbs or spices—helps intensify the flavor, meaning you need less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Butter isn't off-limits if you have high cholesterol. However, moderation is key. While research has shown that dietary cholesterol from foods like butter doesn't impact your cholesterol levels, saturated fat—also found in butter—does. So it's important to enjoy butter mindfully. Pairing it with fiber-rich foods, using small amounts and mixing it with herbs will help keep your numbers in check.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The bigger picture? Heart-healthy habits matter more than any one food alone. Try incorporating regular movement, less stress and good sleep into your life—and savor that pat of butter without guilt.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EatingWell</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 05:29:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5fMVVhSmQ4MVZyamQ4RHl0ZERIVWVLTXIwRFVFZUpxVEZ4ajhkckVvQWVtX0tsWTNsbWhsbmlIX0dvYWFHOVA0eElid1JBUWpOaWJBUC0tbEY5c1NwcDA0Wms0WW1leTd4Q1J3eTlGQkc</guid></item><item><title>这不仅仅是“慢性疲劳” ： ME/CFS不仅仅是疲劳-对话 | It’s not just ‘chronic fatigue’: ME/CFS is much more than being tired - The Conversation</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPcTFGb2F0VTBZQnduMTZyQ1BieU0tcFBuUlFMd0U3aUFXd0NLQ2lleVlNSFY2clhfRDFHMkp3RG1zek1ac0lLRUN6MHFkS1N6Z3AtMjZCQ2xvVFpaS1dVNXJQb1k1TkV4UXVYM0VWTWViUVVVU1RXUjJ6azJXY3h5dW9jX2t5bXdieFAxbWxzeEItRG5qeHVFdlFwVi1TUEJZUEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is as complex as its name is difficult to pronounce. It’s sometimes referred to as simply “chronic fatigue”, but this is just one of its symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, ME/CFS is a complex &lt;a href="https://icd.who.int/browse/2025-01/mms/en#569175314"&gt;neurological disease&lt;/a&gt;, recognised by the World Health Organization, that affects nearly every system in the body. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name refers to muscle pain (myalgia), inflammation of the brain (encephalomyelitis), and a profound, disabling fatigue that rest can’t relieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the illness’s complexity – and its disproportionate impact on women – means ME/CFS has often been incorrectly labelled as a &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/57/1/7"&gt;psychological disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is ME/CFS?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ME/CFS affects people of all ages but is most commonly diagnosed in middle age. It is two to three times &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13929-9"&gt;more common in women&lt;/a&gt; than men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the exact cause is unknown, ME/CFS is commonly triggered by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9152619/#R17"&gt;an infection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The condition has two core symptoms: a disabling, long-lasting fatigue that rest doesn’t relieve, and a worsening of symptoms after physical or mental exertion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is known as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;post-exertional malaise&lt;/a&gt;. It &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2011.02428.x"&gt;means&lt;/a&gt; even slight exertion can make symptoms much worse, and take much longer than expected to recover. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This varies between people, but could mean simply having a shower or attending a social event triggers worse symptoms, either immediately or days later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These symptoms include pain, sleep issues, cognitive difficulties (such as thinking, memory and decision-making), flu-like symptoms, dizziness, gastrointestinal problems, heart rate fluctuations and many more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2011.02428.x"&gt;For some people&lt;/a&gt;, symptoms can be managed in a way that allows them to work. For others, the disease is so severe it can leave them housebound or bedridden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can fluctuate, changing over time and in intensity, making ME/CFS a particularly unpredictable and misunderstood condition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not just ‘in your head’&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing body of scientific evidence, however, clearly shows ME/CFS is a biological, not mental, illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02506-6"&gt;Neuroimaging studies&lt;/a&gt; have revealed differences in the brain activity and structure of people with ME/CFS, including poor blood flow and lower levels of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers in the nervous system).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other research indicates the condition affects how the body produces energy (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2302738120"&gt;the metabolism&lt;/a&gt;), fights infection (the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmed.2024.02.003"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;), delivers oxygen to muscles and tissues, and regulates blood pressure and heart rate (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmed.2024.02.003"&gt;the vascular system&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Issues with criteria&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To diagnose ME/CFS, a clinician will also exclude other possible causes of fatigue, which can be a lengthy process. A patient needs to meet a set of clinical criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one of the major challenges in researching ME/CFS is that the diagnostic criteria clinicians use vary worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some criteria &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/014107689108400224"&gt;focus solely on fatigue&lt;/a&gt; and include people with alternate reasons for fatigue, such as a psychiatric disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others are more narrow and may only capture ME/CFS patients with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5650200/pdf/nihms875353.pdf"&gt;more severe symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, it can be very difficult &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21641846.2017.1353578"&gt;to compare&lt;/a&gt; across different studies, as the reasons they include or exclude participants vary so much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Changes to the guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Australia, doctors often receive &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10721550/"&gt;little formal education&lt;/a&gt; about ME/CFS.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most commonly, they follow the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners’ clinical guidelines to &lt;a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2002/177/1/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-clinical-practice-guidelines"&gt;diagnose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.racgp.org.au/clinical-resources/clinical-guidelines/handi/handi-interventions/exercise/incremental-physical-activity-for-cfs-me"&gt;manage&lt;/a&gt; ME/CFS. These are based on the &lt;a href="https://www.meresearch.org.uk/research/canadian-criteria/"&gt;Canadian Consensus Criteria&lt;/a&gt; which are considered more stringent than other ME/CFS diagnostic criteria. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They include post-exertional malaise and fatigue for more than six months as core symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.racgp.org.au/clinical-resources/clinical-guidelines/handi/handi-interventions/exercise/incremental-physical-activity-for-cfs-me"&gt;these guidelines&lt;/a&gt; are outdated and rely heavily on &lt;a href="https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2377-7-6"&gt;controversial studies&lt;/a&gt; that assumed the primary cause of ME/CFS was “deconditioning” – a loss of physical strength due to a fear or avoidance of exercise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These guidelines recommend ME/CFS &lt;a href="https://www.racgp.org.au/clinical-resources/clinical-guidelines/handi/handi-interventions/exercise/incremental-physical-activity-for-cfs-me"&gt;should be treated&lt;/a&gt; with cognitive behavioural therapy – a common psychotherapy which focuses on changing unhealthy thoughts and behaviours – and graded exercise therapy, which gradually introduces more demanding physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While cognitive behaviour therapy &lt;a href="https://www.emerge.org.au/gradedexercisetherapyandmecfs/"&gt;can be effective&lt;/a&gt; for some people managing ME/CFS, it’s important not to frame this condition primarily as a psychological issue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graded exercise therapy can encourage people to push beyond their “energy envelope”, which means they do more than their body can manage. This can trigger post-exertional malaise and a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1300/J092v11n01_02"&gt;worsening of symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2024, the &lt;a href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/health-advice/me-cfs"&gt;Australian government announced&lt;/a&gt; A$1.1 million towards developing new clinical guidelines for diagnosing and managing ME/CFS.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading organisations have scrapped the recommendation of graded exercise therapy in the United States (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/management/index.html"&gt;in 2015&lt;/a&gt;) and the United Kingdom (&lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng206"&gt;in 2021&lt;/a&gt;). Hopefully Australia will follow suit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What can people with ME/CFS do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we wait for updated clinical guidelines, “pacing” – or working within your energy envelope – has shown some success in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-04587-5"&gt;managing symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. This means monitoring and limiting how much energy you expend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some evidence also suggests people who rest in the early stages of their initial illness often experience &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264331"&gt;better long-term outcomes&lt;/a&gt; with ME/CFS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially relevant after the COVID pandemic and with the emergence of long COVID. Studies indicate more than half of those affected meet &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmed.2024.02.003"&gt;stringent clinical criteria for ME/CFS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In times of acute illness we should resist the temptation to push through. Choosing to rest may be a crucial step in preventing a condition that is much more debilitating than the original infection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

But here's a twist: those "healthy" or "everyday" oils might be slowly damaging your liver and kidneys—especially if they’re overheated, reheated, or used way too often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Seed oils: Inflammation rockets hiding in plain sight&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From busy kitchens to your everyday dining table, seed oils like soybean, corn, sunflower, and cottonseed are everywhere. They earned a healthy halo early on since they’re plant-based and lower in saturated fat. But &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apm.amegroups.org/article/view/54474/html?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;is now giving them a darker side. These oils are heavy in omega-6 fatty acids, which in excess trigger inflammation and oxidative stress in the liver—fuel for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's not all. When these oils are overheated or reused—say, in deep-fried snacks or reheated vegetable dishes—they become unstable. They break down and form toxic compounds: aldehydes, lipid peroxides, even polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These oils damage liver cells and stress their DNA repair systems, contributing to inflammation, fibrosis, and potentially liver disease .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe that reheating cooking oil can be harmful to your health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reheated oils—A toxic rollercoaster&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all hate food waste, so the temptation to reuse oil is strong. But research on repeatedly heated oils is straight-up alarming. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33210326/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in 2021 showed that consuming oil reheated three or more times led to visible damage not just in the liver, but also in the kidneys, pancreas, and gut tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice had elevated liver enzymes, oxidative stress markers, and even DNA damage .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another classic study on cooking fumes found that women exposed to heavy kitchen oil fumes—like those you'd get from working in a fast-food environment—had more than double the risk of developing fatty liver disease compared to those in well-ventilated conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Signs that all is not well with your liver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not all oils are created equal: Better options&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, not all oils are culprits here. Science now walks us through a hierarchy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extra‑virgin olive oil: Loaded with monounsaturated fats and antioxidants, this oil lowers liver-fat markers, supports insulin response, and fights oxidative damage. Epidemiological studies link it to better liver and overall mortality outcomes—take that as a green light for salad dressings and low-heat sautéing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocado oil: Similar profile to olive oil—healthy fats, high smoke point, good for the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold‑pressed sesame oil: Packed with antioxidants, it supports liver enzymes and reduces inflammation—and even helps kidney health in high-fat diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flaxseed and walnut oils: High in omega-3s—they reduce liver fat and inflammation, though best used raw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canola oil (cold‑pressed): Neutral profile and low saturated fat; swapping butter or palm oil for it has been linked to lower mortality .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even virgin coconut oil has its niche—its medium-chain triglycerides may help metabolism when used sparingly. But high consumption can still contribute to fatty liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What you can do: Kitchen wisdom for liver love&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, ditch the heated seed oils for everyday use. That means no more bulk cooking with soybean, sunflower, or corn oil. Swap in olive or avocado oil for cooking, and use flaxseed or walnut oil raw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, resist the urge to reuse oil. One batch, maybe two max—if at all. When it’s foggy or smells off, it’s time to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, mind your cooking temperature. Stay below smoke points; steady medium heat is safest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth, watch packaged foods. If a processed curry or snack lists "vegetable oil" without clarity, it’s likely a heated seed oil bomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, invest in cold-pressed and minimally processed oils—even if they cost a bit more, your liver and kidneys will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Swipe that cooking oil smartly&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your kitchen oils aren’t mere flavor boosters—they’re gatekeepers of organ health. Heated or refined seed oils bring inflammation, free radicals, and liver-kidney stress. Reusing oil compounds that danger exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flip the narrative: use olive, avocado, or sesame oil. Watch temperature. Avoid reheating. Those simple steps protect vital organs—and spare you from silent diseases like NAFLD, kidney strain, or worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil in your pan might be quietly influencing your body’s biggest filters. Treat it like the health decision it is. And next time you cook, remember: it’s not just taste—it’s longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 03:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwJBVV95cUxQcVhpeGdiNC1uU1BlYnpjbXlVTmZmQjJwS01pQzlEeFRaM3ZyMFhmM1JIZzgzSkRxMV9yTy1YelZSZ1hUXzlDQlFJM1lkNlBWaWVZcUEwUkVxLXUxZnBUcUFpVE1FSjhCZTBpSFBtbzZwbk8tM19nWlNFWk1ZYThhYWowUGhHZnlTRG80RTJZb3E4dTBQWUhTNWhnTkRWOER2TmdUQlp1YUJHZ2ZZVVQxSEQ4b2dOZFl0Uk1LOXdvcm9lSmh5cmhwSkloc0txaXVSQjR6TkYzU1FnZk44TV9ULXlxdnp2Wms0QnlIdXhiLXp3UV9hcDdEVGRUUGNHNkVHZ1hVYmRTT05jSFlsWGRpU09zYU1EVkgxN3VV</guid></item><item><title>一项研究揭示了早期痴呆症的最大风险因素，知识就是力量- BuzzFeed | A Study Has Revealed The Biggest Risk Factors For Getting Early Dementia, And Knowledge Is Power - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE9ZYWtEMnlSQ0s1bnRDYzNqSGZiaElPa2NSV0FrcG9jZ1JMYmx3eHRtN21XQmJKTWR2WlUtWk5acXo5dzdrZkNic0pPd2ZpZ2M1d1VNV1hMbDRUTUc3QXNMc21jWDVDaC1fdzVFN1piNC1kcGJhdU1YMmhzamtyS00?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study results are consistent with what medical experts have been advising patients for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/arman-fesharaki/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888404" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Arman Fesharaki-Zadeh&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of psychiatry and of neurology at the Yale School of Medicine, recommended three “lifestyle measures” that folks may want to consider when trying to lower their risk of young-onset dementia ― starting with physical exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An active daily exercise practice can have far-reaching benefits, which include enhanced neurocognitive function,” Fesharaki-Zadeh said, adding that physical activity can boost neurogenesis (the formation of new neurons and synapses), vasculogenesis (the creation of new blood vessels) while also providing inherent mood benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, focus on eating nourishing foods. Fesharaki-Zadeh championed a Mediterranean-based diet, mentioning its well-documented benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Such dietary practice, which includes food groups such as green leafy vegetables, olive oil, salmon and blueberries, is rich in vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, as well as antioxidants ― all neuroprotective factors,” he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fesharaki-Zadeh recommended cognitive, mood and social stimulation to keep your mind sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For cognitive stimulation, this could look like learning a new language or attending a seminar, listening to music or dancing. Basically, anything that engages your mind will help it stay healthy. Mood stimulation, on the other hand, relates to stress reduction practices, “such as mindfulness and yoga,” Fesharaki-Zadeh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for social stimulation, it’s pretty simple: Try to connect with other humans face-to-face and actually talk to them as much as possible. “In the era of pandemic and now post-pandemic, quality social connections should increasingly be encouraged and practiced,” Fesharaki-Zadeh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these habits don’t cover the whole list of dementia risk factors, they are a pretty solid start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/study-early-dementia-risk-factors_l_6596cf44e4b0f27b6e3691c8" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888404"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cycling was linked to a 19% lower dementia risk and 22% lower Alzheimer's risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Active travel may boost gray matter in memory-related brain regions, like the hippocampus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Benefits of active travel persist regardless of genetics, especially for Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dementia is a condition that disrupts memory, cognitive abilities and the ability to perform daily tasks, and its prevalence continues to rise globally, particularly among older adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The good news? Staying physically active in middle age may be a powerful way to lower the risk of developing dementia. Research consistently highlights the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/add-six-hours-longevity-study-8754775" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protective benefits of regular movement&lt;/a&gt;, though many adults still fall short of meeting recommended activity levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One effective method to boost physical activity is what is referred to as “active travel,” which includes walking or cycling for transportation. In other words, the simple act of skipping the car, bus or train and traveling by foot or bike may have a profound impact on brain health. Active travel not only promotes general health but has also been linked to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/strength-training-diabetes-study-11713071" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;decreased risk of conditions like diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and potentially dementia.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But participating in active travel won’t be a magic bullet to living a dementia-free life. The interplay between lifestyle habits and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;genetic predisposition of developing dementia&lt;/a&gt; adds another layer of complexity. While active travel presents health advantages for most individuals, the extent of those benefits may differ depending on a person’s genetic risk for dementia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To explore this relationship further, researchers in the UK conducted a study to determine how various modes of travel influence dementia risk, including Alzheimer’s disease, alongside changes in brain structure, and their results were published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To conduct this study, researchers used data from the UK Biobank cohort. These participants came from different regions across England, Scotland and Wales. The study gathered extensive information about their demographics, lifestyles, health conditions and more through surveys and exams. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this research, some participants were excluded, such as those already diagnosed with dementia at the start or shortly after (within 2 years), those who couldn’t walk, and those missing travel-related data. The study looked at two groups of dementia cases: those who developed dementia before age 65 (&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/early-onset-dementia-study-11723661" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;younger onset dementia&lt;/a&gt;) and those diagnosed at 65 or older (later onset dementia). The researchers ultimately evaluated 479,723 participants with over 13 years of follow-up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To gather information about travel habits, participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire that included questions about transportation choices that they used. Based on their answers, the researchers grouped travel modes into four categories: nonactive (using cars, motor vehicles, or public transport), walking, mixed-walking (a mix of walking and nonactive modes) and cycling and mixed-cycling (cycling combined with other modes).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To identify individuals with dementia, they relied on detailed health records using standardized codes for medical diagnoses. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They also used information from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain, heart and abdomen. The research also looked at genetic factors related to dementia, focusing on the APOE gene, which is known to play a key role in dementia risk. Specifically, two genetic markers (called single-nucleotide polymorphisms) were used to determine whether a participant had a higher genetic risk. Participants were then grouped based on whether or not they carried the APOE ε4 gene variant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over a follow-up period of about 13 years, researchers found that out of all participants, 1.8% were diagnosed with dementia, including a very small group who developed it at a younger age (0.2%). The study compared different types of travel, like walking, cycling, or a mix of the two, with nonactive travel modes like driving. The results showed that people who cycled, or combined cycling with other modes, had a notably lower risk of developing dementia overall, particularly later-life dementia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For instance, using a mix of walking reduced overall dementia risk by 6%, while cycling or combining cycling with other methods lowered the risk by 19%. Even for younger onset dementia specifically, cycling or mixed-cycling appeared to cut the risk by 40%. On the other hand, walking alone seemed to slightly increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease by 14%, but cycling or mixed-cycling helped reduce its risk by 22%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When researchers studied brain scans , they found that cycling and combining cycling with other methods of travel were linked to slight increases in gray matter volume (GMV) in certain parts of the brain, including the hippocampus, which is important for memory. Walking and combining walking with other travel modes, however, were linked to slightly smaller volumes of gray and white matter in some areas. Importantly, these changes don’t suggest a higher risk of dementia but highlight how different activities may affect the brain. Nonactive travel, like driving, didn’t show any significant impact on brain structure in this study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Interestingly, the researchers found that genetic risk didn't change the link between travel mode and early-onset dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. However, for all dementia types and late-onset dementia, genetics did play a role. People who didn’t have a specific genetic marker (APOE ε4) seemed to benefit more from cycling, showing lower dementia risks compared to those with the marker. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While these results are interesting and compelling, it is worth noting some limitations to this study. First, because younger onset dementia is relatively rare, the researchers couldn’t break down the different types of cycling, making it hard to draw a firm conclusion. To improve this, future studies need more participants with younger onset dementia and longer follow-up periods. Second, they relied on people reporting their own travel habits, which might not always be accurate. Third, the researchers didn’t track how travel habits changed over time, making it challenging to best understand these patterns. Finally, the study group lacked racial and ethnic diversity, as most participants were of European ancestry, so the results may not apply to all groups equally.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Understanding how active travel impacts dementia risk can ignite meaningful changes in your daily life, especially if you are focused on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-foods-that-can-improve-cognitive-health-11754643" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting your cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine replacing those quick car rides with a refreshing walk or bike ride! Not only do you help the environment by cutting down on emissions when you do this, but you also take a proactive step toward protecting your brain health. Whether it’s walking to the corner store, cycling to work or enjoying a peaceful stroll in the park, these simple shifts can deliver long-term benefits. The great thing is that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026823/what-is-joyful-movement/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;incorporating more movement&lt;/a&gt; into your routine is achievable for most people and it may also support your brain health to boot.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not all communities make it easy to bike or walk to work or while running errands. But if you can find time to go for a ride around the neighborhood or lengthen your parking lot walks at the grocery store, those little moments of extra activity could be helpful to your longterm health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But active travel is just one piece of the bigger picture. Brain health thrives on a combination of regular exercise, a balanced diet, staying socially connected and getting quality sleep. While we can’t control genetic factors, adopting healthy habits like active travel empowers us to take charge of what we can. The key is to tailor these efforts to your environment—whether that’s walking more in pedestrian-friendly cities or cycling in bike-supportive areas. Small, consistent actions add up, and over time, they may help support not only your cognitive health but your overall health as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt; suggests that cycling may be linked to a 19% lower risk of developing dementia and a 22% lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers found that cycling may increase gray matter volume in the hippocampus, which plays a critical role in memory. Conversely, nonactive modes of travel like driving did not show meaningful effects on brain health. While genetic factors can influence these outcomes, the study suggests that physical activity through active travel offers protective benefits regardless of genetic predispositions, especially for those without high-risk genetic markers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether through cycling, walking or other forms of active travel, making intentional choices about how we move through the world can yield profound health benefits. While active travel is not a one-size-fits-all solution, it can be a practical and rewarding way to support both brain and body. By combining movement with other healthy lifestyle choices, like eating a nutrient-rich diet, getting quality sleep and staying socially connected, you can take meaningful steps toward a healthier future.&lt;br&gt;

                The study asked about signs of addiction to mobile phones, social media and video games. Those signs can include being preoccupied thinking about them and being unable to cut down on using them.

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you know is in crisis, contact the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://988lifeline.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;988 Suicide &amp;amp; Crisis Lifeline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; via call, text or chat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="hr"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A new study finds that addiction to social media, mobile phones and video games is linked to a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2835481" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The study, published in JAMA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, looked at data on more than 4,000 kids from an ongoing longitudinal study following them for years, starting at ages 9 to 10. It found that by age 14, about a third of the kids had become increasingly addicted to social media, about a quarter had become increasingly addicted to their mobile phone and more than 40% showed signs of addiction to video games.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"And these youth are significantly more likely to report suicidal behaviors and thoughts," says study author &lt;a href="https://vivo.weill.cornell.edu/display/cwid-yux4008" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yunyu Xiao&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"It's an important study and raising awareness about screen addiction," says &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/jason.nagata" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Jason Nagata&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician specializing in adolescent screen use at the University of California, San Francisco. "It shows that elements of addiction related to screen use are more strongly predictive of poorer mental health and even suicide risk compared to just screen time. So, I think that it provides more nuance."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A large study known as ABCD&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Xiao and her colleagues used data from a large-scale ongoing longitudinal study called the &lt;a href="https://abcdstudy.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It's been following thousands of kids over the years, and assessing them periodically for both their average daily screen time as well as for symptoms of addiction, which also allowed them to see how these addictive behaviors changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They assessed addiction with a standardized questionnaire asking them to respond to statements like, "'I spend a lot of time thinking about social media apps or planning to use the social media apps,'" explains Xiao. "'I try to use the social media app less, but I can't.' And also 'I feel stressed and or upset if I am not allowed to use my social media apps' or 'I use it so much already it has a bad effect on my schoolwork.'"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Her team was able to group the teens based on how these answers changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With social media, they found that almost 60% had low levels of addiction to social media and that stayed stable over the years. But about a tenth had increasing addiction that peaked around year three and four of the study, and a third showed increasing addiction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With mobile phone use, about half showed high addiction and a quarter had increasing addiction. With video games, they found only two groups — with about 60% showing low addiction that stayed stable over time, and 41% were highly addicted to it through the period.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Questions about suicidal behavior&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study also evaluated suicidal thoughts and behaviors. It uses a questionnaire that asked about passive and active thoughts of suicide, as well as any suicide attempts. At year four of the study, nearly 18% reported having had suicidal thoughts, and 5% admitted to suicidal behaviors, which includes making suicide plans and attempts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The groups with high and increasing addiction to mobile phone and social media were associated with a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The highly addictive group for video games also had a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors compared to the group with low addictive use. However, total screen time was not linked to a higher suicide risk.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What surprised us is that these are substantial groups, and they are associated with 2 to 3 times [risk] of suicidal behaviors," says Xiao.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Screen time is not inherently good or bad&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers, educators, and parents often point to the amount of time teens spend on their screens to gauge problematic use, say Xiao and Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We all get reports from our phones about our weekly screen time," says Nagata. "Screen time is an easily understandable metric because it's minutes or hours a day that we're spending on screens."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But, he adds, screen time isn't inherently good or bad, so he welcomes the nuance this study adds to the conversation since it flags signs of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Some kids might spend their time on screen reading the news, and some might be trolling some pretty dangerous sites," says psychologist &lt;a href="https://mitch.web.unc.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mitch Prinstein&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "So it's really hard to know what to make of screen time as a risk factor."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's why screen time alone is "not a helpful measure," says psychologist Mary Alvord. It's more important to understand how a teen is using their screen time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They may be talking to a friend, but are they talking to a friend I-R-L, or are they talking to an avatar created by AI?" says Alvord. "And are they using screens to avoid things in real life?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Avoidance of real life is a red flag&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the statements in the addictive use questionnaire is: "I play video games so I can forget about my problems."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Avoidance is a key symptom of both anxiety and depression," says Alvord, and it is revelatory about a teen's mental health status and relationship with video games or screens in general.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're starting to really try and understand what are the specific features or the specific behaviors that might be more concerning," explains Prinstein, who has co-chaired the American Psychological Association's &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/social-media-internet/health-advisory-adolescent-social-media-use.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;advisory panel on social media use in adolescents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "And the extent to which kids say, 'I can't stop even when I'm trying to. I'm having withdrawal, dependence, tolerance symptoms,' that's important."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nagata has also used data from the ABCD study&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9243697/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; to understand how teens are using social media&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over time and how that's affecting their risk of mental health symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One thing that was really striking to me is that, unfortunately, these symptoms of screen addictions are actually pretty common," says Nagata. He also found that some of the symptoms get more common over time.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues found that 47.5% of 11-12 year olds said that "I lose track of how much I am using my phone," 22.5% said "I spend a lot of time thinking about social media apps or planning my use of social media apps" and 18.4% said "I use social media apps so I can forget about my problems."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;By age 12-13, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9243697/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;25% said they use social media to forget about their problems&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and 25% admitted to spending a considerable amount of time thinking about social media apps.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Using the same data from the ABCD study, he and his colleagues also found that time on social media increased for preteens over the course of the study. "At the beginning of the study, the average time was only 7 minutes a day, but four years later, the average time was over 70 minutes a day."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2834349?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=052125" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; the more time these kids spent on social media&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the more their depressive symptoms increased.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Parents, teachers, clinicians should be, on the lookout for warning signs for screen addictions, particularly as they may relate to higher depression risk or suicide risk in teenagers," Nagata says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brain might have a hidden "off switch" for binge drinking, and it seems to be governed by fewer than 500 brain cells, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published June 10 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1821025981045921917&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41593-025-01970-x%23Sec10&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Falcohol%2Fthe-brain-might-have-a-hidden-off-switch-for-binge-drinking" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01970-x#Sec10" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41593-025-01970-x%23Sec10&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Falcohol%2Fthe-brain-might-have-a-hidden-off-switch-for-binge-drinking" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, found that in mice, activating or blocking this unique cluster of brain cells, or neurons, can suppress or unleash binge drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the same "off switch" can be found in humans, this tiny neural circuit could become a new target for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we have learned over the past five to 10 years is that the diversity [of the brain] is absolutely staggering, and it doesn't take many neurons to control behaviors," lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.umassmed.edu/display/133252" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.umassmed.edu/display/133252" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gilles Martin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of neurobiology at UMass Chan Medical School, told Live Science. "This study seems to really agree with that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-brake-in-the-brain-3"&gt;A brake in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past decade, scientists have suspected that the medial orbitofrontal cortex — a brain region that helps weigh whether a reward is worth its negative consequences — has been involved in binge drinking. But until now, they didn't have the technical know-how to understand what was going on inside this region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, using new mice that had been genetically engineered to have the molecular equivalent of a genetic light switch, Martin and his colleagues looked for hidden structures inside this complex web of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used optogenetics — a technique in which light stimulation can be used to switch certain genes on or off — to identify in real time which brain cells lit up in response to alcohol consumption. They could then excite or suppress that region of the brain to see how it affected the mice's behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-tNw8KSbLTmUUdd5xdCMcnE" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-tNw8KSbLTmUUdd5xdCMcnE slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that a tiny cluster, made up of about 4% of the medial orbitofrontal cortex, lit up when the mice drank alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/alcohol/what-counts-as-binge-drinking-what-about-high-intensity-drinking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/alcohol/what-counts-as-binge-drinking-what-about-high-intensity-drinking"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What counts as 'binge drinking'? What about 'high-intensity drinking'?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the scientists switched off that cluster, the mice's drinking went "up and up and up" every week, Martin said. When those neurons were switched on, the mice drank a lot less. This suggests the cluster acts as a "built-in brake mechanism that was previously unknown," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manipulation of this cluster did not seem to affect other behaviors, and the study showed it didn't change how much water the mice drank or how much they moved around, Martin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's the first instance where a drug of abuse turns on a bunch of neurons that will actually counter its effects," Martin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to see whether humans also have such an off switch. But if confirmed, these findings could help explain why some people have a harder time resisting binge drinking than others: This brain circuit could be less active in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If people don't have these aversive negative cues, this can promote excessive alcohol drinking," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/people/profile.html?id=dwerner" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/people/profile.html?id=dwerner" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;David Werner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of psychology who studies the neurobiology of alcohol use at Binghamton University in New York and was not involved in the study, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research on this "unique" subset of neurons, Werner added, could reveal new treatment targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="surprising-findings-3"&gt;Surprising findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that these off-switch neurons were found in the prefrontal cortex was the most surprising finding of all, Martin said. Past studies have shown that these inhibitory neurons, which create aversions to certain behaviors or experiences, were usually found in other brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see what is happening in people who binge drink repeatedly over a long period, Martin said, as the study did not investigate what happens after long-term stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another surprise was that this cluster of neurons also seems to be alcohol-specific. In the study, the activation of the cluster did not change the mice's consumption of saccharine — which is essentially sugar, another stimulant with a strong reward feedback loop, Martin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My hunch is now that each drug will probably activate a very distinct neuronal ensemble," Martin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Werner noted that alcohol has "a number of targets" in the human brain. For him, it will be very interesting to examine how this cluster fits into the picture of alcohol use disorder that includes all of these brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What is going to cause one person to have alcohol use disorder is not going to work for the next," Werner speculated.&lt;/p&gt;

The serious mood disorder causes a persistent feeling of sadness and a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that were once enjoyable. The most common treatments for MDD include talk therapy and medications such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and both can take a long time to show any benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When early studies hinted at psilocybin's potential as an antidepressant, a team of researchers undertook the first-ever randomized clinical trial to explore the use of the psychedelic for treating severe depression. The trial included 24 patients, half of whom received psilocybin at the very start of the trial and half of whom received the same dose eight weeks later—the "waitlist" group. Each patient also received 11 hours of psychotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in that short time frame, "there was a significant reduction in depression in the immediate-treatment group compared to those on the waitlist," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://csw.osu.edu/faculty/davis-alan/" target="_blank" data-url="https://csw.osu.edu/faculty/davis-alan/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alan Davis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for Psychedelic Drug Research and Education at The Ohio State University, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once all of the patients had completed the four-week study, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2772630" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2772630" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the psilocybin appeared to be four times more effective than traditional antidepressant medications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, based on &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/185157" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/185157" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;previous research data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. One month after the treatment, 17 patients had relieved symptoms, including 14 who were in full remission from depression. Patients also responded much faster to psilocybin than is typical for conventional antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But do these benefits of psilocybin last?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/magic-mushrooms-temporarily-dissolve-brain-network-responsible-for-sense-of-self" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/magic-mushrooms-temporarily-dissolve-brain-network-responsible-for-sense-of-self"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magic mushrooms temporarily 'dissolve' brain network responsible for sense of self&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-vdxzPVjowkrc8EBRv8BNgS" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-vdxzPVjowkrc8EBRv8BNgS slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very few long-term studies of psilocybin for depression have been conducted to date, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.psychiatry.wisc.edu/staff/raison-m-d-charles-l/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.psychiatry.wisc.edu/staff/raison-m-d-charles-l/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Charles Raison&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of human ecology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are very difficult to do because people drop out," Raison told Live Science in an email. "But also because they go on all sorts of other treatments that obfuscate the degree to which any longer lasting benefits result from the psychedelic or because the participant got therapy or restarted an antidepressant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether the benefits for psilocybin lasted and if the patients had experienced any side effects, the researchers contacted the original trial participants several years later to request their enrollment in a follow-up study. Twenty-one patients enrolled, and their clinicians rated any changes in the participants' levels of depression from before the original treatment to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients also filled out a series of self-reported, online questionnaires and met up with clinicians to document their ability to engage in everyday tasks, their levels of anxiety and their general mental health. The researchers assumed that the three patients that didn’t sign up for the follow up, and the three that didn’t complete the questionnaires had not remained in remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the researchers found that 67% of the participants who had suffered from depression half a decade earlier remained in remission after a single psychedelic therapy session. These patients also reported less anxiety and less difficulty functioning on a daily basis. In general, the two-thirds of the patients who responded well reported lasting positive changes in their mindsets, emotional health and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm excited by these deeper aspects of their lives that really speaks to the importance of these interventions beyond just reduction of depression," Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the patients shared that, following the original treatment, they'd engaged in self-reflection and therapy to help understand themselves and navigate life's challenges. Davis hypothesizes that the psychedelic experience catalyzes a deeper therapy process and would like to conduct future studies comparing the relative influences of psilocybin and psychotherapy in alleviating depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest caveat of this study is the small sample size, and the fact that the original trial showed larger antidepressant effects than subsequent larger multi-site studies seem to be showing," Raison said. In a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2206443" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2206443" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;multi-site clinical trial&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with 233 participants, 37% of the 79 who received a single 25 mg dose of psilocybin, coupled with psychotherapy, went into remission from major depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these trials report less widespread antidepressant effects, they support the idea that psilocybin can effectively treat depression, Davis said, and he is keen to see how the findings of multi-site trials hold up five years post-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warning: Photos of addictively smooth skin ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tired of paying for pricey in-office chemical peels? Me too. Though they’re unmatched for &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB/p/noble-panacea-the-brilliant-discovery-ritual-prod277570094" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;minimizing pores and fine lines&lt;/a&gt; and smoothening and brightening skin, the cost and time commitment are a bit much.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So it felt serendipitous when the editor-approved &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;Noble Panacea Overnight Chronobiology Peel&lt;/a&gt; came my way. The &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/style/best-anti-aging-skincare-products-per-celebrities/"&gt;celeb-approved skincare&lt;/a&gt; has graced the &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/05/22/style/noble-panacea-at-home-peel-works-overnight/"&gt;ageless faces of Salma Hayek and Jenna Lyons&lt;/a&gt; — plus supermodel Christy Turlington is such a fan, she’s even partnered with the brand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Did my skin-goals celeb crushes know something that I didn’t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;




&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;Overnight Chronobiology Peel&lt;/a&gt; is an at-home chemical peel created to work while you sleep, and each package includes eight treatments. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Made with Organic Super Molecular Vessels (OSMV), it’s designed to deliver active ingredients via tiny cells that are 10,000 times smaller than a skin cell. It  also contains AHAs and BHA to target a plethora of skin woes, including &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;fine lines, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, acne scars, enlarged pores and uneven skin tone&lt;/a&gt;. (It’s meant to work with your sleep cycle, releasing soothing agents towards the end.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;The heavy-duty sustainable packaging&lt;/a&gt; opens to packets of a clear, unscented gel, packed with enough product to apply on your face, neck and décolleté. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first time I slathered it on, I immediately felt a tingle — a must for me to feel like it’s working. You leave it on for five to ten minutes before applying your regular night cream (though the instructions say don’t use it with retinol or other AHAs).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over my 10 minutes of use, the sensation was there but not uncomfortable; it was on par with what I’ve experienced in a doctor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I dozed off to bed, I noticed a glassy, taught look to my face. Hoping for the best, I said a little prayer,&lt;em&gt; “Lord, make me glowy.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was a bit concerned that I had tried it the night before an event — and didn’t want to wake up looking burned or flaky — thankfully that wasn’t an issue; the next morning, I awoke to slightly pink cheeks, and my pores seemed to have run away, as I couldn’t find them anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eager for more benefits, I promptly contacted &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB/c/designers-noble-panacea-cat82890746"&gt;Noble Panacea to ask &lt;/a&gt;if I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; wait a full week for the next application. The brand confirmed that if the first treatment doesn’t cause much sensitivity, two times per week is fine. I gleefully applied again after four days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My skin began to acclimate, and it was a little less spicy the second time. I followed the same steps and awoke to glowy, soft and poreless skin — now, I’m hooked. Since I’m of the baby-oil-over-SPF generation, I have plenty of &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB/c/designers-noble-panacea-cat82890746" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;sun damage that I’m hoping to say goodbye to, thanks to this peel. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also of note? For a “peel,” my skin doesn’t peel at all, which was unexpected — routine-wise, it’s more like using a mask. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While I’ve only applied it three times thus far, based on the results, I can’t wait to finish the treatment. According to the brand’s clinical trials, the results &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;start showing after four uses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Final Verdict&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB/c/designers-noble-panacea-cat82890746" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;Noble Panacea was developed&lt;/a&gt; by a Nobel-prize-winning chemist, Sir Fraser Stoddart, with a science-based approach to skincare. Despite its lab origins, the line is made with non-irritating, planet- and human-friendly ingredients and is cruelty-free.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While I’ve tested my fair share of luxe skincare as a beauty editor, this overnight treatment has me waking up like I just got my favorite Hydrofacial: smooth, bright and soft, without any real irritation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though not &lt;em&gt;inexpensive&lt;/em&gt;, it certainly saves me a bundle from seeing a facialist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a gentle yet effective anti-aging treatment that can be done from the comfort of your home, &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ESXXYSUB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;consider Noble Panacea’s The Exceptional Overnight Chronobiology Peel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Last weekend, our 8-year-old son, “Dion,” and his friend, “Mason” (also 8), were playing in the wooded area behind our home. There’s a pond there where the kids like to catch frogs, and the boys had caught one when Mason grabbed something from his bag.&lt;/p&gt;

This happened just as my 12-year-old daughter was coming to look for them. She told my wife, who took Mason home, told his parents what he did and said he could no longer play with Dion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc29ykdv000p3b76phiflkv2@published"&gt;Well, I agree and disagree with both of you. I do think it’s &lt;em&gt;definitely bad&lt;/em&gt; to do what these two kids did, rather than just being an ill-advised “stunt.” But I also think that humans have a somewhat natural impulse to treat small animals as, in essence, toys rather than living things, and that this doesn’t necessarily mean that anyone involved is headed toward being strapped to a chair in a maximum-security prison like Hannibal Lecter.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc29ykfa000q3b76vryqpwvx@published"&gt;I think the important immediate question, then, isn’t whether Mason and Dion can ever see each other again, but how they feel about what happened. Were they remorseful or upset? Do they understand why this is in the category of things you shouldn’t do? Have they expressed self-directed intent not to do something like it again? If so, I don’t see why they shouldn’t be allowed to play together again, though perhaps after a cooling-off period and with some more adult oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

We first realized this about two years ago, and the problem has only gotten worse, as the star has become more … prolific. Any search of the name yields only pages and pages of the star’s porn links. There’s no shortened form or nickname, and our son has no middle name, so we don’t have options but to legally change it. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/11/make-child-change-name-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;The problem is our son does not want to do this.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Cancer is just everywhere,” said Kerri Johannsen, senior director of policy at the Iowa Environmental Council, a non-profit focused on improving the environment that is helping to lead the project. “Every person I talk to knows somebody that has [recently] had a cancer diagnosis,” she said. “It’s just a constant drumbeat.

Last year, a state report &lt;a href="https://shri.public-health.uiowa.edu/2024/02/20/iowa-cancer-registry-issues-cancer-in-iowa-2024-report-highlights-alcohol-related-cancers/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cited alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt; as a key factor. Higher-than-average levels of radon, a naturally occurring, colorless gas known to cause cancer,&lt;a href="https://canceriowa.org/radon/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; is also a concern.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But many residents blame the insecticides, herbicides and other pesticides widely used on farms as well as the state’s persistent problem with high levels of hazardous nitrates that wash off farm fields into the state’s water supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As a key US farm state, Iowa has long been known for the leafy green stalks of corn that stretch seemingly endlessly across the horizon. With&lt;a href="https://www.iowafarmbureau.com/Farm-Facts#:~:text=1)%20Iowa%20Agriculture%3A%20A%20National,other%20state%20in%20the%20country." data-link-name="in body link"&gt; nearly 87,000 farms&lt;/a&gt;, the state ranks first not only for corn production but also for pork and egg production, and is within the top five states for growing soybeans and raising cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Of Iowa’s 35.7m acres of total land, roughly&lt;a href="https://www.lhf.org/learning-fields/crops/iowa-farm-facts/#:~:text=35.7%20million:%20Acres%20of%20land,345%20acres:%20Average%20farm%20size" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; 31m is devoted to farming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Many of the pesticides routinely used are linked to a &lt;a href="https://aghealth.nih.gov/news/publications.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;range of diseases,&lt;/a&gt; including the popular herbicide glyphosate, which&lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MonographVolume112-1.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; is classified&lt;/a&gt; as a probable human carcinogen by cancer experts at the World Health Organization. Nitrates are also&lt;a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/prevention/chemical_exposures/nitrate" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; tied to cancer&lt;/a&gt;, particularly when consumed in drinking water or other dietary sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Agricultural fertilizers and manure from large-scale livestock operations are&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0033350624000131?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; key sources for nitrates,&lt;/a&gt; which are known to contaminate surface water and groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f56d697b-c5e4-44be-9c8d-a1f96825214c" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Dianne Chmabers reading to her grandchild as she recovered from cancer treatment on Christmas morning in 2015.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Courtesy Dianne Chambers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In addition to looking at pesticides and nitrates, the research will also look at cancer links to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/14/pfas-sewage-fertilizer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; warned of elevated cancer risks&lt;/a&gt; related to such farm fertilizer contaminated with PFAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The work will also include a deeper look at the state’s high levels of radon as a key cancer cause, said Elise Pohl, former community health consultant for the Iowa department of health who is the lead researcher for the project. Radon, a leading cause of lung cancer, is particularly high across Iowa, with approximately &lt;a href="https://hhs.iowa.gov/radiological-health/radon/radon-resources" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;50% of homes&lt;/a&gt; facing radon levels above federal regulatory action levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We really want to find out why these cancers are increasing,” Pohl said. “We’re homing in on the agriculture side of things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The focus on agricultural practices as a potential cause for the high cancer rates is controversial, according to Adam Shriver, director of wellness and nutrition at the Harkin Institute who is helping lead the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Agriculture contributes an estimated $159.5bn to the state’s economy – roughly one-third of Iowa’s total economic output,&lt;a href="https://www.iowafarmbureau.com/Farm-Facts#:~:text=1)%20Iowa%20Agriculture%3A%20A%20National,other%20state%20in%20the%20country." data-link-name="in body link"&gt; according to&lt;/a&gt; the Iowa Farm Bureau. And the industry influence is potent, according to Shriver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In most people’s minds, you escape to the country for healthy, clean living and yet … the elephant in the room is that we’ve been practicing industrial agriculture and we’ve had a government that has been subservient to big agriculture and they’ve been allowed to do whatever they want,” Shriver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Iowa Farmers Union policy director, Tommy Hextel, said many farmers were worried about the health impacts of their use of pesticides but were reluctant to be too vocal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We have a lot of folks who are conventional farmers who are concerned about this,” said Hextel. “They’re worried about cancer in their families. But they don’t want to be outspoken about an industry that supplies them essential tools.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Several farm organizations were asked for their views on the new study and fears of ties between agriculture and cancer, but only one, the Iowa Corn Growers Association, responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4a0d9f92-4801-4eef-ae49-61c8d312b3f7" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Audience members and staff listen to a presentation during an edge-of-field workshop at the Ames water treatment plant 2 March 2023, in Ames, Iowa.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Charlie Neibergall/AP&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re interested in looking at all potential causes of cancer,” said Rodney Williamson, the association’s vice-president of research and sustainability. He cited smoking, radon, obesity, tanning beds and alcohol as additional potential causes to consider. “We should be looking at all of those.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He said when it comes to pesticides, the association urges farmers to follow the recommendations of the EPA, which does “an extensive review” of pesticides for potential carcinogenicity, and to ensure that they apply pesticides appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="wondering-and-worrying" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wondering and worrying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At last week’s listening session in Indianola, Chambers described how she was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 50. She lives about 20 miles south of Indianola, where she and her husband farm roughly 1,000 acres. She said many others in her area have also suffered from cancers, and though she does not know what caused her illness, which is now at bay, she stays far from farm chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Do I think it’s chemicals? Do I worry about the water?” she asked rhetorically. “I do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Funded with donations from individuals and foundations, the research team plans to produce a report based on a broad review of years of published scientific studies as well as the anecdotal information gleaned in the listening sessions. The researchers hope to release some initial findings later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Richard Deming, a cancer doctor in Iowa for 36 years, said he donated personal funds to the project because he feels more independent research is needed to inform policies that can help cut the cancer rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s not trying to throw any industry under the bus. But, lots of people now are scratching their heads,” he said. “As a cancer doctor taking care of patients, I have the opportunity one patient at a time to try to help … But if you can prevent cancers you can actually make a bigger difference than treating each cancer that comes into your office.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is co-published with the &lt;a href="https://www.thenewlede.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New Lede&lt;/a&gt;, a journalism project of the Environmental Working Group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 20:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBiSzViT2EtV08xVWFOVGpDMC0zQVNoME5lcDA1UmxNdmpUSy1IaEVSOWNBTVhacDVNaVphQ0xZUFpJdmEwMGtJRlJIY09yVXFzbXhzcm8tZVAySUh3VE5KZVBJYUt4SFJvSXpNelplQ3RNRm1GZUVGRGdSZWNYaU0</guid></item><item><title>耳垢揭示帕金森病生物标志物-神经科学新闻 | Ear Wax Reveals Parkinson’s Disease Biomarkers - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE0zR3hyaDJuLThlZUVfTC1IY2JiTndkemJWTTY4WVNaZVZscW1zS01VZXRTNjN0el9OdUdROWJZTGtVX1A5dE5nZzZNa3F0NE1BbWpPVmtPcFJfNjdDSTh1V3hHQ3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A novel screening method for Parkinson’s disease (PD) analyzes the volatile compounds in ear wax to detect early signs of the condition. Researchers found that four specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are significantly different in people with PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this information, they developed an AI-powered olfactory system that distinguished between PD and non-PD samples with 94% accuracy.

Early intervention for the neurological disease that worsens over time is therefore critical to optimize care, but that requires early diagnosis. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current tests, like clinical rating scales and neural imaging, can be subjective and costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111010"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows a person cleaning their ear." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/parkinsons-ear-wax-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The AIO system, the researchers say, could be used as a first-line screening tool for early PD detection and could pave the way for early medical intervention, thereby improving patient care. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers in ACS’ &lt;em&gt;Analytical Chemistry&lt;/em&gt; report the initial development of a system that inexpensively screens for PD from the odors in a person’s ear wax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown that changes in sebum, an oily substance secreted by the skin, could help identify people with PD. Specifically, sebum from people with PD may have a characteristic smell because volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by sebum are altered by disease progression — including neurodegeneration, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when sebum on the skin is exposed to environmental factors like air pollution and humidity, its composition can be altered, making it an unreliable testing medium. But the skin inside the ear canal is kept away from the elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Hao Dong, Danhua Zhu and colleagues wanted to focus their PD screening efforts on ear wax, which mostly consists of sebum and is easily sampled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify potential VOCs related to PD in ear wax, the researchers swabbed the ear canals of 209 human subjects (108 of whom were diagnosed with PD). They analyzed the collected secretions using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four of the VOCs the researchers found in ear wax from people with PD were significantly different than the ear wax from people without the disease. They concluded that these four VOCs, including ethylbenzene, 4-ethyltoluene, pentanal, and 2-pentadecyl-1,3-dioxolane, are potential biomarkers for PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dong, Zhu and colleagues then trained an artificial intelligence olfactory (AIO) system with their ear wax VOC data. The resulting AIO-based screening model categorized with 94% accuracy ear wax samples from people with and without PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AIO system, the researchers say, could be used as a first-line screening tool for early PD detection and could pave the way for early medical intervention, thereby improving patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This method is a small-scale single-center experiment in China,” says Dong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next step is to conduct further research at different stages of the disease, in multiple research centers and among multiple ethnic groups, in order to determine whether this method has greater practical application value.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The authors acknowledge funding from the National Natural Sciences Foundation of Science, Pioneer and Leading Goose R&amp;amp;D Program of Zhejiang Province, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Parkinson’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#adc8f2cccfcfc2d9d9edcccede83c2dfca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emily Abbott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://acs.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ACS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Emily Abbott – ACS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c00908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;An Artificial Intelligence Olfactory-Based Diagnostic Model for Parkinson’s Disease Using Volatile Organic Compounds from Ear Canal Secretions&lt;/a&gt;” by Danhua Zhu et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analytical Chemistry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Artificial Intelligence Olfactory-Based Diagnostic Model for Parkinson’s Disease Using Volatile Organic Compounds from Ear Canal Secretions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s Disease (PD), a frequently diagnosed neurodegenerative condition, poses a major global challenge. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for PD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study proposes a diagnostic model for PD that analyzes volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from ear canal secretions (ECS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to examine ECS samples from patients, four VOC components (ethylbenzene, 4-ethyltoluene, pentanal, and 2-pentadecyl-1,3-dioxolane) were identified as biomarkers with statistically significant differences between PD and non-PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic models based on these VOC components demonstrate strong capability in identifying and classifying PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the PD diagnostic model, this study introduces a protocol for extracting features from chromatographic data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By integrating gas chromatography–surface acoustic wave sensors (GC-SAW) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, the system achieves an accuracy of up to 94.4%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further enhancements to the diagnostic model could pave the way for a promising new PD diagnostic solution and the clinical use of a bedside PD diagnostic device.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 20:30:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE0zR3hyaDJuLThlZUVfTC1IY2JiTndkemJWTTY4WVNaZVZscW1zS01VZXRTNjN0el9OdUdROWJZTGtVX1A5dE5nZzZNa3F0NE1BbWpPVmtPcFJfNjdDSTh1V3hHQ3c</guid></item><item><title>与癌症相关的饮料、负面想法的影响以及保护听力的方法-福克斯新闻 | Drink linked to cancer, impact of negative thoughts and ways to protect hearing - Fox News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPMzhwd3B6cjVkOVI0MjhPckNHQk9naGwzZXhBUkJ3bzRySUJvYVA0Q2V5LUpGT3hDV1hHRV9UNzBpbmtVYjVPQUR3WlM0eHpzbi1JNEFwWGZVSHpkS2pzVVRYZDVDaGRNcnhKbUJ2aXNObmFhdG93dGdQSDB1N09mcjk1TGZDWU9ZQmFmMk1iWWQ5c3JwTVhKVWlxOEzSAaIBQVVfeXFMTWRrd2NaUi1nSnM1ZExDaWdqeGc3d1drR3kwekhNVWtZSS03ZHd5RlYtN3F2bFBPMDRSdHFFMGpYSmw1OUIwQWpfRllnYloyalBTVmNtYmRZRVVLN3dBOG5QUC1ZblhCVml3YTZYWWRKWDQ4c2s3dWxKaWppcW1od1dUSm10bl8tQm5NbmtSS3kxamM0WWVXR2tJY3RkZkJENVZ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fox News</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 20:07:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPMzhwd3B6cjVkOVI0MjhPckNHQk9naGwzZXhBUkJ3bzRySUJvYVA0Q2V5LUpGT3hDV1hHRV9UNzBpbmtVYjVPQUR3WlM0eHpzbi1JNEFwWGZVSHpkS2pzVVRYZDVDaGRNcnhKbUJ2aXNObmFhdG93dGdQSDB1N09mcjk1TGZDWU9ZQmFmMk1iWWQ5c3JwTVhKVWlxOEzSAaIBQVVfeXFMTWRrd2NaUi1nSnM1ZExDaWdqeGc3d1drR3kwekhNVWtZSS03ZHd5RlYtN3F2bFBPMDRSdHFFMGpYSmw1OUIwQWpfRllnYloyalBTVmNtYmRZRVVLN3dBOG5QUC1ZblhCVml3YTZYWWRKWDQ4c2s3dWxKaWppcW1od1dUSm10bl8tQm5NbmtSS3kxamM0WWVXR2tJY3RkZkJENVZ3</guid></item><item><title>一名俄克拉荷马州蹒跚学步的孩子在基斯通湖游泳后感染了多种大肠杆菌，为自己的生命而战-雅虎 | An Oklahoma toddler fights for her life after contracting multiple strains of E. coli after swimming at Keystone Lake - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE9JcXhjQTI2SWZjWmMzUE5DaXNWWkx2cE41bmNlcVBTZS1Sd2twOTNTWWdXSW5FcFZSek1lbFFGUzR5cXVteVBLVC15TF83ZFppSUpNNlJJMDZGRVZDejV5dGd0UmVJZWRMTWxRQmdTVzMzNGJ4MkcxY09IUjdPR00?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A 2-year-old is fighting for her life after contracting three strains of &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/newborn-died-within-hours-doctor-194308587.html" data-ylk="slk:E. coli;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;E. coli&lt;/a&gt; while swimming in Keystone Lake, her family says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Toddler Elisabeth Faircloth was swimming and boating with her family in &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/oklahoma-grayson-african-abraham-lincoln-juneteenth-b2771794.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Oklahoma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; in early June when she started feeling sick.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tattoos have always been a part of human culture, with some examples dating back &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/ancient-tattoos-lasers-peru-mummies-2b6c0dd724e18af39727553721075449"&gt;thousands of years&lt;/a&gt;.

Over the past 20 years, shifting attitudes and a surge in interest have fueled the growth of tattoo culture, and Houston's scene has grown right along with it.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Houston Matters producer Brenda Valdivia met the new wave of artists working in the industry at the &lt;a href="https://villainarts.com/tattoo-conventions-villain-arts/houston-tattoo-arts-convention/"&gt;Villain Arts 7th Annual Houston Tattoo Arts Festival&lt;/a&gt;. She also spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/oyetewa-asempa-132861"&gt;Dr. Oyetewa Asempa, Director of the Skin of Color Clinic at Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, on how to keep tattoos fresh and the skin they're inked on healthy. You can hear those conversations in the audio above.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things to Keep in Mind to Keep Your Tattooed Skin Healthy and Fresh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red tattoo ink is the most likely color to trigger an allergic reaction—sometimes even weeks or years after getting the tattoo—especially for individuals who begin antiretroviral treatment for HIV or undergo joint replacement surgery, according to Dr. Asempa. She recommends checking the tattoo parlor's hygiene practices, reading online reviews, and asking trusted friends for artist recommendations before booking an appointment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="721" data-end="741"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="721" data-end="741"&gt;Things to Avoid:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="743" data-end="1042"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="743" data-end="823"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="745" data-end="823"&gt;Swimming or sweating soon after getting a tattoo until it fully heals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="824" data-end="882"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="826" data-end="882"&gt;Repeated exposure to UV light, such as direct sunlight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="883" data-end="965"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="885" data-end="965"&gt;Using petroleum-based products on your skin. Use water-based lotion instead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="966" data-end="1042"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="968" data-end="1042"&gt;Tattooing over moles or areas of skin with a high concentration of moles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Tattoos are obscuring moles and we can’t properly evaluate them," Dr. Asempa says. "We can’t see if they’re changing color, then people may get a delayed diagnosis of melanoma, which is the deadliest form of skin cancer."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="1044" data-end="1552"&gt;While precautions are important, many people enjoy their tattoos and the camaraderie tattoos foster within their communities. Dr. Carl Blasphemy, master of ceremonies and host for Villain Arts at the Houston Tattoo Arts Festival, shared: "My wife has the coordinates and time of when we got married tattooed on her arm, along with the date in Roman numerals. You really can’t tell what it is unless you ask her about it, because people want to share the story behind their tattoos."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1554" data-end="1890"&gt;While some tattoos are bright, colorful works of art, others serve practical purposes, such as permanent makeup. These include eyebrow tattoos and permanent lipstick, as explained by Samantha Aquiningoc of Immortal Essence Cosmetics: "Often, it's more mature clients who have thinning brows or clients who want full color on their lips."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1892" data-end="1944"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1892" data-end="1944"&gt;Tattoo Artists and Festival Organizers Featured:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 variant that may be driving &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-variant-who-285a4e5146aa4a7ccb252e38accd5959"&gt;a recent rise in cases&lt;/a&gt; in some parts of the world has earned a new nickname: “razor blade throat” COVID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s because the variant — NB.1.8.1. or “Nimbus” — may cause painful sore throats. The symptom has been identified by doctors in the United Kingdom, India and elsewhere, according to media outlets in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other COVID-19 symptoms of any variant include fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath or loss of taste or smell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts say there isn’t major cause for concern with the Nimbus variant, but here ‘s what else you need to know about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Here’s where the variant causing ‘razor blade throat’ is spreading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON572"&gt;The rise in cases&lt;/a&gt; late last month is primarily in eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and western Pacific regions, the World Health Organization said May 28. The new variant had reached nearly 11% of sequenced samples reported globally in mid-May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airport screening &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-pandemic-masks-anniversary-34f2fb0ea729e71c0809295d3e62744b"&gt;in the United States&lt;/a&gt; detected the new variant in travelers arriving from those regions to destinations in California, Washington state, Virginia and New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You aren’t likely to get sicker from this variant than others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so far, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO said some western Pacific countries have reported increases in COVID cases and hospitalizations, but there’s nothing so far to suggest that the disease associated with the new variant is more severe compared to other variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;COVID-19 vaccines are effective against the Nimbus variant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO has designated Nimbus as a “variant under monitoring” and considers the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;public health risk low at the global level&lt;/a&gt;. Current vaccines are expected to remain effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-70c358cad726e57d680234c3ecdec926"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last month that COVID-19 shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women — a move immediately questioned by public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;

Health professionals, however, indicate that various routine tendencies—silently neglected—are capable of subtly damaging this vital body organ. The liver is an integral part of assimilating nutrients, detoxifying toxins, and balancing metabolism. But other behaviours such as consuming excessive sugar, use of typical painkillers, and spending too much time sitting can all harm the liver. And often, the damage creeps up gradually, symptom-free, until it's too late. These are the things you should know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6 liver-damaging habits that have nothing to do with alcohol&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1. Too much sugar can cause fatty liver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming high amounts of added sugar—particularly from processed foods and sweetened beverages—can overwhelm the liver. Perhaps the greatest threat is fructose, a form of sugar that the liver converts to fat. If this accumulation goes on over time, it can result in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), leading to inflammation and scarring. Blood sugar spikes also cause insulin resistance, which causes the liver to work more than it must.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Abusing painkillers overstrains liver function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overuse of over-the-counter pain medications such as acetaminophen or paracetamol is a widespread but underappreciated risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver metabolises these drugs, which creates toxic waste products as a byproduct. When the liver is unable to eliminate these rapidly enough, they start to destroy liver cells and disrupt function. This is particularly hazardous in combination with other stressors such as alcohol or long-term disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Sitting too much increases liver fat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of physical activity may not seem like a direct cause of liver damage, but it plays a major role. A sedentary lifestyle leads to weight gain, insulin resistance, and fat accumulation—all of which are key drivers of fatty liver disease. Regular movement helps burn excess fat and supports liver function. Even light daily activity can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Unregulated supplements carry hidden dangers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural is not always safe. Most herbal or Ayurvedic supplements are not regulated and can contain toxic substances or contaminants such as heavy metals or steroids. Some of these chemicals are poisons to liver cells, particularly when they are taken regularly or without medical supervision. In some instances, supplements have led to inflammation of the liver or even liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;5. Crash dieting can backfire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severe dieting or fasting can upset the balance of the liver. When the body is abruptly cut off from calories, the liver can dump fat stored there into the bloodstream. This raises fat accumulation in cells of the liver and strains the organ. Crash diets also disrupt the production of bile and lower the detoxifying capacity of the liver for the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;6. Smoking puts additional toxins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cigarette smoke brings in toxins that raise oxidative stress and lower blood flow to the liver. Such alteration can harm liver tissue and enhance the likelihood of fibrosis over time. Additionally, the liver has to function harder to metabolise the chemicals from the smoke, placing further burden on the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to stop liver damage before it starts&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most insidious things about liver damage is the way it happens quietly.

Cartilage can’t repair itself like other tissues in the body and, oftentimes, people don’t know they’ve lost the cartilage in their knee until it’s gone, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BZOJGUWYRRBWHPHFBXJMCYNJSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are two common risk factors for knee arthritis — a previous knee injury such as an ACL tear and unhealthy weight gain, said &lt;a href="https://hes.wfu.edu/people/faculty/steve-messier/"&gt;Steve Messier&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the J.B.

It’s the first recommendation in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1063458419311161"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; published in 2019 from the Osteoarthritis Research Society International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="33CMXNX6GFBAJIC3RTBTNYBAFI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/osteoarthritis/index.html"&gt;33 million U.S. adults have osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People &lt;a href="https://www.oarsijournal.com/article/S1063-4584(21)00810-4/fulltext"&gt;commonly&lt;/a&gt; take NSAIDs such as ibuprofen to relieve the symptoms.

The idea, hatched on the social media site X, was prompted by responses to an old video of current Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in which he claims that none of vaccines mandated for US children has ever been tested in preclinical studies against a placebo. In one of the &lt;a href="https://x.com/BradSpellberg/status/1914769077102662069"&gt;&lt;span&gt;responses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, infectious disease physician Brad Spellberg, MD, suggested a crowd-sourced effort to identify and post all of the RCTs in which vaccines have been tested against a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That night Scott, a self-proclaimed "spreadsheet geek" who has previously collaborated with Spellberg, began building a spreadsheet using Google Sheets, creating criteria for inclusion, and seeding it with seven vaccine RCTs. Each entry has columns for the name of the vaccine, the date the RCT was published, which populations were studied, how many people were involved in the study and, importantly, the types of placebo or active comparator that were used for the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the next morning, there were 20 vaccine RCTs on the spreadsheet. By May 5, the list had grown to 100. The spreadsheet now stands at more than 270 RCTs and continues to grow. Scott and his colleagues, who aim to eventually publish a peer-reviewed paper on the project in a medical journal, thoroughly review each entry before inclusion and provide links to the RCTs on PubMed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we're kind of looking at the tip of the iceberg," Scott told CIDRAP News. "There's going to be, I would say, easily 400-plus, maybe 500-plus trials with millions and millions of participants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIDRAP News recently spoke with Scott about the project and what he's learned from it. The following excerpts from the conversation have been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CIDRAP News: One of the claims Secretary Kennedy has made, and he said this on May 14th when he was testifying before Congress and in a recent Fox News interview, was that the only vaccine that has been tested in placebo-controlled trials is the COVID vaccine. And he's made variations on that claim in other venues. Based on your review of the RCTs that you've compiled, is that true&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jake Scott: &lt;/strong&gt;It's unequivocally, demonstrably, measurably false. I've looked through this extensively and it's been reported on and I've posted about this…because my biggest fear really in life is being misleading or giving inaccurate information. So I've poured through this, I've looked at the studies, and there are many, many more placebo-controlled vaccine trials. It's just such a misleading claim. Essentially every childhood vaccine has been tested in placebo-controlled trials of some sort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's important to be specific, and I think nuances kind of matter. So when it comes to doing a randomized control trial, if you want to see how well something works, you compare it to a group of people who didn't get that thing. And then you look at the outcomes, right? And you compare the outcomes. RFK Jr. has been quoted as saying the gold standard should be no intervention—you take 100,000 kids, you give them the vaccine, and then you compare it to 100,000 kids who didn't get that vaccine. Well, that is biologically inert, because you're not giving them anything. But then they're not going to be protected if that vaccine does work. There have been trials that have used no intervention. That's his gold standard. And there have been childhood vaccine studies that have compared vaccines to no interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially every childhood vaccine has been tested in placebo-controlled trials of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have also been trials that have compared the vaccine to saline placebo. But saline is not the only placebo. There are other kinds of inert salts and stuff, like calcium carbonate, etc. Then you have aluminum adjuvants, which are considered placebo in the sense that they don't trigger an immune response to that particular thing. They basically nudge the immune system up to provide a better-quality immune response to the antigen, which is the piece of protein or whatever that you want the immune system to target. So when it comes to those definitions, yes, there have been many placebo-controlled vaccine trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's really interesting, in my opinion, is how could you talk about childhood vaccine trials only being placebo-controlled during COVID when you're leaving out the polio trial? The Salk Field trial of 1954 was one of the largest prospective medical trials ever. It was massive. There were about 200,000 kids in 1954 who got saline, and there were 200,000 kids who got vaccine. That was a saline, placebo-controlled trial, and it was massive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I did a thorough analysis [of the spreadsheet] a few days ago, we had 274 total trials—164 of those were placebo controlled, 133 were inert placebo controlled. So about half of all the RCTs that we've seen have been inert placebo-controlled trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CIDRAP News: One of the other claims that that Secretary Kennedy has made is that nobody knows the risk profile of these vaccines, specifically the recommended childhood vaccines. How do you respond to that claim?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jake Scott:&lt;/strong&gt; It is patently false. That's just one of the biggest lies about vaccines that there is because we absolutely do know the safety profiles. Vaccines have been the most thoroughly vetted of all medicines. Not only are the safety profiles being studied during the trials, they're also being monitored after licensure like nothing else. I mean, we have so much more safety data on vaccines than we do on supplements, which a lot of people have no issue taking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-left"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data sheet looks at not only efficacy, but it also lists safety outcomes. And you know, initially, we thought 'that's going to take too much time, let's just focus on efficacy.' We're a team of eight volunteers, you know, and I want to make that clear to the public—we don't get paid. We're not working for pharma. I've never taken a cent from pharma. But Brad [Spellberg] and I were talking and we realized that the question here in most people's minds isn't whether these vaccines are effective and how effective they are, it's are they safe. So we felt obligated to include safety outcome data. It adds a lot more time to our work. And what's crazy is that last I checked, when there were 274 trials, more than 90% of those included safety outcome data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the trials themselves—the vast majority of them—do report safety data. But of course those trials are going to be limited because you can't study a vaccine and compare it to a control group in a million people, or a hundred million people, you know? That would take forever. These trials are typically hundreds [or] thousands of people, sometimes tens of thousands of people, sometimes a hundred thousand plus people like with the polio vaccine. So safety outcome data is going to be limited because of the size…and if there's a very rare safety issue or adverse event that's associated or potentially associated with a vaccine, it's not going to be detected in a trial. It's going to be detected after the trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...we have so much more safety data on vaccines than we do on supplements, which a lot of people have no issue taking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why we have these other layers. Post-licensure safety monitoring layers. That's why we have VAERSs (the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) and VSD (the Vaccine Safety Datalink) and Prism (Post-licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring) and international safety databases. And this is not just the CDC, it's EMA (European Medicines Agency), it's agencies around the world. It's the World Health Organization. And that's how we detect these signals and that's how we act on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the RotaShield vaccine—and we've included the Rotashield trial because we’re not cherry-picking—was withdrawn because there was a safety signal detected after the trial was completed that showed that there was a higher rate of intussusception, which is when the bowel kind of folds in on itself. Other rotavirus vaccines were subsequently developed that have not been shown to have higher incidences of that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine is a perfect example. During the trial, there wasn't a safety signal detected. Afterwards, and pretty quickly afterwards, there were higher rates of blood clots that were noted. That was detected in these post-licensure safety databases. And then it was withdrawn. So post-licensure safety monitoring did exactly what we needed it to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CIDRAP News: There's obviously a lot of concern about vaccine recommendations in this country going forward under Secretary Kennedy, but is there anything good that can come from this, and from you and other infectious disease experts getting out there and sharing the data on vaccines with the public?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jake Scott: &lt;/strong&gt;I'm totally an optimist. I'm a glass-half-full kind of person. And I also think it's important to recognize or try to understand why we are here. There's no doubt in my mind that some of the reason why we're here is because some elements of the COVID response were too much. And people didn't feel like we were being totally transparent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that it's important that we all take stock and think 'why are we here?' Well, we're here because we have lost trust. There's been an erosion of trust that's been profound. And for that reason, it's more important than ever that we don't compromise when it comes to telling the truth and being totally transparent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccinology is super complicated. I mean, I love this stuff, but I'm still constantly learning about it. It's tricky, tricky stuff. But people want information. We cannot be paternalistic and withhold anything. We gotta tell it like it is. Even if it's about something problematic, even if it's recognizing that, yes, there is a risk of myocarditis and yes, the, potential benefit of a COVID booster in an 18-year-old who's healthy is really marginal, if not negligible. Let's just be totally honest. Because if we're not, people are going to realize it and they're going to think that we don't trust them with the honest truth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest tragedy that I've witnessed in my career is vaccine-preventable death. There's nothing like it…and that's why I am so compelled. That's why I spend so much of my free time working on this. I have seen people die from vaccine preventable illness—people who refused to get the COVID vaccine in 2021 who died, who had kids or who had parents. That should never happen again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The team found the parasite interferes with essential communication between brain cells — research that can offer new ways to detect and treat chronic brain infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; can infect nearly any warm-blooded animal and prefers to live inside brain cells, forming cysts in neurons that can persist for life. The researchers report that they found infected neurons release fewer extracellular vesicles (EVs) — tiny, membrane-bound packets used by cells to exchange information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="align-left"&gt;


&lt;figcaption&gt;Emma Wilson&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found this disruption in EV signaling can interfere with how neurons and glial cells, especially astrocytes, maintain a healthy brain environment,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/emmaw"&gt;Emma H. Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of &lt;a href="https://biomed.ucr.edu/"&gt;biomedical sciences&lt;/a&gt; in the UC Riverside &lt;a href="https://medschool.ucr.edu/"&gt;School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; who led the research team. “Even a handful of infected neurons can shift the brain’s neurochemical balance. This suggests that communication between neurons and supporting glial cells is not only critical, but also vulnerable to hijacking by parasites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 10–30% of people in the United States are infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;, often without knowing it. The parasite is typically contracted through undercooked meat or exposure to cat feces. Although the immune system typically keeps the infection in check, the parasite can lie dormant in the brain for decades. In individuals with weakened immunity, it can reactivate and cause serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current diagnostic tools can only detect whether someone has been exposed to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; by identifying antibodies. The tools cannot confirm whether the parasite is still present in the brain or how it may be affecting brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our research opens the door to using EVs as biomarkers, which can be isolated from blood,” Wilson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted using mouse models and human cells in a laboratory setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilson explained that in healthy mouse brains astrocytes regulate neurotransmitters like glutamate, ensuring that neurons do not become overexcited. But when neurons infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; stop sending the right EV signals, this regulation breaks down. The result is elevated glutamate levels, which can lead to seizures, neural damage, or altered brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The parasite may play a larger role in neurological and behavioral conditions than we previously thought,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilson’s research team is now working to analyze samples from human blood banks to look for EVs linked to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; brain infection. The team also hopes to better understand how glial cells detect and respond to parasite proteins — insights that could one day lead to new therapies or even vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our brains have built-in defenses that may recognize and respond to neurons infected by &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;,” Wilson said. “If we can learn how to support or enhance that process, we may be able to better protect people, especially the most vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its potential impact, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; is often misunderstood, Wilson added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no need to avoid someone who is infected; most people live their entire lives without symptoms,” she said. “Pregnant individuals should be cautious as the parasite can cause serious birth defects if contracted for the first time during pregnancy. The most effective prevention is proper food handling and hygiene. Cook meat thoroughly, wash vegetables, and always wash your hands after handling cat litter, especially from young cats, which are more likely to shed the parasite.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilson was joined in the study by Emily Z. Tabaie, Ziting Gao, Nala Kachour, Arzu Ulu, Stacey Gomez, Zoe A. Figueroa, Kristina Bergersen, and Wenwan Zhong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was supported, in part, by funds from the UCR Division of Biomedical Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1012733"&gt;research paper&lt;/a&gt; is titled “&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; infection of neurons alters the production and content of extracellular vesicles directing astrocyte phenotype and contributing to the loss of GLT-1 in the infected brain.” &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Hold your horses, &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;. Scientists have created an experimental vaccine that could be effective against multiple types of fungal germs, including those that cause vaginal yeast infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Georgia developed the vaccine candidate, code-named NXT-2. In their latest study with mice, NXT-2 appeared to protect the animals from a common culprit of yeast infection, &lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt;. The team is now planning to forge ahead with human trials of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compared to bacteria or viruses, fungi don’t make people sick as often. But there are some common fungal illnesses that cause plenty of misery, including yeast infections and ringworm. Fungi can also cause serious, life-threatening infections in people with weakened immune systems or otherwise poor health. And fungal infections in general are becoming &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/deaths-fungal-infections-deadly-resistant-fungi-climate-1851169272"&gt;more common,&lt;/a&gt; possibly due to factors like climate change (fungi usually prefer temperatures cooler than our bodies, but some species have likely already become more tolerant to us).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another reason why fungi are becoming more dangerous is the lack of weapons available against them. We have far fewer antifungals than antibiotics, for instance, and no approved vaccines whatsoever. While new antifungals are needed, they’re ultimately a stopgap, since fungi can adapt and evolve resistance to them. So the UGA researchers are hoping that their “pan-fungal” vaccine can provide more of a long-term solution to the most worrying fungi out there.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In previous animal studies, the team’s NXT-2 vaccine &lt;a href="https://news.uga.edu/new-vaccine-targets-fungal-infections/"&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; effective at preventing or reducing harm from three of the most common sources of invasive fungal infections in people (collectively representing 80% of fatal infections). This latest research, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-025-01171-4"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in NPJ Vaccines, tested NXT-2 in a mouse model of vulvovaginal candidiasis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NXT-2 provoked a strong immune response in the mice to &lt;em&gt;C. albicans&lt;/em&gt; fungi, the researchers found, including in vaginal tissue. Vaccinated mice infected with the fungi also experienced reduced fungal burden and less vaginal tissue damage and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These studies provide supportive evidence of broad efficacy of NXT-2 and support the rationale for its further development as a single, pan-fungal vaccine for local and systemic fungal infections,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the vaccine may be able to tackle the most serious fungal infections, the researchers plan to first test it out in humans as a vaccine against recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). These infections &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(18)30103-8/abstract"&gt;affect&lt;/a&gt; over 100 million women worldwide every year and can be incredibly stressful, the researchers note. Young and otherwise healthy women also tend to experience these infections more often, which should make recruiting potential volunteers for trials easier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“RVVC is not life-threatening, but it is miserable. As many as one in 10 women develop the condition during their lifetime, suffering three or more yeast infections per year,” said lead author Karen Norris, a professor of immunology and translational biomedicine in the UGA College of Veterinary Medicine, in a &lt;a href="https://news.uga.edu/new-fungal-vaccine/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “This is a huge need.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Norris is also the CEO and founder of &lt;a href="https://nxtbiologics.com/"&gt;NXT Biologics&lt;/a&gt;, the biotech company developing NXT-2 commercially. And should NXT-2 succeed as hoped against yeast infections, the next step will be targeting the most dangerous fungi in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s where I believe this vaccine will do the most good: in people who are at high risk for highly dangerous, life-threatening infections,” Norris said.&lt;/p&gt;

They also scored high for psychological stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought that being overweight and stressed out triggers chronic inflammation and hormonal imbalances in the body, creating a perfect storm for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-3d08edf0-4c52-11f0-a7cd-f9ea195159ad" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study saw volunteers restricted to eating between 12 - 8 p.m. and practice a basic daily mindfulness routine involving breathwork and sitting quietly with closed eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In eight weeks, those who stuck to both habits lost an average of 4.2 lbs compared to just 0.2 lbs in the control group who made no lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, pictured, died of colon cancer earlier this year at age 26&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The former also saw improvements to their stress scores, insulin and glucose levels, as well as a drop in visceral fat mass - the most dangerous type of fat linked to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No significant changes were observed in the control group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the paper, the research team said: 'This study was feasible and well accepted by the participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Results were promising, indicating a potential synergy between time restricted eating and mindfulness for improving anthropometric, metabolic and colonic inflammation among young adults with obesity and moderate to severe perceived stress.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study of 42 participants also looked at the effects of following just one of the habits, finding less pronounced health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results were published in the journal Nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants who took part in mindfulness exercises followed the 'Mindfulness for Beginners' program in the Calm app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It involved a series of short, guided daily meditations about 10 minutes each, which involved simple, practical steps like focusing on breath, noticing thoughts and calming the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Carly Barrett (pictured right), from Kentucky, was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 24 after detecting blood in her stool and suffering from abdominal pain. She is still battling the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought that mindfulness reduces food cravings by changing how the brain responds to urges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When people practice mindfulness, they learn to observe cravings as passing sensations without immediately acting on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This weakens the link between feeling a craving and reaching for food or other substances such as alcohol or drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies using brain imaging show that mindfulness dampens activity in the brain’s reward and craving centers, such as the amygdala and striatum, while strengthening self-control regions like the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes amid an alarming rise in so-called early-onset colon cancers in people under the age of 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates among Americans in their 20s and 30s are expected to double by 2030 compared to 2010. In teens, cases have surged 500% since the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rising rates of obesity are thought to be a factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2000, the overall adult obesity rate was around 20% compared to around 40% now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors say that does not tell the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diets high in processed foods, which have been linked to inflammation, have also been suggested as a driver, as has rising stress levels in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other possible causes include the foodborne pathogen E. coli, gut changes linked to antibiotic use and changes to maternal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More mothers are now obese and older when they give birth, which may cause biological changes to their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's not just colon cancer that is rising in young people - rates of several types of cancer have been trending upwards in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14695689/colon-cancers-doctors-alarmed-rise-sharply-young-people.html"&gt;In a study published in May&lt;/a&gt;, researchers discovered 13 other cancers were found to be rising in under 50s: stomach,  pancreatic, bone and joint cancers, melanoma, breast, cervical, uterine, testicular, kidney and four types of cancers of the lymph system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc24679n001v3b77fy6dh9fh@published"&gt;She’s tried therapy, hypnosis, and every supplement on the market. She’s done sleep studies, she meditates, she does yoga, she takes medication, and has a frankly overwhelming exercise routine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="143" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc23qpdn00133b77rc74uln2@published"&gt;The problem is that if you’re dedicating three hours of your day outside work to exercise and meditation, there’s not always time for sex. If things get busy and I suggest cutting her lengthy workout short, she gets angry. But this is a busy work season for both of us, and we don’t get to be connected. She suggested I join her workouts instead, but that’s not sex. Destroying myself at the gym or psychotic distance runs is not my idea of fun or bonding. Last time I suggested cutting down on these solo projects to make time, she retaliated by suggesting she just wake me up at 3 a.m. for sex next time she’s awake all night and that it was “exactly the same.” How do we get a balance here? I feel like I’m coming in second to her sleep obsession.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="162" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc23qpig00163b771w6drf80@published"&gt;Your frustration is understandable, but so is your wife’s commitment to solving the life-upending problem that is insomnia. I’m not getting a lot of empathy from your letter. Have you ever gone through a period where you’re getting less sleep than you should? It impacts everything. It makes existence cumbersome. You can feel weighed down, lack clarity to make decisions or complete tasks (especially creative ones), and yes, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25772315/"&gt;it can impact one’s sex life&lt;/a&gt;. You’re approaching this from a zero-sum mindset: If your wife spends too much time attempting to manage her insomnia, she won’t have time for sex. But the thing is, if she has insomnia, she might not want sex at all. Getting over her insomnia, then, benefits both of you, and she should be allowed to pursue solutions with minimal interference. What is the alternative in your opinion? Do you want her to just accept her insomnia and live in misery? So that you can have sex more frequently?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc23qpjw00173b77vp9f867y@published"&gt;The first step to overcoming this issue would be for you to think about her more and yourself less. Adjust your regard for your wife, starting with the language you use to describe her behavior. Her distance runs are not “psychotic,” and if she has an “obsession” with sleep, it’s &lt;em&gt;because she’s lacking it&lt;/em&gt;. Sleep isn’t a luxury; it’s a necessity. The way you present the issue is with the same regard one might for someone who spends their days wrapped up in hobbies or aesthetic “self-care” like manicures and facials. She isn’t trying to work through insomnia because it’s fun, leisurely, or relaxing. Quite the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="162" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc23qpma00183b77upxhqj5s@published"&gt;Is it possible that she is being excessive in her plan to eradicate the insomnia? Of course. It may give her a sense of control where one is infuriatingly lacking. But, as you point out, she’s tried a bunch of stuff and so far, nothing’s worked. So, of course, she’s devoted to figuring this out. You want to be connected with her? Meet her where she is. Take her up on the fitness invitation. You don’t have to do every exercise she does, but spending more time together in the gym is a way that a lot of couples bond. It’s not sex, sure, but it’s better than being in two different places, not interacting. If she sees your effort, perhaps she’ll put more toward sex. Work with her. Right now, she’s wrestling with a burden, so do not add to it. Do all that you can to make her life easier. It’s what you should be doing as a partner, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="135" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmc23qpod00193b77r1ob7itx@published"&gt;Is waking you up for sex at 3 a.m. “exactly the same” as honoring your request to cut down on her endeavors to improve sleep? Not quite, but I think her point was that you’re asking her to bend to you while not giving anything in return. So try giving. It might not improve her sleep, and it might not get you laid more frequently, but at least if you do it and you don’t get results, you can point to that and ask her what else she thinks you can do together to improve your shared sex life. It will make your argument stronger when this comes up again. It will also help show that you &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not a quick-fix solution, but you’re married, so you’ve signed up to play the long game.&lt;/p&gt;

But science says it can—and the results are kind of wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s rewind to a 2019 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2724778#:~:text=Participants%20able%20to%20complete%20more,fewer%20than%2010%20push%2Dups." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in JAMA Network Open, which made some serious waves in the fitness and medical world. Researchers at Harvard University followed over 1,100 male firefighters for 10 years to see whether a person’s ability to perform push-ups had anything to do with their risk of heart disease. And surprise—it did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the punchline: Men who could do 40 or more push-ups had a 96% lower risk of cardiovascular events (like heart attacks or heart failure) compared to those who could do fewer than 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yep, you read that right. Forty push-ups may just be your free, no-equipment-required ticket to checking up on your ticker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, what’s the connection?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, push-ups aren’t just about chest strength. They require upper body, core, and even lower body engagement. If you can do a decent number of push-ups with good form, you likely have decent muscular endurance, healthy weight, and decent cardiovascular fitness. All of these are known to be protective factors against heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms: Push-ups are a fast and dirty way to measure your overall physical health, which tends to go hand-in-hand with heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Justin Yang, the study’s lead author and occupational medicine specialist at Harvard, push-up capacity was a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than even traditional treadmill tests in their research group. Wild, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;But don’t panic if you can’t do 40 (yet)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look—we’re not saying that doing fewer than 40 push-ups means you’re doomed. That would be dramatic (and wrong). What the research suggests is a correlation, not a cause-and-effect situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It simply means that if you have the endurance and muscle strength to crank out 40 push-ups, your heart is likely in pretty good shape. If not, it’s just a nudge—a clue that maybe it’s time to build up your strength, improve your fitness, and pay a little more attention to your overall health habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Push-ups aren’t a replacement for blood tests, blood pressure monitoring, or a proper check-up. But hey, if you're looking for a quick self-test at home, this is a pretty solid place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why push-ups work as a fitness marker&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what makes push-ups unique:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re compound movements, which means multiple joints and muscle groups are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They test both strength and endurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They require core control and body awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t fake them. No shortcuts, no fancy machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, they’re often used in military and law enforcement fitness assessments for a reason—they're accessible, fast, and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And unlike running a mile or climbing stairs, push-ups aren’t heavily affected by joint issues or weather. You can do them on your bedroom floor at 6 a.m. or at the gym after work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The silent warning&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease often doesn’t show early symptoms. Many people walk around with high blood pressure, clogged arteries, or early heart damage without having a clue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what makes functional tests like the push-up challenge interesting—they may act as an early warning system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re struggling to get to 10 push-ups without your arms shaking like jelly, it doesn’t mean you’re unhealthy—it just means it’s time to get curious and check in. Maybe your blood pressure’s a little high. Maybe your weight crept up over the years. Maybe your lifestyle needs a little reset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is power, and a couple of push-ups might just give you the spark to investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start where you are—and build up&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're nowhere near 40 push-ups, that’s totally fine. Fitness isn’t about perfection—it’s about progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick ladder to get stronger:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start with incline push-ups (hands on a bench or wall).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move to knee push-ups as you build strength.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then work up to full push-ups, even if it's just one or two a day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim to add a few reps each week. You’d be amazed at how fast the body adapts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mix in cardio, stretch regularly, and clean up your diet—and suddenly your heart’s got a lot more support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Push-ups don’t require a gym. They don’t need a fancy outfit. They don’t even demand much time. But according to research, they might give you more insight into your heart than you’d expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The content in this article is intended for informational and educational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings do not prove screen use was the cause of mental health problems. But they highlight that compulsive use, which appears to be very common, as a significant risk factor that parents and healthcare services should be alert to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Yunyu Xiao, an assistant professor of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine and first author of the study, said: “For parents and educators, the discussion around mobile phones and social media has focused on limiting or banning use, but our results indicate more complex factors are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Testing interventions that work against other types of addiction may be one way to approach this type of social media and mobile phone use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings come amid &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/05/does-the-uk-have-a-mental-health-overdiagnosis-problem-welfare-wes-streeting" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;escalating mental health problems in young people&lt;/a&gt; and as governments are grappling with how to enforce safeguards around smartphones and social media. Against this backdrop, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01141-9" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;scientists have faced a near-impossible challenge&lt;/a&gt; to try to pin down evidence of how rapidly evolving and highly personalised screen use might be linked to young people’s mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The latest study tracked almost 4,300 adolescents aged nine to 10 when they started the study. Rather than simply measuring screen time, the scientists assessed participants for “addictive use”, such as whether technology was interfering with activities like schoolwork and exercise and whether people experienced craving or feelings of distress when screens were withdrawn. Machine learning was used to cluster participants into groups based on their screen use trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For mobile phones, about half of the children reported high addictive use from the start of the study that remained high through early adolescence, and a quarter developed increasing addictive use as they aged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For social media, 41% of children had high or increasing addictive use. For social media and mobile phones, the high and increasing addictive use trajectories were associated with a two to three times greater risk of suicidal behaviours and suicidal ideation compared with the low addictive use trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More than 40% of the youths had a high addictive use trajectory for video games. These adolescents were significantly more likely to report suicidal thoughts or behaviours, as well as symptoms of anxiety, depression, aggression or rule-breaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;By contrast, the total amount of time spent on social media, mobile phones and video games was not associated with future suicide-related or mental health outcomes. What mattered most was whether their use showed signs of compulsion, distress or loss of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Xiao said: “There are many factors that would induce addictive feelings, such as the designs of the social media or video games, some kids may also experience bullying and more adverse childhood that they find using phones more comfortable, but later they cannot stop using it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.7829?guestAccessKey=1e247dd1-cadf-430c-baad-bc5c5543ad29&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=061825" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the journal Jama&lt;/a&gt;, raise further questions over how parents should manage children’s screen use. “We do not know if just taking away access will help, unless it is taking away access 24/7, because we know from studies of addiction management that partial access can quickly reinforce the addiction,” Xiao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Amy Orben, who leads the Digital Mental &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Group at the University of Cambridge, said the study could not prove that technology use caused mental health problems.

Researchers analyzed data from over 500,000 individuals and found that higher-risk participants reported lower social isolation and more positive family interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While emotional support and loneliness levels remained unchanged, these individuals took part in more social activities. This could reflect early compensatory behavior or increased attention from others noticing subtle cognitive changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher genetic Alzheimer’s risk was associated with &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; reported isolation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive Engagement:&lt;/strong&gt; At-risk individuals reported better family relationships and more social participation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Reserve Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Social connectedness may help buffer the brain against dementia-related decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many experts believe that social isolation is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a new study, led by UC San Francisco and Boston University, examined the social habits and genetic data of half a million Britons whose average age was 56, and found that the disease may make them more sociable rather than less – at least in the early stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111000"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a group of people." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/social-behavior-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study shows that at its earliest stage Alzheimer’s doesn’t make people less socially engaged. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What They Discovered &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data from UK Biobank showed that people with a higher genetic risk for Alzheimer’s reported less isolation, participation in a wider range of social activities and happier family relationships.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No differences were found between higher-risk and lower-risk individuals in measuring loneliness, friendship quality and emotional support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why It Matters &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows that at its earliest stage Alzheimer’s doesn’t make people less socially engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their social lives may even expand,” said co-senior author Kotwal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know for sure if they are engaging more with others, or if those around them are noticing subtle changes and giving them more support.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need to Know &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social connectedness is believed to delay or reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s by promoting cognitive reserve, the brain’s ability to maintain normal function despite aging or dementia. UCSF research has shown that other non-genetic factors influencing Alzheimer’s are physical inactivity, uncontrolled diabetes and high blood pressure, poor sleep, depression, current smoking and certain medications. Experts believe that 30% of Alzheimer’s may be attributed to these modifiable risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding&lt;/strong&gt;: National Institutes of Health (P01 AG082653-01A1) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0556707f646b6b602b49606c626d45706676632b606170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Suzanne Leigh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucsf.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Suzanne Leigh – UCSF&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaf122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Association of Alzheimer’s Disease Genetic Risk with Social Connectedness in Middle- And Older-Ages&lt;/a&gt;” by Ashwin Kotwal et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Association of Alzheimer’s Disease Genetic Risk with Social Connectedness in Middle- And Older-Ages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational evidence suggests that social connectedness protects against Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), but reverse causality has not been ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated the potential for a reverse path by estimating associations between AD genetic risk score (AD-GRS) and social connectedness across mid and late-life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used data from 487,194 UK Biobank participants aged 40+ years and considered social connectedness measures capturing social isolation, loneliness, relationship satisfaction, emotional support, and diverse social activity participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants’ mean age was 56.5 (SD: 8.2) years. Higher AD-GRS was associated with a lower social isolation score (&lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01; 95% CI: -0.014 to -0.001); these associations strengthened with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher AD-GRS was associated with higher levels of family relationship satisfaction (&lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01; 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.01), but this association was attenuated with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher AD-GRS was associated with engaging in a wider variety of social activities (&lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.004 to 0.03), with no evidence of heterogeneity by age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations with loneliness, friendship relationship quality, and perceived emotional support were null.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, we did not find evidence that higher risk of AD is associated with reduced social connectedness. Instead, preclinical AD symptoms may lead to stronger family relationships and lower social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 14:59:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFA0LUdaOHFyR0p2bXpKdGs5UjVjdFFXTWViVE4yTjBvaEFZd2xlbnRfWlJMS0J5cklza1ZMWkE5STVDOW5XLWlObmtYM3dRbUhyNF9ORTh0b01rZ3FERk50RjBFbUhDR2g2dzB2OHQ2QQ</guid></item><item><title>记忆和习惯如何影响心理健康结果-神经科学新闻 | How Memory and Habits Shape Mental Health Outcomes - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE5WRk5QOTVCdDVFbFRfWUxvU183LVVJV2tNWE0ydFl0ZXFiR2ZwV19iYmpoN2Jpd1JuYjFRd3hpZ3ZGRjJRSVE1WXZGWGdqdU9NckY5cnlDTXFhUFE0c2xseG5ndEZxeVhtSmVLYXk0bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Despite being rooted in science, evidence-based psychological treatments often fail to deliver lasting results because people forget much of what they learn and struggle to build new habits. A new study highlights the disconnect between what patients remember from therapy sessions and what they implement in real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people retain only about 30% of clinical information, and habit formation can take months without the right support. By integrating simple tools like timely reminders and behavior cues, researchers believe treatments can be more effective and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Retention Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Patients recall only ~30% of what’s shared in therapy sessions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow Habit Formation:&lt;/strong&gt; New behaviors can take 18 days to 36 weeks to become routine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple Fixes:&lt;/strong&gt; Tools like text reminders can significantly improve patient follow-through.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison Harvey knew she’d have to study hard when she enrolled in an 11-week course on parenting techniques earlier this year. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A UC Berkeley professor of psychology who researches memory, habits and sleep, Harvey printed her notes and meticulously completed each week’s homework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She engaged with the instructors, who were also well-respected clinical psychologists. And she was far more engaged than her classmates, including her husband. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, when the class ended, Harvey was confronted with a familiar reality: Despite studying hard, she’d forgotten many of the lessons she was supposed to have learned and put into practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was far short of where you’d want a patient to be at the end of 11 sessions,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frustrating as it was, Harvey said her experience was a personal window into the shortcomings of what are called evidence-based psychological treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These treatments, which include various forms of counseling, trauma interventions and cognitive behavioral therapy, are rooted in science and used widely to treat an array of mental health challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Harvey describes in a recent paper in the journal &lt;em&gt;Behaviour Research and Therapy&lt;/em&gt;, these treatments often fall short because of humans’ flawed memories and difficulties creating new, healthier habits. Her research explores how subtle treatment changes could significantly improve patient outcomes — both mentally and physically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory gaps in health care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, change requires acknowledging the profound gap between what’s discussed in a clinical setting and what people actually remember after they leave. Doctors may have said the right thing, but there’s often a lack of follow-up to ensure the patient retains the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People also have notoriously terrible memories, Harvey said, pointing to research showing patients only retain about 30% of information shared in a session. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think us humans realize how fallible our memories are,” Harvey said. “We’ve got decades of psychological research showing that we fail to encode memories accurately. We fail to store them accurately. And we fail to retrieve them accurately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That memory gap can undermine even the best-laid treatment plans. If a patient forgets the majority of what was discussed, they’re less likely to see positive, lasting benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habits take time — and effort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory is only part of the puzzle. Additionally, Harvey said, we must confront how difficult it is to build new behaviors into routines — a process that social and health psychologists say can take between 18 days and 36 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are science-backed strategies to help, like pairing new actions with existing routines or activities. But without explicit discussion in clinical settings about how to make new skills habitual, patients may struggle to maintain progress after treatment ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Harvey said, existing treatments too often lead patients to forget what they’re supposed to do, and those who know what they should do often fail to regularly do it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve got a mental health crisis. We’ve got treatments that work. But those treatments need to be improved to get people much better,” she said. “That, I think, is a real scientific challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ongoing sleep research seeking solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding ways to address the memory and habit formation elements of health interventions doesn’t need to be overly complicated. Sometimes it’s as simple as a carefully worded text message. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvey’s ongoing sleep research, backed by the National Institutes of Health, focuses on memory and habit change that can lead to better sleep. In one study, her team sends participants text messages with cues, reminders and follow-ups to understand what drives habit change and, ultimately, better health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At 10 p.m. I will dim the lights and put my phone down,” said one automated message, setting the goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A morning message asks if the goals were met. If so, participants were rewarded with a fun fact: “Did you know dolphins and whales sleep with only half of their brain at a time so they can still swim during sleep?” If not, they were encouraged to try again the next night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early results are encouraging, she said, adding that it would be important to also study how similar interventions could scale into mental and physical health settings.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can come up with augmentations that could be applied before a session, in the middle of a session or at the end of a session that are not costly,” Harvey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They don’t have side effects, but they’re effective at improving outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind those improvements is a commitment to basic science, she said. Her work on memory is based on cognitive science and education research, and habit formation is deeply tied to social psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaking down research silos, like she’s attempting to do with sleep research, is a pathway toward improving patient outcomes more broadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unless we’re paying attention to and adhering to what’s being found in those other fields, we just won’t be effective or as effective,” she said. “It’s like a pipeline of science at every step.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the parenting class she took, Harvey said there were valuable lessons. But many of them faded from memory and never became second nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s sort of funny though, isn’t it? Despite all that studiousness, only a few months later, I’m struggling to recall. This, I guess, is the whole point.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#305a405f585c705255425b555c55491e555445" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jason Pohl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jason Pohl – UC Berkeley&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2025.104767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Maximizing benefits from evidence-based psychological treatments: Memory support and habit formation as key strategies&lt;/a&gt;” by Allison Harvey et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behaviour Research and Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximizing benefits from evidence-based psychological treatments: Memory support and habit formation as key strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence-based psychological treatments (EBPTs) aim to reverse psychological processes that contribute to the development and/or maintenance of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed and rigorously tested through scientific research, EBPTs effectively address a broad range of mental health challenges, often as front-line treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is potential to further improve outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper examines two strategies for maximizing the benefits of EBPTs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first addresses the concerning and well replicated finding that patients accurately recall only about one-third of the treatment points discussed during a session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This poor memory for treatment negatively impacts adherence to the EBPT and outcomes from the EBPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of developing and testing the Memory Support Intervention (MSI), to improve patient memory for treatment, is described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latter involved leveraging findings from cognitive psychology and education to develop memory support strategies to add to EBPTs, with the goal of improving EBPT outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second strategy for maximizing the benefits of EBPTs highlights the potential of habit formation principles to enhance EBPTs. While a core goal of EBPTs is to reduce unhelpful habits and encourage adaptive ones, the science of habit formation has not been fully integrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Habit-based Intervention (HABITs) was developed to explicitly incorporate habit formation elements into EBPTs. Both the MSI and HABITs are designed as adjunctive interventions, enhancing EBPTs without increasing the number or duration of sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of leveraging insights from diverse fields of basic science to uncover new strategies for improving both the short- and long-term outcomes of EBPTs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 14:31:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5WRk5QOTVCdDVFbFRfWUxvU183LVVJV2tNWE0ydFl0ZXFiR2ZwV19iYmpoN2Jpd1JuYjFRd3hpZ3ZGRjJRSVE1WXZGWGdqdU9NckY5cnlDTXFhUFE0c2xseG5ndEZxeVhtSmVLYXk0bw</guid></item><item><title>您手机的自拍相机现在可以检测抑郁症。操作方法- NDTV | Your Phone's Selfie Camera Can Now Detect Depression.

                                        &lt;p&gt;A new technology is emerging that utilises the front-facing camera on devices to analyse emotions and monitor mental health. An app called Emobot is already being used by hundreds of patients to track their mood and assess the effectiveness of their depression treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app analyses facial expressions throughout the day and generates a report, similar to a step count or heart rate graph.

                                        &lt;p&gt;A new technology is emerging that utilises the front-facing camera on devices to analyse emotions and monitor mental health. An app called Emobot is already being used by hundreds of patients to track their mood and assess the effectiveness of their depression treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app analyses facial expressions throughout the day and generates a report, similar to a step count or heart rate graph. According to co-founder Samuel Lerman, Emobot is classified as a medical device in France, and the company is collaborating with psychiatrists to prescribe it to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/06/17/now-phone-can-tell-depression-using-selfie-camera-23428483/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Metro,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the team was initially afraid people would find this too intrusive, given the app constantly watches you, and a future version will even listen to your tone of voice as you go about your day via the phone microphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Lerman said, "The camera is open in the background all the time."

"Nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels, supports healthy blood pressure, improves circulation and protects against arterial stiffness." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-to-never-do-when-you-first-wake-up-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The One Thing You Should Never, Ever Do Within the First Hour of Waking Up, According to Cardiologists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The One Thing You Should Never, Ever Do Within the First Hour of Waking Up, According to Cardiologists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As we age, our ability to make nitric oxide declines; so supporting this production through diet is one of the easiest and most effective ways to maintain cardiovascular function and longevity, according to Dr. Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Another Helpful Addition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from leafy greens, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaynemorgan" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Jayne Morgan, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Jayne Morgan, MD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;cardiologist and vice president of medical affairs for &lt;a href="https://www.helloheart.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hello Heart, recommends adding fiber, especially soluble fiber,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Hello Heart, recommends adding fiber, especially soluble fiber,&lt;/a&gt;

whether that's bacon, sausage, hot dogs or even deli meats. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"These meats are &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-not-to-do-after-eating-salty-meal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high in sodium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high in sodium&lt;/a&gt; (salt), saturated fats, and preservatives (nitrates/nitrites) and are linked to increases in blood pressure, cholesterol, and chronic inflammation in the body," Dr. Morgan says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aside from hot dogs, you may also want to think twice when you go to grab your next sweet treat.

That's partly because Alzheimer's disease has multiple causes – many of which are &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-024-01911-3"&gt;still not fully understood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two proteins which are widely believed to play central roles in Alzheimer's disease are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24493463/"&gt;amyloid-beta and tau&lt;/a&gt;. Amyloid-beta forms sticky plaques on the outside of brain cells. This disrupts communication between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tau accumulate inside brain cells, where it twists into tangles. This ultimately leads to cell death. These plaques and tangles are the hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This understanding, known as the &lt;a href="https://ajp.amjpathol.org/article/S0002-9440(24)00407-3/fulltext"&gt;amyloid hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, has shaped research for decades and led to treatments that aim to clear amyloid from the brain. &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)01077-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867423010772%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Monoclonal antibody drugs&lt;/a&gt; have been approved in recent years for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they only work in the early stages of the disease. They do not reverse existing damage and may cause serious side-effects such as brain swelling and bleeding. Most importantly, they only target amyloid-beta, leaving tau untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a surprise twist, recent research published by my colleagues and me has found that a protein from &lt;em&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/em&gt; – a bacteria best known for causing stomach ulcers – can block the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.ads7525"&gt;toxic buildup of both amyloid-beta and tau&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unexpected finding may point to a new strategy for the fight against Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Illustration of yellow clumps on pink nerve cells" class="size-full wp-image-143082" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of yellow amyloid-beta plaques on neurons. (Science Photo Library/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our discovery began with a very different question. We were initially studying how &lt;em&gt;H pylori&lt;/em&gt; interacts with other microbes. Some bacteria form &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2461721"&gt;protective communities called biofilms&lt;/a&gt;, which rely on amyloid assemblies (similar in structure to the plaques which form in the brain) as a structural scaffold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led us to wonder: could &lt;em&gt;H pylori&lt;/em&gt; influence bacterial biofilms by also interfering with amyloid assemblies in humans?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We turned our attention to a well-known &lt;em&gt;H pylori&lt;/em&gt; protein called CagA. While half of the protein is known to trigger harmful effects in human cells (referred to as the C-terminal region), the other half (the protein's N-terminal region) may have protective properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To our surprise, this N-terminal fragment, called CagAN, dramatically reduced the formation of both bacterial amyloids and biofilms in the bacterial species &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouraged by these results, we tested whether the same protein fragment could block the buildup of human amyloid-beta proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, we incubated amyloid-beta molecules in the lab: some were treated with CagAN, while others were left as normal. We then tracked amyloid formation using a fluorescence reader and an electron microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that treated samples had far less amyloid clump formation during the testing period. Even at very low concentrations, CagAN almost completely stopped amyloid-beta from forming amyloid aggregates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how CagAN worked, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (which allows us to look at how molecules interact with each other) to examine how the protein interacts with amyloid-beta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also used computer modelling to investigate possible mechanisms. Remarkably, CagAN also blocked tau aggregation – suggesting it acts on multiple toxic proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Blocking the disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study has shown us that a fragment from the &lt;em&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/em&gt; protein can effectively block the buildup of the two proteins that are implicated in Alzheimer's disease. This suggests that bacterial proteins – or drugs modelled after them – could someday block the earliest signs of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the benefits may extend beyond Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In additional experiments, the same bacterial fragment blocked the aggregation of &lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adbi.202101301"&gt;IAPP&lt;/a&gt; (a protein involved in type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="165051" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-023-05672-9"&gt;alpha-synuclein&lt;/a&gt; (linked to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="165051" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease). All of these conditions are driven by the accumulation of toxic amyloid aggregates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That a single bacterial fragment could interfere with so many proteins suggests exciting therapeutic potential. Though these conditions affect different parts of the body, they may be linked through cross-talk between amyloid proteins – a shared mechanism that CagAN could help disrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's important to be clear: this research is still at an early stage. All of our experiments were conducted in lab settings, not yet in animals or humans. Still, the findings open a new path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study also uncovered the underlying mechanisms for how CagAN blocked the amyloid-beta and tau from forming amyloid aggregates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the ways in which CagAN did this was by preventing the proteins from coming together to form clumps. They also prevented small, premature amyloid aggregates from forming as well. In the future, we will continue the detailed mechanism study and evaluate the effects in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results also prompt a question: could &lt;em&gt;H pylori&lt;/em&gt;, long seen only as harmful, also have a protective side? Some studies have hinted at a connection between &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hel.12454"&gt;&lt;em&gt;H pylori&lt;/em&gt; infection and Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, though the relationship remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our discovery adds a new layer to this discussion, suggesting that part of &lt;em&gt;H pylori&lt;/em&gt; may actually interfere with the molecular events that lead to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means in the future, we may need to take a more precise and personalised approach. Instead of aiming to eliminate &lt;em&gt;H pylori&lt;/em&gt; completely with antibiotics, it might be more important to understand, in different biological contexts, which parts of the bacterium are harmful, and which might actually be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As medicine continues to move toward greater precision, the goal may no longer be to wipe out every microbe, but to understand how some of them might work with us rather than against us.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259018/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;
