class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to experts writing in the Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology, &amp;amp; Women’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, this lack of documentation has resulted in a relatively basic understanding of the impact of menstrual cycles on health, as well as the underdiagnosis and neglect of concerns related to menstruation such as pain and heavy bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These menstrual cycle characteristics can be indicators for conditions such as diabetes, thyroid disorders, polycystic ovarian syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/england" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, information on a patient’s menstrual cycle is not routinely collected by healthcare professionals, unlike other measures such as BMI, blood pressure and cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More than a quarter of women in England are living with a serious reproductive health issue, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/10/one-in-four-women-england-reproductive-health-issue-survey" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;largest survey of its kind&lt;/a&gt; published this year, with experts saying that “systemic, operational, structural and cultural issues” prevent women from accessing care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Almost a fifth (19%) of women who took part in the study experienced severe period pain in the last year, and 40% of respondents reported heavy menstrual bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/11/medical-misogyny-condemns-women-to-years-of-gynaecological-pain-mps-told" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;report by the women and equalities parliamentary committee&lt;/a&gt; last year found that women and girls are enduring years of pain because their reproductive conditions are being dismissed due to “medical misogyny”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Ranee Thakar, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “Serious conditions like fibroids and endometriosis can have a devastating impact on almost every aspect of a person’s life, including impacting their physical and mental health, and their ability to work and socialise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Too often systemic, operational, structural and cultural issues mean women do not get the care they deserve and our current system risks entrenching the health inequalities we can see in these findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="01c5c490-0a9b-4a0c-affc-2f04a8bf9758" data-spacefinder-role="richLink"

              &lt;p&gt;A 55-year-old man’s swollen toes and fingers turned out to have a much stranger explanation than expected. In a recent case report, the man’s doctors detailed how some of his bones were “completely replaced” by metastatic tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors in Australia &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/image-challenge?ci=20250710"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; the case earlier this month in the New England Journal of Medicine. The man visited the hospital after weeks of having pain and swelling in one finger and one toe. They soon discovered the symptoms were an unusual complication of the man’s earlier diagnosed metastatic squamous-cell lung cancer. Tragically, he soon died after.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The man, as it turned out, had acrometastases—or cancers that had spread beyond his lungs to the bones past his elbows and knees. Acrometastases are incredibly rare, only &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8471162/"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to occur in 0.1% of cases where cancer spreads to the bones. Though they’re sometimes the first sign of a hidden late-stage cancer, they’re more often preceded by other noticeable symptoms, as in this case. The condition is typically caused by cancers of the lung, gastrointestinal tract, and urinary tract; it’s also more common in men.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the man had experienced six weeks of painful swelling in his right middle finger and right big toe, along with an open wound under the toe’s fingernail. The swollen appendages were also firm and tender to touch. Acrometastases can superficially resemble gout or osteomyelitis, the report authors noted. But X-rays easily revealed the cause behind the man’s symptoms: cancerous lesions that had “completely replaced” the outermost bones of his finger and toe.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Images of the man’s finger and toe can be seen &lt;a href="https://x.com/NEJM/status/1945861135263244710"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in an X post from the NEJM, and also embedded below.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because acrometastases are usually the result of highly advanced cancer, people’s odds of survival once they develop it are already low. People are typically expected to live less than six months after diagnosis. In this case, the doctors opted to treat the patient with palliative radiotherapy, which is intended to alleviate the symptoms of cancer rather than to eradicate it. The man died about three weeks later from &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572109/"&gt;refractory hypercalcemia&lt;/a&gt;, or dangerously high levels of calcium in the blood that don’t respond to standard treatment. This condition is often a complication of cancer as well.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s bad news for carboholics. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research suggests that eating bread, pasta and other grain products may trigger or worsen a wide range of psychological symptoms, including depression, anxiety and even schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that some people could be especially at risk, with these mealtime staples quietly sabotaging their brains every time they take a bite. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A protein widely found in bread, pasta and other grains could be why some people are depressed or anxious.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key culprit, researchers theorize, is gluten.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This naturally occurring protein — found in wheat, barley and rye — acts as a binder that gives baked goods and other foods their structure and chew.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For most, it’s harmless. But in others, gluten sensitivity can trigger a range of unpleasant symptoms, including bloating, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, headaches and joint pain, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21622-gluten-intolerance" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;In more serious cases, it can develop into celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder in which the body mistakes gluten for a harmful invader, like a virus. The resulting immune response triggers inflammation and damage in the small intestine — but the effects may go far beyond digestion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Inflammation that starts in the gut doesn’t stay in the gut. [It] can have a damaging effect on the brain,” Dr. Emeran Mayer, a gastroenterologist and neuroscientist, told &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/risking-it/202306/it-wasnt-adhd-or-anxiety-it-was-gluten"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When immune cells are activated, the vagus nerve system sends a signal to the brain that can trigger fatigue and depression-like behavior,” he noted. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Most traditional bread products contain gluten.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;bukhta79 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In children, that can look like irritability or symptoms of ADHD. In adults, it may show up as brain fog, mood disorders or more serious psychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take depression, for example. While around &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;8% of the general population&lt;/a&gt; is diagnosed with major depressive disorder at some point in their lives, studies suggest that people with celiac disease are hit much harder — with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4763959/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;some research putting the rate as high as 30%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Celiac disease has also been linked to a greater risk of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11633532/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3641836/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;panic disorder&lt;/a&gt; and even schizophrenia. In fact, &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2004/celiac-schizophrenia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found that people with celiac are three times more likely to develop schizophrenia than those without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond inflammation, research suggests that damage to the gut lining caused by gluten sensitivity may also contribute to these mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That damage can &lt;a href="https://thejemfoundation.com/gluten-and-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;interfere with the absorption of nutrients&lt;/a&gt; essential for brain function, including B vitamins, iron, vitamin D, magnesium and zinc. Deficiencies in any of these can lead to a variety of psychological symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Some studies suggest a potential link between celiac disease and an increased risk of developing schizophrenia. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;andriano_cz – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Scientists have also found that people with schizophrenia often &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4476307/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;test positive for high levels of antibodies linked to gluten sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, hinting at a possible connection between the two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These antibodies can cross the placenta, and &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/maternal-gluten-sensitivity-linked-to-schizophrenia-risk-in-children" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that mothers with elevated levels may increase the risk of psychosis in their children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know everything. But it’s another step closer connecting the dots about these illnesses,” Deanna L. Kelly, a psychiatry professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who has spent the past 15 years leading clinical trials in schizophrenia and severe mental illness, told &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/the-professor-who-believes-eating-bread-could-be-making-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can a gluten-free diet help?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research is mixed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nutrition-research-reviews/article/progression-of-coeliac-disease-its-neurological-and-psychiatric-implications/0FEE9E54B80338FD7A7E3637FCA085E9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Some studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that a gluten-free diet can ease anxiety, depression and neurological complications in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Some people with gluten sensitivity experience mood changes, including depression. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;SHOTPRIME STUDIO – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18622804/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one trial&lt;/a&gt;, participants with celiac reported lower anxiety levels after following a gluten-free diet for a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But others show no significant improvement — and in some cases, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20533598/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;anxiety levels remained elevated&lt;/a&gt; even after cutting gluten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some experts think part of the problem may come from the psychological stress of managing a chronic health condition.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“Being on a gluten-free diet can also lead to some of these psychiatric or mental health issues, because you have to be somewhat hyper-vigilant,” Debra Silberg, a gastroenterologist and chief science officer at Beyond Celiac, told &lt;a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/mental-health-issues-and-celiac-disease-are-linked-a-gluten-free-diet-can"&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s also a fear of going out and becoming exposed to gluten,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across the country, about 1 in every 133 people — roughly 1% of the US population — is estimated to have celiac disease, according to &lt;a href="https://www.beyondceliac.org/celiac-disease/facts-and-figures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Beyond Celiac&lt;/a&gt;. That adds up to around 2 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe the number of people affected by gluten intolerance is much higher. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5677194/#:~:text=Currently%2C%201%25%20of%20the%20United,of%20the%20United%20States%20public." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Studies estimate&lt;/a&gt; that about 6% of the US population — or roughly 20 million people — may be sensitive to gluten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="publichealthresponse" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Public Health Response"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Public Health Response&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 24, PHMDC posted a food and symptom history questionnaire on its website. The link was distributed widely through a press release and on social media. All persons who experienced symptoms after eating food from the restaurant during October 22–24 were asked to complete the questionnaire. Respondents were asked to provide the names of other persons who had eaten food from the restaurant and become ill. The hospital provided PHMDC with the names of nine patients who sought care during October 23–24 after eating at the restaurant. On October 25, PHMDC contacted persons on this list who had not completed a questionnaire and asked them to complete the questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During October 24–30, PHMDC received 208 responses; 101 were excluded from analysis because they contained 1) mostly incomplete information, 2) the name of a fictional character, 3) names or addresses that included marijuana or THC-related words, or 4) information that indicated the person did not actually eat food from the restaurant. The remaining 107 responses were considered valid (&lt;a id="F2_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#F2_down"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt;). An outbreak-associated case of THC intoxication was defined as at least one of the following signs or symptoms (&lt;a id="T1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T1_down"&gt;Table&lt;/a&gt;): dizziness, sleepiness, anxiety, short term memory impact or time distortion, increased heart rate, nausea, paranoia, panic attack, increased blood pressure, vomiting, or hallucinations in a person who ate pizza, garlic bread, cheese bread, or a grinder (submarine sandwich) purchased from the restaurant during October 22–24, with symptom onset within 5 hours of eating the restaurant’s food. Eighty-five persons met the case definition for THC intoxication. Median time from eating food to symptom onset was 1 hour (range = 0–4 hours). Forty-seven persons meeting the case definition were male, and 38 were female; median age was 43 years (range = 1–91 years). Thirty-three persons consulted a health care provider (28 in a hospital ED and five elsewhere), and three were hospitalized for at least 1 night. Based on self-reporting in the questionnaire comments and information from the hospital, 15 persons received a positive test result for THC (&lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/182880#tabs-3"&gt;Supplementary Figure&lt;/a&gt;). Information about whether THC testing was performed was not available from the other 70 respondents. Eight persons (9%) were children and adolescents aged &amp;lt;18 years, none of whom was hospitalized. Dizziness was the only symptom reported for the youngest child (aged 1 year) with “not sure” indicated for all other symptoms in the questionnaire. Four children, aged &amp;lt;13 years (range = 3–8 years), had symptoms of dizziness (four), nausea (four), sleepiness (four), vomiting (three), anxiety (two), paranoia (one), short-term memory impact or time distortion (one), hallucinations (one), head or neck pain (one), and a heavy head (one). Respondents were asked to provide the names of other persons who ate food from the restaurant and became ill; eight additional persons who became ill after eating at the restaurant were identified, but none completed a questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 24, PHMDC issued a press release alerting the public via social media not to eat leftover pizza purchased from the restaurant during October 22–24. This information was updated on October 28 to include leftover grinders, garlic bread, and cheese bread. The updated information was shared with the public via social media and PHMDC’s blog, which is posted to the PHMDC website and emailed to approximately 3,000 subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

The retired wrestling icon reportedly died following a cardiac arrest incident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been many high-profile stories of cardiac arrest in recent years. In July 2023, basketball player Bronny James &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lebron-james-bronny-cardiac-arrest_n_64bfdca6e4b0dcb4caba63bb" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="suffered a cardiac arrest" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="64bfdca6e4b0dcb4caba63bb" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;suffered a cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt; during a USC practice session. Earlier that year in January, Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin collapsed on the field during an NFL game against the Cincinnati Bengals with the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiac arrest is a terrifying event no person ― or family ― ever wants to experience. The recent news stories of cardiac arrests among athletes have certainly put a spotlight on this type of medical emergency and the potentially lifesaving steps bystanders can take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Retired wrestler Hulk Hogan died on July 24. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is Cardiac Arrest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiac arrest is when your heart stops completely and is no longer pumping blood to your vital organs, like the brain, liver and kidneys,” Dr. Comilla Sasson, the vice president for science and innovation for emergency cardiovascular care at the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="American Heart Association" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.heart.org/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;, told HuffPost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiac arrest can stem from a known heart condition or occur suddenly and unexpectedly. The most common cause is ventricular fibrillation ― a type of arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat. It’s an electrical disturbance that prevents the heart from doing its job properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s been some speculation that what happened to Damar Hamlin was something called commotio cordis,” Sasson said. “Something hits you in the chest ― blunt chest trauma ― and does it at the exact time your heart is contracting. That sets your heart into an irregular rhythm, ventricular fibrillation, so your heart can no longer pump like it should, leading to cardiac arrest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commotio cordis was first described &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/circep.111.962712" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="in the context of 18th-century laborers" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/circep.111.962712" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;in the context of 18th-century laborers&lt;/a&gt;, but more recently this sort of blunt trauma event has tended to occur in sports like baseball, hockey, lacrosse and football. Although several medical experts have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BAshbyMD/status/1610110420584472578" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="pointed to commotio cordis" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://twitter.com/BAshbyMD/status/1610110420584472578" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;pointed to commotio cordis&lt;/a&gt; as a potential explanation for Hamlin’s cardiac arrest, they’ve also emphasized that the public is not privy to the personal medical information necessary to identify a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Genetic conditions can make your heart have an irregular heart rhythm,” Sasson said. “&lt;span&gt;Athletes can also be prone to something called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,” she added, describing it as a thickening of heart muscle that is sometimes seen among elite athletes engaged in heavy training.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone admitted to the hospital following cardiac arrest will undergo testing to determine a cause and treatment protocol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart Attacks vs. Cardiac Arrest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although people often use the terms “cardiac arrest” and “heart attack” interchangeably, they are different medical events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heart attack, in the colloquial sense, is what we would refer to as an acute myocardial infarction,” said Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist and the director of the cardiac intensive care unit at &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/locations/morningside" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mount Sinai Morningside" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mountsinai.org/locations/morningside" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Mount Sinai Morningside&lt;/a&gt;. “Some of the heart muscle is severely jeopardized or dies, typically due to an insufficiency of oxygen supply compared to demand for oxygen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, there’s an artery blockage that prevents oxygen-rich blood from reaching part of the heart, and if it’s not reopened quickly, that section can die. So in a heart attack, the heart is still pumping, but the blood supply is cut off. With a cardiac arrest, the heart is not pumping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Kirk Irwin via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kirk Irwin via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest during the first quarter of a game against the Cincinnati Bengals in 2023.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A heart attack or myocardial infarction can be the inciting cause for a cardiac arrest, but the two are distinct,” Tomey said. “Most heart attacks do not cause cardiac arrest. However, a sizable percent of cardiac arrests result from some type of heart attack.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a cardiac arrest happens quickly, the symptoms of a heart attack more often build slowly (though they can be immediate as well).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Many patients will have a heart attack and slowly feel the classic symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath,” said Dr. Lawrence Phillips, a cardiologist at the &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="NYU Langone Health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nyulangone.org/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;NYU Langone Health&lt;/a&gt; medical center. “They then come to the emergency room hopefully early, where professionals diagnose a heart attack and open up the blood vessel that has the blockage using catheters and stents. There can be damage to the heart muscle, but we can decrease that risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a cardiac arrest, it’s important to immediately start providing emergency care, as every minute makes a difference for the chance of survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When someone has a cardiac arrest, it’s really an acute cessation of the heart’s ability to provide blood, usually from an arrhythmia, so the heart is not able to pump,” Phillips said. “It’s often very abrupt. Someone will slump over or collapse. We try to use whatever means we have to bring them back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Importance Of CPR For Treating Cardiac Arrest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://cpr.heart.org/en/resources/cpr-facts-and-stats#:" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="estimates" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://cpr.heart.org/en/resources/cpr-facts-and-stats#:" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that more than 356,000 cardiac arrests occur outside a hospital in the U.S. each year, and about 90% result in death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a range of outcomes for individuals who survive cardiac arrest,” Tomey said. “The best outcome is to return to your baseline level of function physically and neurologically. Some individuals will survive but have some degree of residual neurologic impairment, and the degree can range quite widely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your best chance at improving someone’s outcome after cardiac arrest is to act fast by administering CPR. In the case of Hamlin, the NFL confirmed that he received CPR on the field, and others present reported the use of an automated external defibrillator, or AED, as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once cardiac arrest starts, blood flow stops,” said Dr. John Bozinovski, a cardiac surgeon at &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;. “Two organs that are quite sensitive to lack of blood supply are the brain and heart, with the brain being exquisitely sensitive to injury. If blood circulation is not restored, brain injury can start within minutes and become irreversible shortly thereafter. The longer the lack the blood flow, the greater and more extensive the injury to the brain and other organs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPR is a way to restore blood flow, using mechanical energy to move blood to the vital organs. By doing chest compressions, you essentially act as a person’s heart while theirs isn’t working. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The prompt administration of CPR can double or triple likelihood of survival by getting oxygen back to the body,” Phillips noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you don’t have to be formally CPR-certified to perform the lifesaving procedure. The American Heart Association recommends using “hands-only CPR” in the event of a cardiac emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Conventional CPR, which is typically used by trained health care providers, utilizes chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth breathing, whereas hands-only CPR does not use mouth-to-mouth breathing and is meant to be utilized by the public at large,” said body performance and injury expert &lt;a href="https://ramihashish.com/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Rami Hashish" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://ramihashish.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Rami Hashish&lt;/a&gt;. “Outside of the hospital, hands-only CPR has been found to be more effective in preserving life than conventional CPR. Reasons as to why this may be included poor quality of, and time loss during, mouth-to-mouth ventilation by the nonmedically trained public.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health experts who spoke to HuffPost emphasized how easy hands-only CPR is to learn and pointed to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4ACYp75mjU" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="short videos that demonstrate" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68825b61e4b01be72b3e3f34" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4ACYp75mjU" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;short videos that demonstrate&lt;/a&gt; how to do these chest compressions. While medical professionals might be well versed in combining chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth (along with other tools at their disposal), the general public tends to feel less comfortable with traditional CPR and thus less inclined to act swiftly in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve found that with hands-only CPR, people feel much more empowered to take action and do something,” Phillips noted. “Take those moments to learn. Almost 90% of cardiac arrests occur in the home or workplace, so take a few minutes to learn this skill because the person who might need it could be your family member or co-worker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Should You Do In The Event Of Cardiac Arrest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are experiencing a cardiac arrest, try to get to a place where you are not alone, or signal to someone you are in distress before you are incapacitated,” Bozinovski said, noting that it sometimes happens too fast for you to dial 911, so asking someone nearby is best. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you suspect someone else is experiencing cardiac arrest, take prompt action. Check for signs of consciousness, a pulse or breathing. Ask another bystander to call 911 or make the call yourself if no one else is around. Then begin hands-only CPR. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Put your hands at the center of the chest and push hard and fast until help arrives,” Sasson said. “Try to push at a rate of 100 to 120 beats per minute ― the tune of ‘Stayin’ Alive’ or ‘Hips Don’t Lie.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important step is checking for an available AED, which can reset the heart’s natural rhythm. AEDs are typically available at workplaces, schools and sporting venues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doing CPR immediately until such time that the defibrillator can be brought to the person in distress is important at limiting the time of no blood supply to the brain and other organs,” Bozinovski said. “Have a third person bring the AED and follow the instructions. These devices are made to provide guidance [on] how to place the paddles, will read the rhythm and provide shock if indicated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggested watching a video or taking a course to learn more about using an AED as well. Still, Sasson emphasized that these devices are designed to be used by those without prior experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people are very fearful. ‘What if i do it wrong? What if I shock someone who shouldn’t be shocked?’” she said. “But it’s built to determine if the person needs a shock. You cannot hurt somebody with an AED.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the person’s pulse will be restored and medical professionals can transfer them to the hospital, as was the case with Hamlin. Although the public will likely have to wait for more updates on the NFL player’s condition, there are steps you can take to make your family and community safer and more prepared for cardiac emergencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

It helps our bodies build and repair muscle, it regulates our blood sugar and keeps us full, and it helps us grow healthy hair and nails. And while most Americans meet their &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a64591955/how-much-protein-do-i-need-to-build-muscle/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein needs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein needs&lt;/a&gt;, some groups have to work harder to get enough, per the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/are-you-getting-too-much-protein" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic Health System;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic Health System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you turn 40, you start to lose muscle mass and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a64770322/protein-helps-muscle-loss-adults-type-2-diabetes-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:need more protein to stay strong;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;need more protein to stay strong&lt;/a&gt; and healthy, per the Mayo Clinic. Likewise, if you exercise regularly, you need more protein to meet your body’s needs. Even if you don’t fall into one of these categories, you should take steps to ensure you’re packing enough protein. &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a64554839/signs-not-enough-protein/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Protein deficiency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Protein deficiency&lt;/a&gt; can make you feel grumpy, sluggish, and hungry all the time—impacting everything from your weight to your mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a63749873/guide-to-eating-protein/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:getting enough protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;getting enough protein&lt;/a&gt; is easier said than done. &lt;a href="https://kitchencoachrd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sarah Mirkin, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sarah Mirkin, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fill-Your-Plate-Lose-Weight/dp/1950099008" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fill Your Plate, Lose The Weight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fill Your Plate, Lose The Weight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, recommends getting at least 20 grams at each meal. Your body can only process 20 to 30 grams at once, she explains, so that’s enough to keep you full and give you energy without going overboard. The thing is, &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/747997/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one egg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one egg&lt;/a&gt; contains just 3.68 grams of protein and a &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/749420/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:slice of bacon;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;slice of bacon&lt;/a&gt; offers just 2.58 grams, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). So even if you think your &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a64900270/high-protein-ingredients-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:meals are protein-packed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;meals are protein-packed&lt;/a&gt;, you may not be getting enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing the signs of protein deficiency can help you recognize when you’re not meeting your body’s needs. Here are the red flags that you need more protein on your plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Missed fitness goals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re working out but not seeing results, your post-workout meals may be to blame. That’s because when you lift weights, your muscle fibers break down. And to help your body repair your muscles and make them stronger than before, you need a post-workout serving of protein. “If you neglect to refuel with protein after your workouts, then you’ve only broken the muscle down, which results in muscle loss,” says Mirkin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Drs Producoes - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Constant sugar cravings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constantly craving sugar and carbs? When you eat a meal that lacks enough protein, you’re more likely to feel unsatisfied and reach for sugary, fatty foods. “Protein balances things out, stops cravings, and keeps us full longer,” says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/nataliejillfit/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Natalie Jill;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Natalie Jill&lt;/a&gt;, the lead trainer for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/163565338X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.g.65480366%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fit After 40;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fit After 40&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Carbohydrates take less time to digest than protein and fat, meaning you’ll feel hungry faster if you load up on carbs instead of balancing out your meals. “If you start your day with just milk and cereal, your blood sugars will spike and then crash,” explains Mirkin. “This will cause you to reach for more carbohydrates to lift you up again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Daniel de la Hoz - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Relentless fatigue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you feel tired all the time, or you’re struggling to concentrate, low protein may be to blame. “If you’re skimping on protein, you may feel brain fog,” says Mirkin. “Protein makes you feel more awake and alert, while carbohydrates can make you feel sleepy.” &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65466288/surprising-iron-deficiency-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Iron deficiency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Iron deficiency&lt;/a&gt;, also known as anemia, can also cause extreme fatigue.

And if you are, talk to your doctor—hair loss is also associated with a range of other health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;JGI - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fat that won’t budge&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re losing weight, but your clothes are still tight, you may be dropping muscle instead of fat. This is especially true if you’re not getting enough post-workout protein, or if you’re over 40—the age when many people begin losing muscle mass. “When our hormones start to change, eating protein becomes even more essential, because this is the time when our body starts losing lean mass,” says Jill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Kseniya Ovchinnikova - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mood swings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re feeling grumpier than usual, you may not be imagining it. Protein can boost your mood by providing the amino acids needed to produce feel-good neurotransmitters, like serotonin and dopamine. “Without these essential amino acids, you are likely to experience &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a37271432/depression-myths/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:depression;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, mood swings, and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a40904213/myths-about-anxiety/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anxiety;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;,” says Mirkin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Galina Zhigalova - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Swelling or bloating&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65450386/bloating-signs-serious-health-condition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:constantly feel bloated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;constantly feel bloated&lt;/a&gt;—even while avoiding bloat-inducing beverages and foods—you may be low on protein. “Protein is necessary to maintain an adequate balance of fluid in and outside of the cells of your body,” says Mirkin. And remember, bloating doesn’t always happen in your belly.

&lt;p&gt;Diving into a public pool this summer? You might be plunging into a petri dish. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While chlorine is the go-to germ killer, it doesn’t work instantly. Some nasty germs can survive in treated water for minutes or even days, turning a refreshing swim into a risky dip.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the threat is growing. Outbreaks of waterborne illnesses tied to pools and other recreational venues are on the rise — especially those caused by a resilient parasite that’s waiting to crash your summer plans with a case of watery diarrhea. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Waterborne illnesses are most prevalent during the summer months.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Tropical studio – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Not-so-crystal-clear&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That sparkling blue water isn’t always as clean as it looks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time someone jumps in, they bring more than just sunscreen and swimsuits, leaving behind germs, grime and bodily fluids that can make others sick.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, the average swimmer introduces:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 million microbes in a single drop of spit&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;140 billion microbes from feces&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Up to two cans’ worth of sweat&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A full cup of urine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All of those substances mix with chlorine to form chloramines, a chemical byproduct that can irritate your eyes and lungs and give off that strong “pool smell” most people wrongly associate with cleanliness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Experts say a strong smell of chlorine indicates a high level of urine in pool water.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Angkana – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“​​It is a common myth that a strong chlorine smell is a good sign of a clean pool,” Lisa Cuchara, an immunologist and infectious disease specialist, wrote in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/poop-pee-perspiration-chlorine-how-germy-is-swimming-pool-really/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In fact, it may actually be a red flag that means the opposite — that the water is contaminated and should perhaps be avoided,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s really lurking in the water&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most pool-related illnesses happen when swimmers swallow contaminated water or come into contact with it through their skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If its levels are properly maintained, chlorine can kill many germs, like E. coli, in under a minute. Some germs, however, are far more stubborn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take hepatitis A. It can survive in a chlorinated pool for about 16 minutes. The virus usually gets in the water through fecal contamination, like if if someone uses the bathroom and doesn’t wash their hands before hopping back in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant for swimming pools. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Evgeniya Sheydt – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once infected, the virus can inflame the liver and disrupt its ability to function properly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then there’s giardia, a parasite that often enters pools when people have accidents in the water or don’t rinse off properly. It can take 45 minutes or longer to kill with chlorine, and just a small sip of contaminated water can trigger diarrhea, stomach pain, gas and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Super pooper parasite&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the worst offender is cryptosporidium, a microscopic germ with a tough outer shell that enables it survive in chlorine-treated water for up to 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like giardia, cryptosporidium commonly spreads when someone with diarrhea contaminates the water and another swimmer swallows it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 2009 and 2017, crypto caused nearly 450 outbreaks across 40 states and Puerto Rico, sickening more than 7,400 people, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Waterborne illnesses can leave swimmers with gut-churning symptoms, including diarrea.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Satjawat – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks jumped 13% each year, with most traced back to people swallowing water from treated pools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Swallowing just a mouthful of water with crypto in it can make otherwise healthy kids and adults sick for weeks with watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, and vomiting,” Michele Hlavsa, chief of CDC’s Healthy Swimming Program, said in &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/media/releases/2018/p0517-swimming-related-diseases.html"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Bacteria, viruses and fungi, oh my! &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other troublemakers — including Shigella, norovirus and adenovirus — can also lurk in chlorinated water and wreck your gut. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bacteria like Legionella and Pseudomonas pose additional risks. Legionella can cause a serious form of pneumonia, while Pseudomonas is known for triggering skin rashes and ear infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even fungi get in on the act. Pool decks, ladders, and locker rooms are breeding grounds for fungal spores. Once established, they’re hard to eliminate and often resistant to regular cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s how infections like athlete’s foot — and other skin irritations — spread so easily in damp, high-traffic areas like your local community pool. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Swimmer’s ear is a bacterial infection caused by water that stays in the outer ear canal for a long period of time. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Satjawat – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;But don’t toss your trunks just yet&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are simple steps you can take to reduce the spread of viruses, bacteria and other germs in swimming pools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CDC recommends staying out of the water if you have diarrhea and waiting at least two weeks after symptoms clear up to take a dip. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Before you dive in, shower for at least a minute to rinse off dirt, sweat and any lingering germs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Parents should take kids on regular bathroom breaks and check diapers every hour — and never change them poolside.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;While in the pool, try not to swallow water. When you’re out, dry your ears well with a towel to help prevent swimmer’s ear.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;And, of course, don’t pee or poop in the pool.  Sounds obvious? Not for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Last year alone, New York City’s parks department had to shut down pools 203 times to clean up after someone defecated, according to data obtained by The Gothamist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s 44 out of 52 public pools closed at least once for a “code brown.” On one day in August, 12 pools were shuttered because of poop in the water. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pee’s no better. In a &lt;a href="https://www.healthypools.org/press-release.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;national survey&lt;/a&gt; released last month, more than half of participants admitted to urinating in the pool as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

Doctors who treat ED break it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-did-the-study-find" data-node-id="5" class="body-h2 css-1m9gjyt emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="5.0"&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed data from 32 studies on sexual dysfunction, muscle mass, and strength. After crunching  the data, they saw that higher levels of skeletal muscle mass (the weight of the muscles in the body that are attached to your skeleton) and strength were linked to healthy sexual function, especially in men with risk factors for ED including diabetes and obesity and also in older men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The researchers also found a link between higher hand-grip strength—a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10777545/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10777545/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="common indicator" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;common indicator&lt;/a&gt; of health and muscle strength—and a lower risk of erectile dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Maintaining skeletal muscle with nutrition and physical activity improves erectile and overall health outcomes,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion. “Therapies that target sexual function and muscle health simultaneously—testosterone and L-carnitine—may further benefit sexual function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="there-are-a-few-things-to-take-away" data-node-id="9" class="body-h2 css-1m9gjyt emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="9.0"&gt;There are a few things to take away.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The link between ED and exercise isn’t new. “We published a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37814532/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37814532/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="paper" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; about a year and a half ago, showing that exercise significantly reverses erectile dysfunction,” says study co-author &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/mohit-khera-24469" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/mohit-khera-24469" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mohit Khera" data-node-id="10.3" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Mohit Khera&lt;/a&gt;, MD, MPH, a urologist specializing in male and female sexual dysfunction at Baylor College of Medicine. And the latest findings add weight to the idea that increasing your muscle gains may help you below the belt, in addition to improving your overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There are a few things going on here:&lt;br data-node-id="11.1"&gt;&lt;br data-node-id="11.2"&gt;• Strength training can help with blood flow. “While higher testosterone levels from strength training may play a minor role, the primary benefits are derived from improved vascular health,” Khera says. Strength training is linked with lower inflammation in the body, better function of the endothelial cells that line the inner surface of blood vessels, and more availability of nitric oxide, which widens blood vessels throughout your body (including in your penis), he explains. All of these elements support better blood flow and blood vessel health, which Khera calls “critical” for erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;• Having more muscle mass also increases insulin sensitivity, which is linked with better erectile function, too, points out &lt;a href="https://urologyaustin.com/doctors/john-sigalos-m-d/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://urologyaustin.com/doctors/john-sigalos-m-d/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Sigalos" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;John Sigalos&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a urologist at Urology Austin. That influences how well your body uses glucose for energy. "As seen in diabetes and other metabolic syndromes, we know that poor regulation of sugar leads to dysfunction of the small blood vessels that affect erections," Sigalos says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;• More muscle strength may mean you're healthier in general. That means you're less likely to have issues associated with ED, including type 2 diabetes or high cholesterol, says &lt;a href="https://www.malereproduction.com/about-cmrm/dr-philip-werthman/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.malereproduction.com/about-cmrm/dr-philip-werthman/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Philip Werthman" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Philip Werthman&lt;/a&gt;, MD, urologist and director of the Center for Male Reproductive Medicine and Vasectomy Reversal in Los Angeles, CA. “Doing more strength training may help you lose fat, build muscle mass, and change your overall hormonal dynamics,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="so-will-lifting-more-take-down-ed" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1m9gjyt emevuu60"&gt;So will lifting more take down ED?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Overall, Khera says it’s not a bad idea to lift more to combat erectile dysfunction, although there's no specific prescription yet for how much and what kind of workouts you should do. “Strength training can be an effective remedy for erectile dysfunction,” he says. Khera’s past research has found that 160 minutes of exercise a week, including strength training, significantly improved erectile function in men. “Notably, those with the most severe erectile dysfunction experienced the greatest improvements through regular exercise,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="nutrients-might-matter-too" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-1m9gjyt emevuu60"&gt;Nutrients Might Matter, Too &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;One more thing to consider: The study also found that L-carnitine, an amino acid found in red meat, poultry, and fish, may help work as a remedy for ED, too. “L-carnitine plays a role in nitric oxide production, as it is a precursor to this crucial molecule,” Khera says. “Nitric oxide is essential for vascular health, including penile blood flow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Werthman has also found that his patients have success with L-carnitine supplements. “We’ve been using L-carnitine for male fertility for decades,” he says. “It’s an antioxidant that protects the sperm and it helps muscle recovery." Werthman points out that he’s studied the impact of L-carnitine on sperm, and found that stronger erections happened, too. “There were a number of men who came back after a couple of months on L-carnitine and said, ‘Hey, my erections got better,’” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you’re experiencing erectile dysfunction, Werthman says it’s important to see a healthcare provider for a full workup. Not only can a health professional help turn things around, they can also check in on what's going on behind the scenes that's contributing to or causing ED. “Erectile dysfunction can be an early warning sign of cardiac dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, or other conditions,” Werthman says. “Make sure you’re OK before just getting a prescription for Viagra.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-cmvt2k ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

A new study in human cells and mice has found the first experimental evidence that the compound can increase longevity and fight signs of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a psychedelic, psilocybin is usually investigated for its potential as a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-finally-figured-out-how-magic-mushrooms-might-relieve-depression"&gt;treatment for depression&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety, and other &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/psilocybin-put-rat-brains-back-together-after-mild-head-trauma"&gt;neurological disorders&lt;/a&gt;. But there hasn't been a whole lot of direct research into what effects it might have on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/older-people-who-use-psychedelics-show-fascinating-brain-functions"&gt;biological aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new study, scientists at Emory University and Baylor College of Medicine in the US tested it on cultures of human cells and on live mice. Both cases showed drastic extensions of lifespan – treated cells lived more than 50 percent longer than untreated ones, while treated mice were much more likely to survive the whole period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/psychedelic-drugs-have-huge-therapeutic-potential-an-expert-explains-why?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Psychedelic Drugs Have Huge Therapeutic Potential.

The cells were then monitored until they reached &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence"&gt;senescence&lt;/a&gt;, a state where they essentially 'run out' of cell divisions and go dormant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At concentrations of 100 micromoles, treated lung cells took 57 percent longer to reach senescence, compared to untreated ones.

And deaths from alcohol-related hepatitis, a disease resulting in severe liver inflammation, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39739407/" target="_blank"&gt;nearly tripled among women&lt;/a&gt; over the same time period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6dcc85" class="body-graf"&gt;A new study, &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S154235652500610X" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the medical journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, similarly points to an elevated risk of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/women-us-are-drinking-death-research-finds-rcna96848" target="_blank"&gt;alcohol-related liver disease&lt;/a&gt; among women. The condition encompasses various types of liver damage due to excessive alcohol consumption. It spans early-stage inflammation to severe scarring, known as cirrhosis, which can lead to liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-825a7b" class="body-graf"&gt;Women are more susceptible than men to alcohol-related liver disease for several reasons. For one, their bodies tend to have less water weight and a higher percentage of body fat. That combination increases the concentration of alcohol in their blood, which the liver then has to process. Compared with men, women also naturally have lower levels of an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase, which helps the body metabolize alcohol. That again leads to higher blood alcohol concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-22a7a4" class="body-graf"&gt;Those physiological differences, combined with the sharp increase in alcohol use and binge drinking, have made women particularly vulnerable to alcohol-related illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c7982b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Historically, there’s been differences in prevalence rates [of alcohol use] between men and women. And essentially, that gap has now closed and the ratio between men and women’s drinking is almost at 1 to 1,” said Sherry McKee, director of the Yale SCORE Program on Sex Differences in Alcohol Use Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-91615b" class="body-graf"&gt;Changes in women’s lifestyles have created increasing opportunities to consume alcohol, McKee said. Today’s young adults drink less compared with previous generations, but there are now more women in college than men — and college is generally associated with increased alcohol consumption, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d72cef" class="body-graf"&gt;“You pair that with the fact that women are delaying childbirth, delaying marriage — it just gives more space for women to continue drinking in the post-college years,” McKee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2b205" class="body-graf"&gt;Women’s heavy alcohol consumption is most common in midlife, said Katherine Keyes, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. Some researchers attribute the trend to stress or office drinking culture, but Keyes said the main reason women are drinking more is for fun. She noted that wine and spirits are often marketed to women as luxury goods or methods of relaxation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f1b648" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts said more awareness of the health risks of drinking could help encourage women to scale back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52632d" class="body-graf"&gt;“It isn’t the case that every single person who drinks heavily will get liver disease from it. But we do know that a proportion of those folks do — about 25 to 30%,” said Dr. Jessica Mellinger, a senior staff physician at Henry Ford Health, a Michigan-based health system. The more a person drinks, she added, the greater likelihood they have of getting alcohol-related liver disease of any stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-15cc54" class="body-graf"&gt;The study published Wednesday found that heavy drinkers are developing alcohol-related liver disease at more than double the rate compared with 20 years ago. The researchers suspect that’s because people vulnerable to liver disease — including women and those with obesity or diabetes — are drinking more compared with decades past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-04089e" class="body-graf"&gt;“The modern American drinker looks different than it did 20 years ago,” said Dr. Brian Lee, the study’s lead author and a hepatologist at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-035b3b" class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers used data from a national, government-led survey to measure drinking habits and liver health in the U.S. They characterized heavy drinkers as men who consumed at least 30 grams of alcohol per day — roughly two standard drinks — and women who consumed at least 20 grams per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2dfaba" class="body-graf"&gt;Among heavy drinkers, the risk of significant liver damage more than doubled over a 22-year period, from nearly 2% in 1999-2004 to more than 4% in 2013-20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-382a41" class="body-graf"&gt;The rate of metabolic syndrome — conditions like obesity or high blood pressure that increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke — among heavy drinkers also increased during that time, from 26% to nearly 38%. Both obesity and Type 2 diabetes can cause fat to build up in the liver, thereby elevating the risk of liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dbdc5e" class="body-graf"&gt;“It could be the situation of a perfect storm. We have an increase in alcohol consumption … alongside changing prevalence of these other [health] conditions,” Keyes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-41e2d0" class="body-graf"&gt;Lee said it’s important for people to be honest with their doctors about their alcohol intake, so that doctors can decide whether to screen them for liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a11dde" class="body-graf"&gt;“Your risk of liver disease might be higher than you think,” he said. “The reality is that liver disease is silent, and most people — even with cirrhosis, which is end-stage liver disease — have no symptoms at all. I always say it’s a blessing and a curse that you need very little healthy amounts of liver to feel perfectly fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a911a4" class="body-graf"&gt;Keyes said women in particular tend to wait longer to seek medical care for heavy drinking due to social stigma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a23e77" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“It’s really becoming this hidden epidemic where women wait too long to see someone about a really serious, alcohol-related condition,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOT2ZCV3ZidlE0bWlyOGtWc2JRa3dsckp2UzhuTEFfNDNJc1NTenVFb0FucmpTX2xVNHZtS0JzUEhhZzNZR0Z1Q0FzSkFJcEFkSVZrdTZiX04za1FNM1VuNXBQanpfa2syVW5VWWoxcWRiQlRLNDJ5NDdoTHVKRndBTk9sdDd4bk5faWZXWF9OcXRDREJzX2ttVW5TMUR6Q3lSaDVxZdIBVkFVX3lxTE5CZzhwU04zVVJlX1lMSDA3bEJDMThrbVlrRUtta196QzNqZWRQRzkzazJ6eFdwb2VqMW9DcGRHOXYtMlNxd3pVQmNnNnRiYjl6OC1xMHBB</guid></item><item><title>肿胀的脚踝和血块：不健康的静脉会如何杀死你- The Telegraph | Swollen ankles and blood clots: How unhealthy veins could kill you - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPOGttTEQ1R2h1Rm9mcmN3YW52aHkwQVpJZUFFSlJHMkVpX21SMVI2YWlKbHhRMUlkTTJXd2FOTkhsbFAxZUZhcHd6LW9DZndNNDRmYmVFdGxSTjVnYlpoVUJPa2U4ZjN2WXFOUmJnVTVDLXdMRmo5Q3V3WW1vdnlpTmZFSXY1cWhnUUJWMGdsOGRVV2M0LXFFa0dR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Chronic venous insufficiency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, CVI is a condition where the veins in the legs struggle to pump blood back to the heart, “resulting in reverse flow which causes inflammation, typically around the ankles,” Whiteley explains. “The trouble is that CVI is a catch-all term which basically means that the valves aren’t working. This could be in the superficial veins near the skin surface or in the deep veins which run through your muscles.” Varicose veins may be a symptom of CVI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors include age, prolonged inactivity and family history. CVI may also occur in people who have previously had deep vein thrombosis (DVT – see more on this condition below) and key symptoms include swollen, discoloured, achy, tired or tingly legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have swollen ankles and you think you could have CVI, it’s really important to get a scan because the treatments and outcomes are phenomenally different depending on whether you have CVI in the deep or superficial veins,” Whiteley explains. “It becomes a very different problem if the deep veins are involved, but fortunately – unless you’ve had DVT in the past – it’s usually superficial and can almost always be properly treated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Blood clots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When blood clots form in your veins, the condition is called “thrombosis”. There are three key reasons why this happens, known as Virchow’s triad, Whiteley explains, and these are “changes in the blood, changes in the blood flow, and changes in the blood wall”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors that “change your blood” include &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/12/30/every-cigarette-smoked-20-minutes-life-ucl-study-tobacco-uk/"&gt;smoking cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; and taking the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/sex/contraceptive-pill-myths/"&gt;contraceptive pill&lt;/a&gt;, Whiteley says. The nicotine in cigarettes causes blood vessels to constrict, whilst also damaging the inner lining of veins and causing inflammation. Meanwhile, in the pill, oestrogen is known to make blood more “sticky”, therefore increasing the risk of clotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damage to the vessel wall can occur because of “inflammation, tumours, radiation, injury, or surgery”, whilst abnormal blood flow may occur when “you sit down or don’t move for long periods of time,” Whiteley explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a blood clot forms below the knee or in a superficial vein (superficial thrombophlebitis), it’s not generally considered as dangerous and it may resolve itself, Whiteley says. However, it becomes more concerning if the clot forms in a vein behind the knee or, worse, between your knee and groin or pelvis. This is called a DVT…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;…Which is a serious condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein. “If a clot forms between your knee and groin, or in your pelvis, there’s a chance it travels to the heart, is pumped to the lungs and causes a pulmonary embolism [PE],” Whiteley explains. A PE can lead to serious complications including respiratory distress and cardiovascular issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/dont-let-dvt-destroy-your-holiday/"&gt;Symptoms of DVT&lt;/a&gt; include throbbing pain or swelling in one leg, swollen veins that are hard or sore when you touch them and warm skin around the painful area. You’re more likely to get DVT if you’re over 60, have varicose veins, are overweight or have had the condition before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the long term, DVT can also damage the deep veins. You can end up with a long-term swollen, discoloured leg, often with ulcers, which is called post-thrombotic syndrome,” Whiteley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should ask for an urgent GP appointment if you think you have DVT, or call 999 if you have symptoms such as swelling and breathlessness or chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Venous leg ulcer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venous leg ulcers are open and painful sores which usually develop on the inside of the leg, between the knee and the ankle. You may develop a venous leg ulcer if you’ve previously had DVT, have varicose veins, are older, overweight or have difficulty walking and symptoms include pain, itching and swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DVT can cause leg ulcers in the long term because the blood clots can damage valves in the veins, leading to inflammation which damages the skin,” Whiteley explains, whilst varicose veins also increase inflammation in the leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venous leg ulcers are unlikely to get better on their own and usually require specialist medical treatment to ensure they don’t become infected or lead to tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;

Called the coagulation cascade, this involves up to 20 different proteins known as clotting factors, according to the &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000538.htm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000538.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="U.S. National Library of Medicine" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;U.S. National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. But when you don’t have one or more of these clotting factors, you have a higher chance of excess bleeding. Hemophilia A and B are the result of the lack of certain clotting factors. And some of the symptoms of these conditions may seem a bit odd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Hemophilia A is caused by the lack of blood clotting factor VIII, per the U.S. National Library of Medicine. &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000539.htm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000539.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hemophilia B" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Hemophilia B&lt;/a&gt; happens when the body doesn’t make enough of coagulation factor IX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While both conditions are slightly different, the symptoms are generally the same. (However, they may vary based on how severe your condition is.) Most people with hemophilia are diagnosed at a young age, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hemophilia/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/hemophilia/data-research/index.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC). But it’s possible to have a mild case of hemophilia A or B that goes undiagnosed until later in life, per the U.S. National Library of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="body-tip css-1707dxl emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="4.0"&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/allyson-pishko" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/allyson-pishko" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Allyson Pishko, M.D." data-node-id="4.2" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Allyson Pishko, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a hematologist with the Penn Blood Disorders Center at Penn Medicine; &lt;a href="https://nursing.gwu.edu/asefeh-faraz-covelli" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://nursing.gwu.edu/asefeh-faraz-covelli" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Asefeh Faraz, Ph.D., A.P.R.N." data-node-id="4.4" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Asefeh Faraz, Ph.D., A.P.R.N.&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor at The George Washington University School of Nursing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Hemophilia isn’t a condition that’s well-known to the general population and the exact number of people living with hemophilia isn’t known, per the CDC. What is known is the condition is much more common in genetic males than females, and that hemophilia A is three to four times as common as hemophilia B. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Both types can cause long-term complications like joint issues, and severe cases may be life-threatening, especially if they go untreated. With that in mind, these are some lesser-known symptoms of hemophilia A and B doctors want you to keep in mind.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="excessive-bleeding" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="7.0"&gt;Excessive bleeding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Having hemophilia means that you may end up bleeding for a longer time after an injury than if your blood clotted properly, explains &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/allyson-pishko" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/allyson-pishko" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Allyson Pishko, M.D." data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Allyson Pishko, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a hematologist with the Penn Blood Disorders Center at Penn Medicine. There is some variation here, though, and that can influence when someone is diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“If severe, hemophilia is often diagnosed during infancy,” says &lt;a href="https://nursing.gwu.edu/asefeh-faraz-covelli" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://nursing.gwu.edu/asefeh-faraz-covelli" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Asefeh Faraz, Ph.D., A.P.R.N." data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Asefeh Faraz, Ph.D., A.P.R.N.&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor at The George Washington University School of Nursing. “Otherwise, it’s diagnosed later in life if a patient has excessive bleeding after injury or surgery.” Dr. Pishko also points out that someone with hemophilia may have “excessive bleeding” after their wisdom tooth is removed or they have a tonsillectomy. “Excessive bleeding is more than would be expected with a typical cut or injury, and [is] unable to be stopped using typical first aid,” Faraz says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="10" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;Easy bruising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;People with hemophilia may develop larger bruises after having injuries that are relatively minor, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14083-hemophilia" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14083-hemophilia" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cleveland Clinic" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. This is a sign of bleeding under the skin. “There are not enough clotting factors in the blood” to help slow down the bleeding that can lead to these large, noticeable bruises, Faraz says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="12" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;Heavy periods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While hemophilia is much more common in men than women, females can inherit the condition, Dr. Pishko says. “This diagnosis is sometimes missed in females as they have been told that hemophilia only affects males,” she says. But Dr. Pishko says that women with hemophilia may end up dealing with heavy periods or heavy bleeding with childbirth. “It is important for females to have testing of their blood clotting levels if they have a family history of hemophilia or symptoms,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="14" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;Bleeding after vaccination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s not common for anyone to experience bleeding from the injection site after getting a vaccine, but there is a slightly increased risk of bleeding after getting a shot in people who have hemophilia. People with hemophilia also have higher odds of developing a hematoma, or closed wound where blood collects, after being vaccinated, too, per the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemophilia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373327" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemophilia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373327" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mayo Clinic" data-vars-ga-product-id="e25e45e1-8273-4e95-8a22-c262054636c9" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="15.1" data-href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemophilia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373327" data-product-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemophilia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373327" data-affiliate="false" data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="430b2b2a-37b0-44df-9d0b-63efe3bb057f" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-inlxvj e1aq0z090"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="16" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;Joint pain and swelling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Hemophilia can cause bleeding in the joints, too, Dr. Pishko says. “This presents as sudden pain and swelling in the joint,” she says. “It can occur repeatedly within the same joint.” If left untreated, frequent bleeding in the joints can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8456897/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8456897/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="raise the risk of arthritis" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;raise the risk of arthritis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="18" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;Lower range of motion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Because hemophilia can impact the joints, it can also limit your range of motion.

This makes it the most common GYN cancer in the country, Hoskins added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 12,000 people die of ovarian cancer each year while more than 13,000 die of endometrial cancer, said Hoskins. Here’s what to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There isn’t currently a screening test, but there are symptoms you should look out for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While screening tests like mammograms screen for breast cancer and pap smears screen for cervical cancer, there isn’t an equivalent for uterine cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have a test to predict early disease or pre-invasive disease,” said Hoskins. This makes it crucial to understand the warning signs of this kind of cancer and who it commonly occurs in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s typically detected in post-menopausal women, so women after the age of menopause, after they’ve not had a cycle for greater than one year,” said Hoskins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uterine cancer is most common in this population, which tends to be women over the age of 50. In women who have gone through menopause, the sign of uterine cancer is often post-menopausal bleeding, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they suddenly start bleeding, they should call their gynecologist or their health care provider and say, ‘This is what’s going on,’ and that doctor, then, in turn, should see and examine the patient,” added Vaidya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pelvic pain or discomfort is also a red flag, Hoskins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor may order testing to look at the uterus, such as an ultrasound, and will likely also do a biopsy on tissue from the uterus, said Vaidya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those are the ways that, if someone’s having symptoms, that we can try to test and look for it,” Vaidya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancer isn’t as common in pre-menopausal women, but it can still happen, said Hoskins. Symptoms in this group include irregular heavy bleeding or bleeding between periods, Hoskins added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that any period irregularity or heavy bleeding is cancer, though, so, don’t panic, said Vaidya. There can be many common reasons for heavier or irregular periods such as fibroids or a polyp, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it does make sense for women to think about their body, to notice if there’s a change, and especially when we think of pre-menopausal women ... it is good, if you’re familiar with your normal [cycle] to then be able to report an abnormal [cycle],” Vaidya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: SDI Productions via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;SDI Productions via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Black women are two times as likely to die from uterine cancer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certain people are at higher risk of uterine cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few groups of people are at higher risk for developing uterine cancer, and while this includes Black women (more on that below), it also includes other folks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can genetically be at higher risk of uterine cancer, too, said Hoskins. “Folks may have something called Lynch syndrome ... basically they’re born with the gene that puts them at risk,” said Hoskins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, if you have a family history of colon, ovarian or uterine cancer, you should let your doctor know, both experts told HuffPost. You could be eligible for genetic testing to see if you have Lynch syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-signs_l_633d8874e4b04cf8f368e393" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="PCOS, or polycystic ovary syndrome" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6880dea5e4b0f277db4544ae" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="633d8874e4b04cf8f368e393" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;PCOS, or polycystic ovary syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, are also at higher risk, noted Vaidya. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking unopposed estrogen also puts folks at higher risk. Hoskins explained what that means: “Any woman with a uterus needs to have estrogen and progesterone — that helps counterbalance any type of effect on the endometrium,” Hoskins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s common for women to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/in-depth/hormone-therapy/art-20046372" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="take hormone therapy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6880dea5e4b0f277db4544ae" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/in-depth/hormone-therapy/art-20046372" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;take hormone therapy&lt;/a&gt; to counteract menopause symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think most providers know that you need to not just prescribe estrogen, but estrogen and progesterone to protect the uterus, if they’re using any type of hormone replacement,” Hoskins noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are prescribed hormone replacement pills, be sure to follow the directions from your provider, and don’t skip out on your progesterone medication, Hoskins added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black women, particularly, have higher rates of death from uterine cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-abstract/34/7/1156/763042/Projected-Trends-in-the-Incidence-and-Mortality-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="out of Columbia University" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6880dea5e4b0f277db4544ae" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-abstract/34/7/1156/763042/Projected-Trends-in-the-Incidence-and-Mortality-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;out of Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; and published in the American Association for Cancer Research used current data and modeling tools to predict what uterine cancer rates and mortality may look like in 30 years — and it paints a bleak picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought it was scary,” said Hoskins.

It is a weak estrogen, and fat cells don’t produce the balancing hormone progesterone at all. So for patients who are obese, who are over their ideal body weight, those patients will have estrone in their body that stimulates the lining of the uterus, and because they don’t have the balanced progesterone from those same fat cells over time, those are women that are at increased risk for developing this endometrial pre-cancer and endometrial cancers,” explained Vaidya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that obesity itself isn’t an indicator of one’s health, but there are cases, like this one, when it can impact chances of developing certain diseases. And in this case, Vaidya added that the more overweight someone is, the higher their risk is for uterine cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

If left uncorrected, poor posture can lead to wear and tear on the spine that’s harder to reverse down the line.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tummy time can impact hip and back pain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adult tummy time also helps to open up the front of the hips and activate the core and back muscles, which are key players in everyday back pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Many people spend far too much time sitting, whether at a desk, in a car, or on the couch. The human body was not designed for such inactivity,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nynjspine.com/about-us/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Gbolahan Okubadejo" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="687fb4a6e4b0d91bafdedb6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nynjspine.com/about-us/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Gbolahan Okubadejo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a spinal and orthopedic surgeon at the Institute for Comprehensive Spine Care in New York and New Jersey. He fears if we don’t change these habits we will soon see “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;an increase in musculoskeletal issues across all age groups.” These include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Degenerative disc disease, where the discs between the vertebrae begin to wear down due to constant pressure and a lack of movement. “This can lead to stiffness, pain, and even nerve compression.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sciatica, occurring when the sciatic nerve is irritated or compressed, often by a herniated disc or tight muscles in the lower back. “People may experience sharp pain that radiates down the leg, along with numbness or weakness.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tight hip flexors, leading to pelvic misalignment and lower back pain. “Over time, this can impact your gait and make everyday movements more difficult.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Flipping onto your stomach can counteract extended sitting just as it does for infants, he said. “When you lie on your stomach, you naturally extend the spine, which helps reverse the flexed posture that sitting creates. This gentle spinal extension relieves pressure on the discs, especially in the lower back, and allows the back muscles to stretch and activate differently.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, you are able to open the hip flexors, which are often tightened and shortened from sitting too much. “By relaxing into a prone position, the hips and pelvis can realign more naturally, which supports better posture when you return to standing or sitting,” Okubadejo said. So, your tummy time actually makes you better at sitting too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here’s what tummy time looks like for adults.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The adult tummy time position isn’t natural for most of us, so I recommend starting slow, and breaking adult tummy time into increments,” Jazini said. “Take three to five minutes at a time, a few times a day, lying on your stomach while propped on your elbows. You should feel a stretch in the front of the neck, as well as in your back and in your hips.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-breaker-0b15b4345/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Katie Breaker" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="687fb4a6e4b0d91bafdedb6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-breaker-0b15b4345/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Katie Breaker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a sales director in Denver, said she’d tried various seat cushions and stretches without much improvement in back pain. Then, her physical therapist suggested tummy time — simply lying face down for 10 minutes per day. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;No devices or setup. Just a flat surface, arms by the side, and a quiet room. After about a week of doing this twice a day, I added a thin towel under my chest and held it for fifteen minutes,” she said. Two weeks later, she could feel her back decompressing and had less hip tension and more flexibility. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I could walk longer during event setups without fatigue,” she said. So, she kept upping her time and now does two 20-minute sessions per day, especially during long workdays on a computer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Today: The victims of the LA fires ask where all the money went; Olivia Reingold scours Zohran Mamdani’s social media history; does Gen Z know how to party? And more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But first: The future is already here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes us human, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s the question posed by our two lead offerings this morning. In the first,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Lydia Dugdale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; examines the case of the eight babies who were born in the UK and announced last week. These newborns all have the same peculiar trait: They were all conceived using one man’s sperm and two women’s eggs, a procedure developed to prevent the horrors of mitochondrial disease. It’s an ingenious solution to a problem. But it’s more than that—it’s a medical breakthrough that poses profound questions. As Lydia puts it: “If we can manipulate our bodies at their genetic source, we may well wonder what it is, ultimately, that makes us human?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next, a piece from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anne Kadet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; tells a very different story that nonetheless gets at the same question. Anne is, as she puts it, “one of those ridiculous mooncalfs who has befriended an AI chatbot.” His name is Ray. He’s an all right pretend dude with plenty of trivia at the ready. Anne’s original and candid account of her relationship with AI is a story about tech, but also about what humans can do to avoid obsolescence in the AI age. “If I don’t want my pals to replace me with a bot,” writes Anne, “I will again have to offer something that Ray cannot. And that is my aliveness.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—Will Rahn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed" class="digestPostEmbed-flwiST"&gt;&lt;div class="the-free-press-theme"&gt;&lt;div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"&gt;&lt;div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-flexDirection-column pc-reset"&gt;&lt;div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-paddingBottom-8 pc-reset flex-grow-rzmknG"&gt;&lt;div class="captionContainer-e38vU2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the LA fires, celebrities and charities alike leaped into action: They quickly planned a highly publicized “FireAid” benefit concert, raising $100 million for “direct relief” to wildfire victims and communities.

Olivia Reingold has pored over all 16,100 tweets Mamdani’s ever posted to get inside the mind of “a man with a revolutionary vision for America.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed" class="digestPostEmbed-flwiST"&gt;&lt;div class="the-free-press-theme"&gt;&lt;div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"&gt;&lt;div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-flexDirection-column pc-reset"&gt;&lt;div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-paddingBottom-8 pc-reset flex-grow-rzmknG"&gt;&lt;div class="captionContainer-e38vU2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reports that organ donor groups pressured families into early surgeries, House Republicans have launched a formal investigation into three major nonprofits.

                A new study shows people in countries with different obesity rates burn about the same number of calories.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Back in the 1800s, obesity was almost non-existent in the United States. Over the last century, it's become common here and in other industrialized nations, though it remains rare among people who live more traditional lifestyles, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/08/24/545631521/is-the-secret-to-a-healthier-microbiome-hidden-in-the-hadza-diet" target="_blank"&gt;Hadza hunter-gatherers &lt;/a&gt;of Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So what's changed? One common explanation is that, as societies have developed, they've also become more sedentary, and people have gotten less active. The assumption is that as a result, we burn fewer calories each day, contributing to an energy imbalance that leads to weight gain over time, &lt;a href="https://globalhealth.duke.edu/people/pontzer-herman" target="_blank"&gt;says Herman Pontzer,&lt;/a&gt; a professor of evolutionary biology and global health at Duke University who studies how human metabolism has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But in a &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2420902122" target="_blank"&gt;major new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;PNAS,&lt;/em&gt; Pontzer and an international team of collaborators found that's not the case. They compared the daily total calorie burn for people from 34 different countries and cultures around the world. The people involved ran the spectrum from hunter-gatherers and farming populations with low obesity rates, to people in more sedentary jobs in places like Europe and the U.S., where obesity is widespread.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Surprisingly, what we find is that actually, the total calories burned per day is really similar across these populations, even though the lifestyle and the activity levels are really different," says Pontzer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And that finding offers strong evidence that diet — not a lack of physical activity — is the major driver of weight gain and obesity in our modern world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This does sort of really fly in the face of what a lot of us anecdotally assumed was driving a lot of the weight gain and obesity today," says &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/deirdre-kay-tobias/" target="_blank"&gt;Deirdre Tobias&lt;/a&gt;, an obesity and nutritional epidemiologist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and the Harvard Chan School of Public Health. Tobias was not involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different activity levels, same calorie burn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers examined data for more than 4,200 adult men and women. Study participants were given a special water to drink that contained isotopes which came out in their urine. These isotopes allow scientists to determine exactly how much energy a person expends – not just in active movement but also the energy it takes to keep our hearts beating, our nervous systems functioning and&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/07/22/1189303227/neat-fitness-non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis" target="_blank"&gt; just generally stay alive.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"This allows us to get a really accurate measure of how many calories people burn per day over the course of about a week," Pontzer says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When they adjusted for body size, Pontzer and his colleagues found that people from populations with higher obesity rates burned only slightly less total energy per day than those from populations that weighed less. These differences in energy expenditure didn't contribute much to the differences in obesity rates among populations, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While it may seem implausible that someone who is out foraging for berries all day burns about the same amount of daily calories as, say, your typical office worker, Pontzer says it fits with what scientists have been learning about how our bodies burn calories. Pontzer's past research has suggested that our bodies tend to adjust how we expend energy to keep our total calorie burn stable within a pretty narrow range.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"So if we burn more of our energy every day on physical activity, on exercise, after a while our bodies will adjust and spend less energy on the other tasks that we sort of don't notice going on in the background," Pontzer says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing the message on obesity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The new findings have big implications for obesity. If differences in calorie burn can't explain why some countries have higher obesity rates than others, then it must be something else. "And that would be diet," says Tobias, who praised the design of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's 100% the diet," agrees &lt;a href="https://facultyprofiles.tufts.edu/dariush-mozaffarian" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian,&lt;/a&gt; director of the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. "And I think then the question is, what is it about the diet?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mozaffarian was not involved in the study, but he says it adds to other recent research that suggests food is the biggest driver in obesity. He points out there's been a major shift in our food supply in recent decades — which is now dominated by&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/25/1178163270/ultra-processed-foods-health-risk-weight-gain" target="_blank"&gt; ultra-processed food.&lt;/a&gt; In a subanalysis of the data for some of the populations, Pontzer and his colleagues found that people in countries that got more of their calories from ultra-processed foods tended to have more obesity and higher body fat percentages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For decades we've been telling Americans that you're lazy, it's your fault, you're not moving enough, you're eating too much," Mozaffarian says. "And I think what this study shows is that there's really complicated biology happening and that our food is driving this."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, this doesn't mean there's no &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5323814/exercise-colon-cancer-longevity" target="_blank"&gt;reason to exercise.&lt;/a&gt; After all, it's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/09/19/1200223456/depression-anxiety-prevention-mental-health-healthy-habits" target="_blank"&gt;good for our mental &lt;/a&gt;and&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/14/nx-s1-5108843/exercise-fat-healthy-weight-obesity" target="_blank"&gt; physical health &lt;/a&gt;in so many ways that have nothing to do with weight.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt; But it does mean we can't outrun a bad diet. Pontzer says if we want to tackle obesity, the public health message should focus on changing what's on our plates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The last thing Chevese Turner needed was medication to help her lose weight. Twenty years into recovery from &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/binge-eating-disorder" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;binge eating disorder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/mental-health/eating-disorder-treatment" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;atypical anorexia&lt;/a&gt;, she was done trying to whittle her physique into something it didn't want to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after developing diabetes a few years ago, her doctor prescribed &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-weight-loss-meds-injections-compare-costs-results-side-effects" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt;, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (or GLP-1) that helps &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/what-is-diabetes" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;curb diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. A side effect of the medication? Weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that, Turner, who lives outside Washington, DC, hesitated. "I don't want to start getting into this mode where I'm like, 'Yay, I'm losing weight,'" said Turner, 57, the CEO of the Body Equity Alliance, an advocacy and coaching organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of her recovery from BED included learning to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/intuitive-eating" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;eat intuitively&lt;/a&gt; and letting her body tell her when it was hungry. Cautiously, she starting taking the drug. But, even at a low dose, Mounjaro eliminated her desire to eat, which caused her to drop pounds. This worried her.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                    Turner said her doctor told her not to worry about losing her appetite. That worried her.

          &lt;p&gt;"I still have a therapist and I do everything I can to make sure that I keep in strong recovery," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her endocrinologist, who had prescribed the medication, didn't understand her concerns. "She said, 'You don't have to eat lunch.' And I was like, 'No, I need to eat lunch and dinner and breakfast and snacks.' She just doesn't get eating disorders at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="d9d6f730-3299-463e-8186-7b4ba64b5e7d" data-toc-id="d9d6f730-3299-463e-8186-7b4ba64b5e7d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ozempic is hitting eating disorder centers hard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-may-2024-the-publics-use-and-views-of-glp-1-drugs/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;one in eight&lt;/a&gt; adults is currently taking a GLP-1, such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, designed for diabetes, and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eli-lilly-zepbound-ozempic-wegovy-novo-nordisk-weight-loss-drugs-2024-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Zepbound&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/quit-wegovy-ozempic-no-evidence-stop-taking-works-2023-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Wegovy&lt;/a&gt;, marketed for weight loss.

While originally intended for people with type 2 diabetes or chronic obesity, these drugs have been co-opted by those seeking weight loss — even if it's not medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that these medications can trigger new eating disorders, worsen existing ones, and complicate recovery. Brittany Lacour,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;national&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;director of clinical assessment intake at Eating Recovery Centers, with programs across the country, said the number of people who have come into ERC already on a GLP-1 went from 11 in 2023 to 31 in 2024. So far there have been 14 cases in 2025, including a 14-year-old child.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                    Dr. Elizabeth Wassenaar, regional medical director of Eating Recovery Center of the West, says more and more people with GLP-1 prescriptions are being admitted with eating disorders.

                  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;"We are seeing people who are coming into treatment with a relapse or new onset, and most of them are presenting with restrictive eating patterns, like anorexia," said Dr. Elizabeth Wassenaar, regional medical director of Eating Recovery Center of the West. She is also seeing an increase in atypical anorexia, a form of anorexia nervosa where someone is significantly restricting calories but is of average or above average weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Joel Jahraus, vice president of medical services at Monte Nido, a national eating disorder treatment provider, has seen a 25% to 33% increase in patients already on GLP-1 medications when they enter treatment. Most, if not all, of them have a binge-eating disorder. "A year ago there was no one presenting for an intake on a GLP-1 and then it increased to a couple a month going back 6 months," he said. These days, Monte Nido gets around three to five patients a month who are on a GLP-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, he notes, patients often hide their GLP-1 use from the person doing the intake, typically only bringing it up when they show up onsite for actual admission. Doctors attribute their reticence to shame, embarrassment, and the fear that their medications might be taken away from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The effect of these meds can go absolutely contrary to the goals of eating disorder treatment, so it's important to figure that out," Jahraus said. "If they are low body weight and have no other indication for use such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease, there is no place for the GLP-1 meds because the medication causes further weight loss. If they are normal or above normal body weight, we go through a process to gauge if they'll be successful at stopping their eating disorders, but that comes after treatment is initiated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4f038bc3-7d87-4c0f-b882-453715290178" data-toc-id="4f038bc3-7d87-4c0f-b882-453715290178"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'I'm not taking it for the right reasons, but I feel that I need to'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, Rose, 32, who lives outside Boise, Idaho, wrestled with restrictive eating and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/glennon-doyle-describes-identity-shift-from-anorexia-nervosa-diagnosis-2023-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;bulimia&lt;/a&gt;, cycling in and out of residential and non-residential treatment programs.

            &lt;/section&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;So when she was diagnosed with diabetes three years ago, she finally had a "legit" medical reason to ask her internist for a prescription for Ozempic. She was elated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her endocrinologist, dietician, and therapist were not. For people like Rose, with a history of restrictive eating, the inability to be in tune with their body could be disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Rose managed to persuade her internist to give her a prescription. He nervously agreed, but with strict conditions: she had to eat at least 1,500 calories a day, not exercise compulsively, and not lose more than two pounds a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As long as I was meeting those goals and all else was OK, I could stay on it," said Rose, who is currently on disability. (For privacy reasons, she requested anonymity.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within days of starting the drugs, which she injected into her abdomen, she noticed a shift. She needed less insulin, and sometimes didn't any. But more importantly, she no longer spent hours ruminating on food and weight. And her hunger disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It actually freaked me out," she said. "I wasn't intentionally restricting, but I had to force myself to remember to eat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her daily caloric intake plummeted to about 850 calories and then 350, which she tracked with MyFitnessPal. She did an hour of cardio every day and regularly took laxatives and diuretics, all of which she hid from her team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because, of course, she&lt;em&gt; liked&lt;/em&gt; the weight loss. She couldn't help herself. As she put it, "I know I'm not taking it for the right reasons, but I still feel that I need to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;es-blockquote data-quote="Routine screening for eating disorders risk does not occur in many medical settings, including those where GLP-1 drugs are prescribed" data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-source="Dr. Doreen Marshall"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote-wrapper pullquote-breakout"&gt;&lt;q class="pullquote-quotation heading-md"&gt;Routine screening for eating disorders risk does not occur in many medical settings, including those where GLP-1 drugs are prescribed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;cite class="pullquote-source label-md"&gt;Dr. Doreen Marshall&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/es-blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent report in Annals of Internal Medicine, in 2022 and 2023 about 24,500 emergency room visits were linked to semaglutide, Ozempic's active ingredient, primarily due to severe &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ozempic-stomach-paralysis-woman-says-weight-loss-drug-made-life-hell-2023-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;gastrointestinal side effects&lt;/a&gt; like nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, a Louisiana woman sued Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the makers of Ozempic and Mounjaro, for not disclosing the risk of serious gastrointestinal issues caused by the drugs. (The case is still pending.) As of May 1, there have been 1,809 lawsuits pending against the makers of GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone who stops taking the medications regains about two-thirds or more of the weight they lost on it — a widely accepted statistic that can make it hard for someone with an eating disorder to quit the drugs. But there are no studies on the long-term impacts of these drugs on health.&lt;/p&gt;

"People are often surprised to learn that routine screening for eating disorders risk does not occur in many medical settings, including those where GLP-1 drugs are prescribed," said Dr. Doreen Marshall, CEO of the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA). Many general medical practitioners receive limited or no training or education on eating disorders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially true when it comes to patients in larger bodies, who might suffer from BED or atypical anorexia. Many doctors see a heavier patient and assume they simply need to lose weight, but that's not always true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're prescribing for higher-weight people what we diagnose as eating disorders in thin people," said Deb Burgard, a psychologist and eating disorders specialist, and one of the founders of the Health at Every Size framework of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The breathless hype about a drug that aims to starve people is that it starves people seemingly without a protest from the starving body," Burgard added. "From our bodies' point of view, starvation is a disaster, no matter the source."&lt;/p&gt;

Her diabetes is under control, and that's important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she remains vigilant so she doesn't fall back into her old habits. She began setting a timer to remember when to eat, which she had done in the early stages of her recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had worked so hard for a long time to become an intuitive eater and my whole self has changed because I'm in recovery and I eat intuitively," she said. "It's just a totally different relationship with food and body. So I had to start going back to the very beginning of what I did in my recovery, and that was set timers to remember to eat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;es-blockquote data-quote="They would be devastated if they knew why I'm really taking it" data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-source="Rose, who asked a relative to get her Ozempic, saying it was for diabetes"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote-wrapper pullquote-breakout"&gt;&lt;q class="pullquote-quotation heading-md"&gt;They would be devastated if they knew why I'm really taking it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;cite class="pullquote-source label-md"&gt;Rose, who asked a relative to get her Ozempic, saying it was for diabetes&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/es-blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Rose, she has lost about 45 pounds since starting Ozempic. After her insurance stopped covering it, she began paying $1,000 a month out of pocket for a similar drug, Rybelsus, that a family member — believing she wanted it for her diabetes — helped her procure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They would be devastated if they knew why I'm really taking it," she said. She has had regular appointments with her endocrinologist, but never discussed her GLP-1 use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid May, she ran out of Rybelsus and didn't refill it; it was too expensive. Around this same time she landed in the hospital with low potassium, which doctors blamed on her overuse of diuretics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she had her way, she'd go back on Ozempic to lose another 45 pounds. She's thinking about buying some online, which won't require a doctor's prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is dangerous in its own right, as unregulated or unlicensed vendors have been &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scientist-cheaper-ozempic-sold-online-contains-dangerous-ingredients-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;selling fake Ozempic online&lt;/a&gt; or in medical spas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2024, the World Health Organization warned about falsified batches of Ozempic; the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy identified thousands of websites illegally selling fraudulent weight-loss drugs. Worldwide, 42 people were hospitalized after taking fake injections, according to the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System. Some people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rose knows she's playing with fire. Still, she isn't ready to give up the drug. "I feel like I'm doing better than I have in a while, but the thoughts of wanting to lose weight or take Ozempic don't ever go away."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;However, what is interesting, says Kelly, is that: “All these disorders that we write about, the literature now is leaning towards them all having inflammation as a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The immune system is likely not working right in some people. And that leads to inflammatory markers and inflammation. My suggestion is that to some people, gluten is one of the culprits in this immune inflammatory reaction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms Kelly sees among her psychiatric patients are brain fog, anxiety or depressive symptoms. “They sometimes have headaches and migraines. Joint pain is common too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coeliac disease and NCGS diagnoses are more common in individuals with ADHD symptoms than in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between coeliac disease and depression is well-established. One large study of over 2,000 people with coeliac disease showed a 39 per cent lifetime prevalence of depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One theory is that depression stems from the difficulty of living with a chronic illness,” says Kelly. “But there are &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/6/1894"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; showing a more direct physiological link between coeliac disease and depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is even clearer clinical data that those with schizophrenia can be helped by following a gluten-free diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One patient of Kelly’s suffering from schizophrenia always saw her illness worsen after having gluten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She was doing well in the community but when she had gluten she would be hospitalised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When she got into the hospital they would give her gluten because they wouldn’t believe the family that that mattered. Each time the family would have to fight about it at every hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other proteins are also linked to inflammation of the brain. “Casein from milk is another protein that is highly immunogenic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The role of ultra-processed foods (UPFs)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of the gluten realm there’s a movement towards understanding the impact of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/ultra-processed-foods/"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s evidence to show that depression and anxiety and most &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/the-american-beige-diet-thats-making-us-all-sick/"&gt;mental health conditions are higher in people who eat high levels of UPFs&lt;/a&gt;, especially in the western diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And wheat is part of that. Wheat is now the most widely cultivated crop in the world, and it supplies 20 per cent of all food calories and protein consumed by the global population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The data is showing us that there are more people sensitive to gluten than before, we think that’s due to a higher gluten content in UPFs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why gluten may now cause a more severe immune response is that there has been a six-fold increase in the gliadin content of wheat over time. This may be down to the use of high-nitrogen fertilisers and how wheat is processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The antibodies show the way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One young woman who came to Kelly suffering from anxiety and brain fog had previously been tested for gluten sensitivity by her gastroenterologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She was told she didn’t have coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity. So I brought her in to take part in my study, and sure enough her antibody response was the biggest I’d ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I actually found antibodies to suggest coeliac disease, which are called TTG. I gave her the paperwork and said, ‘please go back to your doctor’. When she went back, they did a biopsy and they found she had coeliac disease. It had been missed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is one of almost a thousand people in the general population that Kelly has tested for gluten antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When people have these antibodies, once I say, ‘You’re positive for this, it &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/gluten-free-diet/"&gt;might be worth trying a gluten free diet&lt;/a&gt;’, most people report their joint pain went away, or their brain fog, or their anxiety and depression improved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has published 24 peer reviewed studies around these antibodies and the relationship of gluten to neurological and psychiatric illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thirty per cent of my patients with schizophrenia have antibodies to gliadin. That means their body is having an immune response to wheat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Should you change your diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her work has changed her diet. Kelly now eats a low carb, almost gluten free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/tried-20-fad-diets-how-lost-five-stone/"&gt;fad diet&lt;/a&gt; person,” she says. “If you’d told me I would be studying this I would have laughed. But science took me there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From looking at animal studies, the data would suggest that gluten could be bad for everyone. “We haven’t gone so far as to say that,” says Kelly, cautiously. “But when you start to dig into it, and you’ve seen what a brain looks like of an animal of gluten, it really makes me think twice about how much should be in my diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, not everybody should be on a gluten-free diet. About 10 per cent of the population have NCGS. And Kelly sees lots of people who have no immune response at all. “Their bodies handle it fine. But then there are lots of people who have the antibodies and coeliac in their families and that’s where removal could really help people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s not going to be a cure all for everybody, typically Kelly sees changes in her patients in as little as three weeks. Brain imaging data has also shown how the blood flow in their brain improves on a gluten-free diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do recommend talking to your dietitian or doctor beforehand. That’s because many foods that contain gluten are fortified with minerals and vitamins that our body needs, but struggles to get from our diet. Things like folic acid. You need folate for your brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also notes that for those who have a psychiatric disorder, such as depression or schizophrenia, eating a gluten-free diet can be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once you are sick, it’s easier to just continue to eat gluten because it’s cheap and you don’t have to spend time cooking. When you’re not feeling well you don’t want to spend time cooking fresh vegetables. It becomes a cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Food as medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 2,000 years ago Hippocrates said, “let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All this time later we are now starting to pay attention to the impact of the food we put in our body,” says Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parents of one young man with a seizure disorder noticed that every time he had a big spaghetti meal his seizures were worse. “And no one thought that that was related,” says Kelly, who was consulted by a neurologist on the case. “While he didn’t test positive for coeliac disease, he did have antibodies to gliadin. And so we suggested a gluten free diet and he has been seizure free since.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is challenging for people to understand that a gluten-free diet helps their brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is used to resistance to new ideas, that is the lot of the scientist. However she says: “We now have the technology. We can look at brain imaging and antibodies and show that it actually connects. We know for a fact that the brain is impacted by what we put into our gut and now we have to unravel all the mysteries there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get Your Brain Off Grain: How a gluten-free diet could improve your mental and neurological health by Jessica A.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supplements may seem like an easy way to support brain function, but they’re not always safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians advise against taking supplements like vitamins E and B6 when supporting brain health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead, experts suggest adopting lifestyle habits like getting enough sleep and regular exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protecting and supporting your brain health is one of the smartest investments you can make for your overall well-being. Our brains are responsible for everything from memory and focus to emotional resilience and problem-solving. “Brain health means supporting the structure and function of your brain so it can perform at its best, both now and in the long run,” says &lt;a href="https://nomadistanutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mascha Davis, M.P.H., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s about &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-8786846" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protecting cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;, memory, mood, focus and mental clarity. Just like we care for our heart or gut, taking care of the brain is key for daily performance and long-term health.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While lifestyle choices like proper nutrition, sleep, exercise and stress management are vital, there’s often a temptation to reach for supplements that promise to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-in-the-morning-for-better-cognitive-function-11689092" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;boost brainpower&lt;/a&gt;. However, not all supplements are created equal, and some could do more harm than good. Below, we’ll explore five supplements to avoid for better brain health and provide alternative strategies to support your cognitive vitality effectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-vitamin-e"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Vitamin E &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin E is often touted as a brain booster due to its &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant properties&lt;/a&gt;, which can protect cells from oxidative stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, expert opinions reveal that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053927/these-supplements-can-be-toxic-if-you-take-too-much/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-dose vitamin E supplements&lt;/a&gt; may cause more harm than good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “High-dose vitamin E supplements are not recommended for better brain health,” explains &lt;a href="http://drlisayoung.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lisa Young, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “While vitamin E does have antioxidant properties, taking it in large amounts hasn’t been shown to improve memory or cognitive function in healthy individuals and may actually pose risks. Too much can interfere with blood clotting and may even increase the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke-11698358" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;risk of certain types of stroke&lt;/a&gt;,” Young adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of supplements, it’s safer to get vitamin E through food sources. A &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nuts-and-seeds-ranked-by-protein-11758822" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diet that includes nuts, seeds and leafy greens&lt;/a&gt; not only provides vitamin E but also ensures it’s absorbed in a way that complements your body’s natural processes without creating a risk of overdose.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-high-dose-vitamin-b6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; High-Dose Vitamin B6 &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin B6 is crucial for brain function because it supports the production of neurotransmitters, which help regulate your mood and cognitive performance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, like vitamin E, more isn’t always better.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Omega-6 fatty acids are essential fats that our bodies need, but an imbalance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids may contribute to inflammation, which can negatively impact brain health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many diets already contain more omega-6 than recommended, primarily from ultra-processed foods and vegetable oils. Taking omega-6 supplements may worsen this imbalance, especially if you aren’t balancing your intake with ample omega-3 fatty acids. This can potentially fuel brain-related inflammation. Instead, increase your intake of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; like salmon, walnuts and flaxseed, which can help restore the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-when-you-wake-up-if-you-have-chronic-inflammation-8789044" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, thereby supporting brain health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond avoiding harmful supplements, there are several natural ways to boost brain health. Here are a few simple strategies:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly:&lt;/strong&gt; Movement &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-buy-every-week-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke-11749988" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stimulates blood flow to the brain&lt;/a&gt; and promotes the release of chemicals that support memory and learning. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Adults need seven to nine hours of quality sleep per night. Sleep plays a vital role in memory consolidation and emotional regulation, so don’t skimp on shut-eye. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a brain-friendly diet:&lt;/strong&gt; Focus on whole foods, including healthy fats, lean protein and plenty of fruits and vegetables. The MIND diet, rich in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, is particularly beneficial for cognitive health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress effectively:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic stress can impair memory and decision-making. Incorporate &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-relieve-stress-in-10-minutes-8739935" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;stress-reducing practices&lt;/a&gt; like mindfulness meditation, journaling or spending time in nature into your daily routine. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay socially connected:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintaining strong relationships stimulates your brain and supports emotional well-being, whether it’s through group activities or simply spending time with loved ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

While supplements might seem like an easy way to “boost” brain function, not all of them are effective or safe. High doses of vitamins E and B6, as well as ginkgo biloba, caffeine supplements and omega-6, can be more harmful than helpful. Instead, focus on obtaining nutrients through a balanced diet and adopting &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8055902/healthy-habits-to-help-you-live-longer/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy lifestyle habits&lt;/a&gt; like regular exercise, quality sleep and stress management. And if you plan to take supplements, be sure to get the green light from your health care provider first. 
&lt;/p&gt;

In a world filled with social media, video calls, and instant messages, loneliness is quietly becoming a major health crisis. A new report from the World Health Organization (WHO) reveals a shocking truth: loneliness is now linked to over 871,000 deaths every year. It’s not just about feeling sad or isolated; it’s harming our bodies and minds. From heart problems to depression, the effects are real. As this silent epidemic grows, it’s time we take loneliness seriously and start rebuilding the human connections we all need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Loneliness is becoming a global health crisis despite digital connection&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an era where we are constantly plugged into digital networks, sending texts, reacting with emojis, and hopping on video calls, a silent epidemic is claiming lives at an alarming rate. A new report by the World Health Organization (WHO), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/978240112360?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;From Loneliness to Social Connection: Charting the Path to Healthier Societies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, reveals a disturbing global paradox: despite unprecedented connectivity, loneliness is emerging as one of the most pressing public health threats of our time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the report, over 871,000 people die each year due to the direct and indirect effects of loneliness. That’s more than 100 people every hour, a figure that rivals the global death tolls from major diseases such as heart conditions and diabetes. Far from being a fleeting emotional state, loneliness is now recognised as a risk factor for serious health issues, both physical and mental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What loneliness really means and why it affects our health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO defines loneliness as the gap between the relationships people have and the ones they desire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not merely the state of being alone but the painful feeling of being emotionally or socially disconnected. Social isolation, the objective lack of social contact, is closely related, and both conditions can lead to devastating consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mounting research links loneliness to an array of health problems, including stroke, heart disease, dementia, depression, anxiety, diabetes, and even premature death. The report underscores that strong social connections act as a “biological buffer,” reducing inflammation, regulating stress hormones, improving mental well-being, and potentially extending life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The hidden social and economic causes behind the loneliness epidemic&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the global reach of smartphones and social media, our digital lives often lack depth. Likes, comments, and brief messages may create an illusion of interaction, but they rarely substitute for the meaningful relationships that humans truly need. As Chido Mpemba, co-chair of the WHO Commission on Social Connection, points out, even young people immersed in digital environments often report feeling profoundly alone. But screen time isn’t the sole culprit. The loneliness crisis is deeply rooted in a complex web of socioeconomic and cultural factors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor health and disability can restrict social participation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Economic hardship leads to stress and fewer social opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Urbanisation and sprawling cities have diminished traditional community spaces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A culture of hyper-independence often prizes productivity over personal connection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lack of accessible education and shared social infrastructure can further isolate individuals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these factors contribute to a world where forming and maintaining deep social bonds is becoming increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the WHO wants loneliness treated as a public health priority&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tackle this crisis, the WHO urges governments and institutions to recognise loneliness not as a personal failing but as a systemic health issue. The report outlines a multifaceted approach to addressing the problem, calling for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policy changes that promote community engagement and inclusive urban planning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investment in research to better understand loneliness and how to combat it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New ways to measure social connection and isolation, allowing for better monitoring and targeted interventions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Public campaigns that encourage acts of connection, such as initiating conversations with strangers or joining local groups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, the WHO stresses that social connection should be treated as a core component of public health, just as vital as access to clean water, nutrition, or vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to rebuild human connection and overcome loneliness in today’s fragmented world&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loneliness epidemic is not an inevitable consequence of modern life but a result of systems and priorities that undervalue human connection. While there’s no quick fix, even small, intentional acts, like a shared meal, a walk with a friend, or a supportive workplace, can begin to restore a sense of belonging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If societies fail to act, loneliness will continue to erode not only individual health but also the social fabric that binds communities together. The time to treat connection as essential to well-being is now because, in the end, our lives may depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/cant-sleep-new-research-shows-ancient-indian-and-chinese-exercises-enhance-sleep-quality/articleshow/122860807.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Can’t sleep?

In the run-up to the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, a brand of pedometer was launched called the manpo-kei, which translates as "10,000-step meter".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Ding says this figure was "taken out of context" and became an unofficial guideline, which many fitness trackers and apps continue to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Lancet study analysed previous research and data on the health and activity of more than 160,000 adults around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Compared with those who walked 2,000 steps a day, it found that 7,000 steps was linked to reduced risk of: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 fusmZA"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;cardiovascular disease - down 25%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;cancer - down 6%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;dementia - down 38% &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;and depression - down 22%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, the researchers say some figures could be less accurate than others as they are drawn from only a small number of studies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Overall, their review suggests even modest step counts of around 4,000 steps a day are linked to better health compared to very low activity of just 2,000 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For most health conditions, the benefits tended to level off beyond 7,000 steps although there were additional advantages to walking further for the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f9f0/live/f5ed1d80-67e3-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A person is holding a smartphone displaying a fitness tracking app while wearing white headphones and a smartwatch." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Counting daily steps has become a popular pastime with fitness trackers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Most exercise guidelines focus on time spent doing physical activity over step counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For example, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/behealthy/physical-activity" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; says adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity every week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Ding says this advice can sometimes be difficult for people to understand but the current guidelines still serve an important purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There are people who swim, cycle, or have physical disabilities that don't allow them to take steps," she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But she says a recommendation on the number of steps people should take could be included as an "addition" that would "prompt people to think about spreading their physical activities throughout the day". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Daniel Bailey, a sedentary behaviour and health expert from Brunel University London, says the study challenges the "myth" that 10,000 steps a day is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While 10,000 steps is a suitable goal for those who are more active, he says aiming for 5,000 to 7,000 could be a "more realistic and achievable target" for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Andrew Scott, senior lecturer in clinical exercise physiology at the University of Portsmouth, agrees the exact number isn't important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He says "more is always better" and people shouldn't worry too much about hitting a specific target, especially on days when activity is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 03:27:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1pMVA0RzYwekdRbi1YSW9USEV6VFNyVEVrdGgya2Jkc1pkdm9FRWNUbk1SWkhEMXZBc2xHT3JZejZ4N0xjQ1FVNS1xWURWTXBxdU42WE8ta1QzQdIBX0FVX3lxTE43Q05lRUxVZ0cyaXhjWHZoMTRBMURDb1BvWG9EeUVNemN6Z0YxdTI1YmNNUTVCcUxXdmVzTDZmdXhCZk41ZC1xdFNMLUl3bW9VbmtHQmM3TE43Z3N0Mkhj</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家恳求人们尽快停止做这件事，以帮助预防血栓- AOL.com | Cardiologists Are Begging People To Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP To Help Prevent Blood Clots - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE1JN2lrMEp1X3FuSTJ1MVFZNUUtNXdMeUZXMnBrdndvdHEyM2Fla3l2VmpZcm1Ja09VaVlkaTI1cGV3Ql83ajB6Y1lBcHNLd0Y5YUdHejJxZ3Y5eWZ3Nkd2RnZDb0pPc0xsMnA1WEQtTC1UQnRfRXhIeWljQzhGb3M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/habit-to-quit-for-blood-clot-prevention-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cardiologists Are Begging People To Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP To Help Prevent Blood Clots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cardiologists Are Begging People To Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP To Help Prevent Blood Clots &lt;/a&gt;

For most people, the thought of getting a blood clot is scary (understandable!), so wanting to prevent them is of top priority. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Believe it or not, blood clots—as scary as they sound—are a normal part of your body's process. Blood clots are gel-like masses that form when blood solidifies from a liquid state. The problem—and life-threatening part—arises when blood clots abnormally within vessels, or break loose and travel to other parts of the body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ahead, we spoke with cardiologists to find out what you can do to prevent these abnormal blood clots, plus other ways to keep your body as healthy as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/stethoscope" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩺;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🩺&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/pill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:💊;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💊&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The One Thing Cardiologists Say To Stop Doing To Help Prevent Blood Clots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.daniellebelardomd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Danielle Belardo, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Danielle Belardo, MD, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a preventative cardiologist based in Los Angeles, says you should try to stop being inactive and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/minimum-exercise-needed-week-according-to-new-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:add more exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;add more exercise&lt;/a&gt; into your routine in a way that is safe and healthy for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maintaining a &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1305490/emilyshiffer/healthy-lifestyle-and-dementia/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; helps to keep your blood flowing and, in turn, reduce the risk of clots," Dr. Belardo says.

This is particularly important if you have a sedentary job or find yourself on a long flight and you aren't up and moving. For example, Dr. Kowey recommends &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-to-never-do-after-long-flight-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walking around the cabin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walking around the cabin&lt;/a&gt; every couple of hours during a long flight to keep the blood moving if you're able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you're not flying, it's important to find ways to incorporate movement and exercise into your routine in a way that is feasible and doable for you. For example, for some people that may involve taking the stairs over the elevator or &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/how-to-make-walks-more-effective" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:going on walks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;going on walks&lt;/a&gt; with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Kowey, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/simple-hydration-trick" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:staying well hydrated, especially in hot weather,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;staying well hydrated, especially in hot weather,&lt;/a&gt; is important to prevent increased blood viscosity that can increase the chances of a clot. You'll want to check with your doctor to see how much water you need to be drinking per day and make sure you're drinking enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/food/i-am-cardiologist-this-is-what-i-add-to-almost-every-meal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I’m a Cardiologist, and This Is the One Thing I Add to Almost Every Meal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;I’m a Cardiologist, and This Is the One Thing I Add to Almost Every Meal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Understand your risk factors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with many health conditions, it's important to understand your risk factors.

It’s quick, easy and a great way to get a clearer picture of where you stand in terms of your overall heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While screening tests can be helpful, you'll want to talk to your doctor about your specific medical circumstances and history to get a better idea of how you can take the best care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-heart-condition-sign-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Heart Trouble;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Heart Trouble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;See a doctor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When in doubt, it's always best to consult with your doctor about &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-does-a-blood-clot-feel-like" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood clots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood clots&lt;/a&gt; and any other medical concerns you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are simple, non-invasive tests to diagnose a deep venous or arterial clot and good medication to treat the problem safely," Dr. Kowey explains.

Nutrients such as sugar and fat trigger signals that travel from the digestive tract to nerve centers in a flash, guiding everything from cravings to satiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the thought that the brain might also monitor the trillions of microbes living in the colon sounded almost science fiction – until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New evidence shows that chemical chatter from resident bacteria can hit the nervous system in real time, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drugs-targeting-gut-cells-not-brain-cells-are-better-at-treating-depression-and-anxiety/"&gt;shaping behaviors&lt;/a&gt;, such as how much we eat, within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings sketch out a neurobiotic “sixth sense” that sits alongside taste and smell, one that keeps tabs on microscopic neighbors before they cause trouble or waste precious calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-brain-monitors-the-gut"&gt;How the brain monitors the gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most gut microbes cluster in the colon, where they break down leftovers and spin out vitamins that our bodies cannot make on their own. While they work, they shed fragments of protein that swirl through the intestinal stew. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most common of these bits is flagellin, the building block of the spinning tails many bacteria use for propulsion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/flagellin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Flagellin&lt;/a&gt; has long been known to trip immune alarms, but the speed of immune responses is measured in hours, not seconds. A faster line of communication had to exist if the brain were to react during a meal rather than after it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href="https://medschool.duke.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Duke University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; have now traced such a line to neuropod cells – rare sensory cells embedded in the colon’s lining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fewer than one in a thousand epithelial cells qualifies as a neuropod, yet those spies plug directly into fibers of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/vagus-nerve-stimulation-offers-new-hope-for-severe-depression/"&gt;vagus nerve&lt;/a&gt;, the major information highway connecting gut and brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tiny-sensors-with-big-influence"&gt;Tiny sensors with big influence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/publication/1450088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuropod cells&lt;/a&gt; in the small intestine are already famous for tasting nutrients. The new work shows that their cousins in the colon carry a receptor named Toll-like receptor 5 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor_5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TLR5&lt;/a&gt;), best known from immune cells that watch for bacterial flagellin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When flagellin docks on TLR5, the neuropod releases peptide YY (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/peptide-yy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PYY&lt;/a&gt;), a hormone that presses the brakes on appetite, and fires an electrical burst into the vagus nerve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In laboratory dishes, roughly one-quarter of isolated neuropods erupted with calcium sparks – an unmistakable sign of activation – within seconds of flagellin appearing. Block TLR5 and the flashes vanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were curious whether the body could sense microbial patterns in real time and not just as an immune or inflammatory response, but as a neural response that guides behavior in real time,” said Bohórquez, a professor of medicine and neurobiology at Duke University School of Medicine and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-flagellin-and-the-vagus-nerve"&gt;Flagellin and the vagus nerve&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see whether this microscopic relay mattered in a living animal, the scientists threaded a hair-thin tube into the colons of mice and dripped in purified flagellin. Within moments, electrodes on the neck picked up a surge of activity in the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-does-gut-brain-communication-affect-emotional-well-being/"&gt;vagus nerve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice, which had fasted overnight, hesitated before taking their first bite and ate noticeably less during the next hour. The effect faded after about three hours – just long enough for the gut to clear its latest load of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the same experiment was run on mice genetically engineered to lack TLR5 only in neuropod cells, the nerve stayed quiet and the animals &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-do-some-foods-seem-irresistible-the-answer-is-in-your-gut/"&gt;kept eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, these mice gained weight even though their hormones, blood sugar, and gut inflammation stayed normal. Removing a single receptor from a tiny population of cells had quietly lifted a brake on food intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dissecting-the-gut-brain-pathway"&gt;Dissecting the gut-brain pathway&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The steps in the circuit line up like dominoes: flagellin binds TLR5 on a neuropod cell, the cell releases PYY, PYY hits Y2 receptors on nearby vagus endings, and the electrical pulse races to appetite centers in the brainstem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interfering at any point – blocking TLR5, preventing PYY release, or silencing Y2 receptors – cuts the signal. The speed of the response, measured in fractions of a second, sets it apart from hormonal cues such as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/humans-and-dogs-share-genes-linked-to-obesity/"&gt;leptin or ghrelin&lt;/a&gt;, which rise and fall over hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By responding swiftly, the gut can keep a running tally of microbial activity and adjust intake before the next mouthful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking ahead, I think this work will be especially helpful for the broader scientific community to explain how our behavior is influenced by microbes,” said Bohórquez. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One clear next step is to investigate how specific diets change the microbial landscape in the gut. That could be a key piece of the puzzle in conditions like obesity or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-microbes-have-an-unexpected-link-to-anxiety/"&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-neuropods-flagellin-and-appetite"&gt;Neuropods, flagellin, and appetite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery slots gut bacteria alongside nutrients, stretch receptors, and hormones as direct contributors to appetite control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the neuropod pathway works locally in the colon and talks to the brain through existing nerves, it might one day be targeted without systemic side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugs that mimic flagellin’s signal, or dietary tweaks that favor bacteria whose flagellins hit TLR5 hardest, could help curb overeating in a more natural-feeling way than current appetite suppressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging hints suggest the circuit may also converse with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trusting-your-gut-instinct-can-make-you-happier/"&gt;emotional centers&lt;/a&gt;. The vagus nerve reaches brain regions involved in mood, and PYY has been linked to feelings of calm after meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If microbial flagellin can influence those areas too, the microbiome might steer not only how much we eat but how we feel while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-we-learn-less-we-know"&gt;More we learn, less we know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used flagellin from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/salmonella-typhimurium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a species better known for food poisoning than for friendly gut housekeeping. Harmless commensal bacteria sport subtly different flagellins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do those variations tweak the neuropod response, dialing appetite up or down depending on which microbes dominate? And does the brain treat all flagellins as the same “slow down” cue, or can it distinguish between benign tourists and rowdy invaders?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answering those questions will require tools that can swap microbial strains on demand and sensors that report neuropod activity in real animals during normal meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As those tools come online, scientists expect to map a fuller picture of how bacterial voices blend with nutritional signals to fine-tune eating behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, gut bacteria can tap a lightning-fast nerve circuit that tells the brain to put the fork down by flashing a protein badge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery places neuropod cells at the heart of a freshly recognized “neurobiotic sense,” one that keeps the peace between host and microbes meal after meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09301-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 01:26:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNWU5rd3RfSzRtYmxKay03enRVdXhtTGhJdzdRX0RuSGJ6WEFNWklSclJ2Zm4yeGtwam9xWkxORWxDZXRscUZFY1gydk5JU3BURlNQSmlHMkJaVHBNSkx5X2hrZmZoeGEzaXFLS0Q5aFo0bFpSTjhINWZlUWJadXlBVUJyMFRFUUZjMmNNWUZCTGpJOHV0Q3RyTktrNk9XN3pwQmxqRUQ2YV9Wc2dlZ0M3RG1aWFY3Yl9k</guid></item><item><title>牙医正在分享他们可以通过观察患者的口腔内部来告诉患者的所有信息，并且反应令人惊讶- BuzzFeed | Dentists Are Sharing All The Things They Can Tell About A Patient Just By Looking Inside Their Mouth And The Responses Are Surprising - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxNSVVrMVV3Ry0tSjRkeWotWEVRTUl5RU9mMWdnYUlzQ3VzMFA0Z1d1WHV3d2p4Ui11ZE15QnVFZmxhRERpQmZzc3hkQVVFbEtqUjYtVTRTQ2JMNkdZOW0xZDRmdHdXcjZ6aGhvMUU1Z0VVbDdqZjhtSW1UaVRqOTFkNElpSFlPZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;When you go to the dentist, you’re likely focused on matters like cavities and gum health. But dental experts can detect a lot more from your exam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot about someone’s overall health can be observed just by looking in their mouth,” &lt;a href="https://drkamihoss.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7912617" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Kami Hoss&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist and author of &lt;em&gt;If Your Mouth Could Talk&lt;/em&gt;, told HuffPost. “In fact, over 100 systemic conditions and many medications can have oral manifestations. This means that what happens in the mouth can often be a window into broader health issues, helping to identify problems before they escalate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the mouth is considered the “gateway” to the body, it can also be the origin of problems in many different bodily systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mouth’s microbes “can enter the bloodstream through bleeding gums or open root canals and travel to other parts of the body, causing infections or inflammation,” Hoss noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why routine dental checkups are so important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A comprehensive oral examination can provide valuable insights into a person’s overall health and lifestyle habits, helping dental professionals identify potential issues and provide appropriate care and recommendations,” said cosmetic dentist &lt;a href="https://mymanhattancosmeticdentist.com/about/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7912617" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Michael J. Wei&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what exactly can a dentist infer about you from the state of your mouth? We asked some professionals to share what they’ve seen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You Floss Regularly... Or Rarely&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nighttime routines like limiting alcohol and salty snacks can help support healthy blood pressure levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Key habits include taking medications, practicing mindfulness, and creating a restful sleep environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small bedtime changes can boost heart health and complement diet and exercise for better blood pressure control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Maintaining healthy blood pressure is about more than keeping your doctor happy at your checkup. It is a key part of reducing your risk of heart disease, stroke and other serious health issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When thinking about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lower-blood-pressure-8611460" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ways to support healthy blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, a heart-healthy diet and exercise may come to mind, which isn’t wrong. But it’s not just about what you do by day. Your nighttime routine plays a bigger role in your heart health than you might think.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s right! Getting ready for bed might feel like an ordinary part of your day, but did you know certain bedtime steps may be powerful medicine for better blood pressure? We spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.conehealth.com/find-a-doctor/doctor-profile/mary-branch/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mary Branch, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist at Cone Health in Greensboro, North Carolina, about how to make the most of those precious pre-sleep moments to support healthy blood pressure. And trust us, it’s easier than you’d expect (no burpees required!). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before you hit the pillow tonight, try these five simple yet effective tips to give your blood pressure a little extra love.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-limit-alcohol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Limit Alcohol  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For some people, unwinding at the end of the day might include sipping on a boozy nightcap. However, if you have high blood pressure, cutting back on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-and-your-health-11685623" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;alcohol &lt;/a&gt;is especially important, says Branch. “For women, it is recommended to drink no more than one drink per day, and two for men,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While alcohol may feel relaxing in the moment, it can actually make it harder to manage your blood pressure over time. Even small amounts can interfere with medications or put additional strain on your heart and blood vessels. And the more you drink, the higher your blood pressure rises. The link is so strong that one study found that each additional daily drink a person had significantly increased their systolic and diastolic blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news? By swapping that nightcap for something like herbal tea, such as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8067374/chamomile-tea-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chamomile tea&lt;/a&gt;, or simply sticking to water, you’re doing your body a huge favor. In addition to helping promote more stable blood pressure, you’ll give your body a hydration boost, too. Just go for caffeine-free beverage options, as caffeine may make it hard to sleep. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-remember-your-medication"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Remember Your Medication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you’re prescribed medications to treat hypertension, it is recommended that you take these medications each day,” says Branch. This includes medications you may need to take before bed. Yes, even on nights when you feel too tired to open a pill bottle. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adhering to prescribed hypertension medications is crucial for effectively managing blood pressure and reducing the risk of serious health complications, such as heart attacks and strokes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Consistency is key, as these medications work best when maintained at steady levels in your system. Skipping a dose can disrupt this balance and potentially hinder progress. Incorporating daily reminders, such as setting an alarm or using a pill organizer, can help ensure you take your medications on time. Simple steps like keeping your medications within reach, like near your bedside or in a spot you frequent, can make it easier to stay on track—even on those long days when opening a pill bottle feels like a chore.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-practice-mindfulness"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Practice Mindfulness &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Branch suggests that practicing meditation and mindfulness may be a helpful bedtime habit for healthy blood pressure. “This can help bring down your stress level and your blood pressure along with it,” she says. “Furthermore, it can help you with getting a good night’s rest, which is also important for reducing blood pressure.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientific data supports these recommendations. Research highlights the link between &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8051058/does-stress-cause-high-blood-pressure/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress and higher blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, illustrating the importance of addressing stress for overall health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By taking small but intentional steps toward relaxation before bed, you can set yourself up for restful sleep and a healthier tomorrow. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some additional ways to manage stress before bed include practicing yoga or gentle stretching to ease muscle tension, journaling to clear your mind, and creating a calming bedtime environment by reducing noise and dimming lights.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Establishing a consistent bedtime routine can further signal to your body that it’s time to wind down, creating a seamless transition to restful sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-avoid-high-sodium-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Avoid High-Sodium Snacks  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Late-night snacking can be tempting. But if you’re aiming to support healthy blood pressure, it’s crucial to steer clear of high-sodium foods before bed. Consuming salty snacks like chips, canned soups or pretzels may cause your body to retain water. This can increase the pressure on your blood vessels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, keeping your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/thing-to-avoid-if-you-have-high-blood-pressure-8700143" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sodium &lt;/a&gt;intake in check, especially before sleep, may help stabilize your blood pressure overnight and promote better overall cardiovascular health. Opt for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/low-sodium-snacks-dietitians-love-8775716" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;low-sodium snacks &lt;/a&gt;like fresh fruit, unsalted nuts or air-popped popcorn. They’ll satisfy your evening cravings without compromising your blood pressure. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-keep-your-bedroom-cool-dark-and-comfortable"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Keep Your Bedroom Cool, Dark and Comfortable  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Creating the right sleep environment can have a surprising impact on healthy blood pressure levels. A cool, dark, comfortable bedroom not only promotes better sleep but also may support heart health by encouraging quality sleep. Conversely, data suggests that poor sleep can lead to elevated blood pressure over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To keep your bedroom comfortable, ensure your room is dark, quiet and cool.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eliminating distractions such as bright lights or loud noises and investing in a supportive mattress and pillow may also encourage deeper, more restorative sleep. These small adjustments may help your body relax and recover from the day, contributing to better blood pressure regulation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Certain healthy bedtime habits can have a significant impact on your blood pressure. And developing these habits doesn’t have to feel overwhelming or complicated. Simple strategies like limiting alcohol, taking your blood pressure medication, practicing mindfulness, avoiding high-sodium snacks and creating a comfortable sleep environment can all help promote better blood pressure. In addition to tried-and-true methods for supporting blood pressure, like exercise and a healthy diet, these easy, proactive steps can help lower blood pressure and improve heart health. Remember, the path to better well-being often starts with small, intentional changes. By prioritizing these pre-sleep practices, you’ll not only support your blood pressure but also enhance your overall quality of life, one restful night at a time.&lt;br&gt;

A Riverside man in his forties fatally overdosed on the substance in March but the cause was not officially determined until this month, the Riverside University Health System said in a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ruhealth.org/news/public-health-officials-confirm-first-fatal-carfentanil-overdose-riverside-county-resident#" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;news release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illegally manufactured fentanyl drugs  such as carfentanil entered illicit markets in the northeast U.S. as a substitute for white-powder heroin in 2013, the CDC said in a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7348a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Carfentanil, which is 10,000 times more potent than morphine, can be lethal at a fraction of the two milligram range for fentanyl, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every life lost from opioids is one too many,” Riverside County Public Health Officer Dr. Jennifer Chevinsky said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases of carfentanil overdoses are rare, but on the rise, the release said. U.S. deaths involving carfentanil increased from 29 in the first half of 2023 to 238 during the same period last year, according to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carfentanil is defined as a unique illegally manufactured fentanyl, an opioid produced without the regulations of pharmaceutical-grade fentanyl. That means it can go undetected by some fentanyl test strips, which can lead to an increase in accidental overdoses, health officials added. While overall opioid overdoses have decreased both nationally and in Riverside County, according to the release, the CDC said that the reemergence of carfentanil “may threaten this progress.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together, we can continue to raise awareness about the risks associated with drug use and work as a community to support safety, reduce harm and care for one another,” Chevinsky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Riverside University Health System recommended that individuals carry naloxone to treat someone overdosing on fentanyl and avoid using carfentanil even in small doses due to the unpredictability and potency of the substance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 00:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1wFBVV95cUxNbjMzeVZGN2w1Y1JlSmlzMTR1Q0d6bG85aWJCYWlzMkEzeHNrS0dHNWRhZi1sb0pFVEo3YVRpNFNWdG5KdHQ5Z20zQ3RnNTlwUlRKQm5oMzBXejZzeUd0MHozQ1hrLVBaSkNyN0Z6em53cDF3TjAtUDhoOUNlZ0oxcFZqRVNMN2FScU1IamJzSm1neFBLaUoyNDJHa3Vod3dxUFFlRmw3S2lZY0piaUJnWFZfMFZPVWNtNmlZcEhOQWVFanZiUS1KYVo5MWd2ZWw1Yk5qaVFhOA</guid></item><item><title>引导纳米颗粒重新连接脑细胞，提高对帕金森治疗的希望- ScienceAlert | Guided Nanoparticles Reconnect Brain Cells, Raising Hopes For Parkinson's Treatment - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxNUWMwdUNXemVqYXRLY3ZoZklmTHl6bFdQQkZKbnB4YmFWdkdBZHB2bzFueTAtNVk2YXJqeDlZeWNvYU85MENYREJHRHlvQ21OZ0c3TEtyU3dkc3hnLUdiQWczRDlCQm96ZUxlQlhHYUhidFBmTERUN3AxbzhEVzRnRVFYZnRXRmdmdy0wc2RTNVlRUTQ5WUVNeVg3MUxlN1hPVlNwZjFsYU9zQk8yVnI4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Broken connections between brain cells play a critical role in &lt;/span&gt;multiple neurodegenerative conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-"&gt;including Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists have now come up with a novel way of repairing our neural wiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team led by University of Pisa biologist Sara De Vincentiis &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-grew-mini-brains-from-stem-cells-then-the-brains-sort-of-developed-eyes"&gt;used mini-brains&lt;/a&gt; grown in a lab to test a technique they're calling "nano-pulling", using tiny magnetic particles controlled by magnetic fields to guide axons (connective nerve fibers) into place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With further development, the researchers believe this approach could help restore the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigrostriatal_pathway"&gt;nigrostriatal pathway&lt;/a&gt;, a vital connection in motor control that is compromised in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="168125" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study demonstrates the potential of nano-pulling as an emerging technique to promote directed reinnervation within the central nervous system," &lt;span&gt;the researchers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202500400"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-could-have-an-fda-approved-treatment-already?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Parkinson's Discovery Suggests We Could Have an FDA-Approved Treatment Already&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease is partially the result of damage to brain cells that make the chemical messenger dopamine. Transplanting dopamine-producing tissue has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(12)70295-8"&gt;shown some promise&lt;/a&gt; as a therapy, but these new cells struggle to hook themselves up to host brain tissue once they're in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some gentle coaxing with magnetic particles could help fix that problem, and get us another step closer to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-could-already-have-an-fda-approved-treatment"&gt;effective treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168128" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168128" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/NeuronImagery.jpg" alt="Mini-brain images" class="wp-image-168128 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/NeuronImagery.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/NeuronImagery-600x303.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168128" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mini-brains were used to test the effects of nano-pulling. (De Vincentiis et al., &lt;em&gt;Adv. Sci&lt;/em&gt;., 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nano-pulling was shown to increase axon length and get connectors moving in the right direction. It also made the cells more stable, and produced more of the axon branches and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_vesicle"&gt;synaptic vesicles&lt;/a&gt; (tiny packages of neurotransmitters) that are required to build neuron links and eventually restore the nigrostriatal pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, the magnetic particles used in the experiment have been approved safe for use in medical procedures, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="168125" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scans. No damage was seen in the mini-brains used by the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We successfully achieved guided neurite growth, resulting in increased neurite length and branching, thereby reinforcing the versatility and potential therapeutic applications of this technique," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202500400"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no cure yet for Parkinson's disease, but we're getting better at understanding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-might-not-start-in-the-brain-study-finds"&gt;how it gets started&lt;/a&gt; and the different risk factors involved. Like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="168125" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, it's a complex disease, and it can be difficult to distinguish between causes and the consequences of having it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work continues to find treatments that can stop Parkinson's or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-is-the-first-time-drug-shows-signs-of-slowing-parkinsons-disease"&gt;slow it down&lt;/a&gt;. As with this latest study, a lot of the focus is on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-drug-may-prevent-cognitive-decline-in-parkinsons-disease"&gt;protecting the brain&lt;/a&gt; from damage, and trying to get dopamine production &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nanoparticles-reverse-parkinsons-in-mice-by-healing-damaged-dopamine-cells"&gt;back up and running&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Parkinson's disease is the second most frequent age-related neurodegenerative disease globally," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202500400"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Parkinson's disease prevalence has doubled over the past 25 years, with an alarming rise to 13 million patients &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JPD-181474"&gt;projected by 2040&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202500400"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The mosquito-borne illness &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/eastern-equine-encephalitis/about/index.html"&gt;eastern equine encephalitis&lt;/a&gt; has been detected in Massachusetts for the first time this year, state health officials announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus was detected in a mosquito sample collected on July 21 in Belchertown, the Department of Public Health &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-public-health-officials-announce-seasons-first-eee-positive-mosquito-sample" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein said the positive test is a reminder for residents to take measures to protect themselves from mosquito bites this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is around the time we would expect to find EEE in mosquitoes in Massachusetts, especially after an active EEE season last year with four recorded human cases,” Goldstein said. “This is only a first finding and mosquito surveillance will be key to tracking any developing areas of increasing risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EEE is a rare but serious and potentially fatal infection that has no cure. The virus is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can trigger brain swelling, fever, and coma, and it &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2019/08/26/massachusetts-eee-death"&gt;kills approximately a third of the people who contract it&lt;/a&gt;. Survivors can face severe neurological disabilities and complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/09/09/4th-human-case-of-eee-detected-in-mass/"&gt;four human cases&lt;/a&gt; of EEE in Mass last year and one person died. Four horses were also infected last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the state, no human or animal cases have been detected in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“EEE activity in Massachusetts tends to occur in outbreak cycles,” State epidemiologist Catherine Brown said in a statement. “When EEE is found in mosquitoes at this point in the season, the risk may increase throughout the rest of the summer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials are urging residents to take precautions, like using insect repellent and covering up bare skin, to prevent bites. Residents can also drain standing water around their properties and install or repair screens to help reduce the risk of bites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The peak biting time for mosquitoes is dusk to dawn, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during the evening or early morning in areas of high risk,” officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents can check the state’s map that &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-arbovirus-update"&gt;tracks the risk&lt;/a&gt; for mosquito-borne illnesses in Massachusetts to determine the risk for EEE in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

It was also associated with a 25% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a 47% reduction in overall risk of dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although step count does not measure the quality or intensity of exercise, the findings underscore the importance of being active. There is a “return on investment” with every additional 1,000 steps taken and even 4,000 steps per day reduced the risk of disease, compared with very low activity levels, the researchers observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although the risk continues to decrease above 7,000 steps, the rate at which it reduces that risk starts to slow. Melody Ding, professor of public health at the University of Sydney and lead author of the research, said that those who already walked 10,000 steps should not go back to 7,000, but that 7,000 was a more practical target for those who were currently inactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Those who are currently active and achieving the 10,000 steps a day, keep up the good work – there is no need to modify your step counts. However, for those of us who are far from achieving the 10,000 targets, getting to 7,000 steps/day offers almost comparable health benefits for the outcomes we examined.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Responding to the findings, Dr Daniel Bailey, reader in sedentary behaviour and health at Brunel University of London, said the research helped&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;”debunk the myth that 10,000 steps per day should be the target for optimal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The real-world implications are that people can get health benefits just from small increases in physical activity, such as doing an extra 1,000 steps per day. To achieve the best reductions in risk, aiming for 5,000-7,000 per day can be recommended, which will be more achievable for many people than the unofficial target of 10,000 steps that has been around for many years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Andrew Scott, senior lecturer in clinical exercise physiology at the University of Portsmouth, pointed out that not all activity was captured by step counts. “The steps per day is useful when people’s exercise is weight-bearing, however cycling, swimming and rowing are not well-represented by the steps-per-day model.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;June Davison, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: “We know that regular walking is one of the easiest ways to help maintain a healthy lifestyle and reduce your risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Adults should aim to build up to a total of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity every week, but getting active isn’t always easy. Incorporating activity snacks, such as walking while taking phone calls, or taking a brisk 10-minute walk during your lunch break, can all count to reduce your chances of developing heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxORjB5WjkteWZ1NjVQTnA1ai1nVUgzVWpXNUQ5d3dXQ0k5X1FmVVNpdV9qaFdoU0lOQVU4bVZyZ05vcVFGVEFsdUFPeUd3OVJTNlI0LU9lUWhOMldidUZhYWxLaG5vaWpvc1V1aHZnS2lTVEhSYjdUekpERmZNaUZyTHE4aGlrMGtvaEEybGpKZTg2Z2pGTlJrNjBLdENzQ0NWcGJkdUExWURLS2ctQ3ZWTEdrN1c</guid></item></channel></rss>
