In a chocolate tasting study, participants from higher socio-economic backgrounds showed stronger alignment between their internal hunger signals and food intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds did not show the same physiological regulation, despite similar levels of consumption. This study suggests that bodily signals for hunger and satiety may function differently depending on socio-economic conditions, providing insight into health disparities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vagal Tone Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher vagal activity predicted eating behavior only in participants from wealthier backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weaker Regulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Internal signals of hunger and fullness were less predictive in participants from lower socio-economic groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; These differences may contribute to dietary inequalities and long-term health disparities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Durham University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Food Quality and Preference&lt;/em&gt;, the research highlights how physiological signals, particularly those transmitted via the vagus nerve, interact with socio-economic factors to shape dietary behaviour. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 96 students from diverse socio-economic backgrounds who participated in a chocolate tasting session.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108855"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows people eating." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While the research focused specifically on chocolate consumption as a model for eating behaviour, the implications may extend to other types of food and dietary patterns. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a controlled laboratory setting, each participant was presented with a plate containing 70 milk chocolate pieces and invited to sample and rate them at their leisure.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers measured each student’s heart rate variability (HRV) as a proxy for the activity of the vagus nerve – a part of the nervous system that regulates appetite and digestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s lead author, Professor Mario Weick of Durham University’s Department of Psychology, explained: “The findings suggest that while the vagus nerve plays a key role in transmitting signals between the gut and the brain, the extent to which these signals guide eating behaviour can vary with one’s socio-economic status.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research indicates that internal signals may be more closely aligned with eating behaviour in individuals from higher socio-economic backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In contrast, those from lower socio-economic groups appear to show a weaker link between these physiological signals and their food consumption.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research builds on longstanding theories regarding the impact of socio-economic factors on health and dietary habits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, disparities in diet have been attributed to differences in food access and external factors.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this study shifts the focus towards internal regulatory processes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data revealed that participants from more advantaged backgrounds consumed more or less chocolate depending on their vagal tone, which can signal both hunger and satiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, in individuals from less advantaged backgrounds, this physiological regulation was not as evident.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Milica Vasiljevic of Durham University, the study’s co-author added: “Our study does not support the idea that individuals from lower socio-economic groups eat more or are inherently more impulsive.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather, it highlights that the internal regulation of eating – how our bodies naturally signal when to eat and when to stop – may function differently depending on our socio-economic backgrounds.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could have important implications for understanding broader health inequalities.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the research focused specifically on chocolate consumption as a model for eating behaviour, the implications may extend to other types of food and dietary patterns.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research is needed to explore whether similar patterns are observed across different populations and with other food categories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work marks a significant step forward in disentangling the complex relationship between socio-economic status, physiological regulation, and dietary habits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By bringing attention to the role of internal bodily signals in shaping eating behaviour, the research offers new perspectives for developing public health strategies that address dietary inequalities and associated long-term health outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and neuroscience

consumption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socio-economic status (SES) correlates with patterns of food consumption, yet the underlying physiological mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examines how SES modulates the relationship between vagal tone, a physiological marker of self-regulation, and chocolate consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different hypotheses about how SES may be linked to vagal regulation of chocolate consumption were put to a test in a laboratory study with a socio-economically diverse group of students (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 96).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vagal tone was assessed using an index of heart rate variability (HRV–HF) measured at rest (baseline) and during acute stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants’ chocolate consumption was measured using a bogus taste test. The results showed that socio-economic status interacted with vagal tone to influence chocolate consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings for both subjective and objective indicators of SES converged in showing that vagal tone predicted chocolate consumption among higher SES participants, with higher vagal tone associated with lower chocolate consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No such relationship was found in lower SES participants, suggesting a dissociation between vagal regulation and eating behaviour in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the importance of considering autonomic regulation in understanding socio-economic disparities in dietary behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:23:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5tSzJURDNna2hYaXVUYUhIbWFSQVQ5N2hEZDRuaHoxNTZJRVNTZ01mTDR6WXFITnRYWnJ4TktwdzVncnhkNnBibE5oZlZKUk9DY1lLWlBkVThUXzUzM3lwOXppYUg5a0RDRVc0MGNteUJ1bHB5</guid></item><item><title>推动这三只股票的血液测试革命-投资者商业日报 | The Blood Test Revolution Driving These Three Stocks - Investor's Business Daily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxQNV85TU1MbHhTX0xsQTFsUVJlQTUtVjJGQ3JET3YwcEpDYjY0NG01enJWSE52T1JtZDZ6UkdJZWtCWmNrUFEyRTE4R2FsZUd6ckJVbmtvZkcwTnRlRUl0NktEOHQ3aklCUFFrM2ZHVDFxSWozbVM1SjdBbTRmYXpKbXd3TUNzSTRuYWE4Q1pZN3g5ZEJKM3lGUW40RHVCUktETW5jNlIwZGptY29QVGdMWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single-post-content post-content drop-cap crawler"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer rates are on the rise, particularly in young people. And when it comes to cancer, it's a no brainer that the earlier a patient undergoes treatment the better the chance they have of surviving. Guardant, Natera and Exact are blazing trails in the use of blood tests to detect cancer relapses months sooner than traditional technology. They do this by looking for tumor DNA in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a low level of tumor DNA in the blood is dangerous, says Richard Chen, chief medical officer for &lt;strong&gt;Personalis&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSNL" target="_blank"&gt;PSNL&lt;/a&gt;), a small biotech company that sells a minimal residual disease, or MRD, test called NeXT Personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It means that the cancer is there, it's festering and there's a good chance it's going to expand and recur for the patient," he told Investor's Business Daily. "Yes, I think it is a five-alarm fire in the sense that if you don't do anything about it and leave it alone, (immune system) surveillance is not necessarily going to take care of it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market is &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/27/3002196/28124/en/Minimal-Residual-Disease-Testing-Market-Growth-Trends-2025-2031-Growing-Use-of-MRD-Testing-In-Cases-of-Solid-Tumors.html#:~:text=The%20minimal%20residual%20disease%20testing,crucial%20for%20cancer%2Daffected%20patients." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;massive and growing&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://bisresearch.com/industry-report/mrd-testing-market.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;MRD test market&lt;/a&gt; could be worth between $4.45 billion and $6.7 billion in the early 2030s, according to market estimates. That's up from $2.2 billion in 2023, according to &lt;a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/minimal-residual-disease-testing-market-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Grand View Research&lt;/a&gt;. What's driving the opportunity? A sharp increase in the number of cancer diagnoses and, in turn, survivors. By 2040, the National Cancer Institute expects there will be 26 million &lt;a href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/ocs/statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cancer survivors in the U.S&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Massive Market For Guardant Health, Rivals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer emerges from cellular mutations. MRD tests seek to find those mutations as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a patient is diagnosed with cancer, the most common route is to attack it with surgery. Guardant Health, Exact Sciences and Natera can run that sample through their systems and come up with a set of mutations — or biomarkers — consistent with that cancer, but not the patient's own DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardant sells Reveal, while Natera has its Signatera test. Exact is angling to launch its rival, Oncodetect, in the second quarter. These blood tests screen for a small handful of cancers today. But the companies are vying to prove their merit in a growing number of cancers. Notably, fellow biotech company &lt;strong&gt;Veracyte&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VCYT" target="_blank"&gt;VCYT&lt;/a&gt;) is planning to launch an MRD test for muscle-invasive bladder cancer in the first half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, doctors &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/guardant-health-stock-medicare-reveal-coverage-blood-test/?_gl=1*15xsk4r*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjIwMjYxODgwMzYuMTczOTU1NjU5Ny4xNzM5NTU2NTk2*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MDYwNzk1Mi42OS4xLjE3NDA2MDk0NzQuMzAuMC4w"&gt;monitor for cancer recurrence&lt;/a&gt; through a variety of imaging tests. If a patient had breast cancer, they might undergo routine mammograms. Lung cancer patients will often receive semi-regular CT scans to look for new tumors. Other patients might undergo PET scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you're in remission from your cancer, obviously the No. 1 concern that you have is your cancer is going to come back," Mike Brophy, chief financial officer of Natera, told IBD. "There's already a whole architecture of care for you to monitor that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But cancer can be unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The majority of breast cancer survivors who've had their cancer return, it's not going to return to the breast," Brophy said. "It's probably going to return to the liver or the lungs. And you're not going to catch that if you're doing radiology — an image of the breast."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Months Of Lead Time For Blood Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the cancer type, blood tests can detect a relapse an average of 15 months before imagining scans, &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/guardant-health-stock-guardant-health-earnings-q3-2024/?_gl=1*1qcdl0z*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjIwMjYxODgwMzYuMTczOTU1NjU5Ny4xNzM5NTU2NTk2*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MDYwNzk1Mi42OS4xLjE3NDA2MDk0ODEuMjMuMC4w"&gt;Guardant Health&lt;/a&gt; Chief Executive Helmy Eltoukhy told IBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardant's Reveal detects minimal residual disease associated with early-stage colorectal, breast and lung cancers. This group accounts for 40% of all cancer survivors, Eltoukhy estimates. Medicare pays for the cost of colon cancer monitoring. Guardant is working to receive reimbursement for breast and lung cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to data released in late 2023, Guardant Reveal has detected a breast cancer relapse up to 28.6 months before it would show up with imaging, but with a median lead time of 7.9 months. The latter time also detected a relapse with high specificity, meaning it's more likely to rule out patients who don't have cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natera's Brophy says Signatera can detect recurrent cancer around nine months before standard scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NeXT from Personalis has a six- to 11-month lead time in early-stage lung cancer and can detect breast cancer relapse a median of 15 months ahead of traditional imaging. Chen, the company's CMO, describes NeXT as an ultrasensitive test. That means it's 10 to 100 times more sensitive, analytically, than the first generation of blood tests from companies like Guardant Health and Natera, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study called Alpha-Correct, &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/exact-sciences-stock-exact-sciences-earnings-q3-2024/?_gl=1*1qcdl0z*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjIwMjYxODgwMzYuMTczOTU1NjU5Ny4xNzM5NTU2NTk2*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MDYwNzk1Mi42OS4xLjE3NDA2MDk0ODEuMjMuMC4w"&gt;Exact Sciences&lt;/a&gt; followed colorectal cancer patients for five years. Oncodetect was able to detect cancer recurrence about 10.4 months earlier than imaging, Chief Science Officer Jorge Garces told IBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That is critical," he said. "Weeks and months are critical in terms of being able to manage the disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Escalating Or De-Escalating?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But relapse monitoring isn't the only use for MRD testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These blood tests can also determine the success of a surgery and how to proceed from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a patient is recovering from surgery at home, companies like Guardant Health and Natera build their bespoke test. Then, after a month or so, patients get a blood draw. That blood carries the answer to the most common question for cancer patients following surgery: Did they get it all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take colorectal cancer. Roughly two-thirds of patients undergo surgery and that's it. They're cured. The remaining third have micro metastases — meaning the cancer has spread to other areas of the body. But the tumors aren't visible yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Postsurgery, both the two-thirds of people who are cured by surgery and the one-third that need to follow up with chemo, they present the same way," &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/stock-market-ibd-50-stocks-3/?_gl=1*h8k09b*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjIwMjYxODgwMzYuMTczOTU1NjU5Ny4xNzM5NTU2NTk2*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MDYwNzk1Mi42OS4xLjE3NDA2MDk1NzIuOS4wLjA."&gt;Natera&lt;/a&gt;'s Brophy said. "It's hard to tell who is who, even though doctors and patients know full well a ton of people are going to get the chemo and don't need it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a better-safe-than-sorry mentality. But these blood tests could change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natera has published data comparing patients who received chemotherapy after having their tumor surgically removed. Those who tested positive for circulating tumor DNA had a statistically significant benefit from chemo. Those who tested negative experienced no benefits from chemo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy is expensive and often causes painful side effects, Brophy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now, you have this ability to triage these patients after surgery to see who really needs chemotherapy and who doesn't," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MRD Testing Takes On Pseudo-Progression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third use case is in monitoring patients who are actively receiving treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some patients don't automatically undergo surgery. In breast cancer, for example, somewhere around half of patients first receive progressive rounds of chemotherapy in the hopes of shrinking the tumor. This will eventually allow them to receive a lumpectomy instead of a full mastectomy — removing a lump is generally preferable to removing the entire breast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to imaging, cancer often responds to aggressive treatment by appearing bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon is called pseudo-progression. The tumor isn't getting bigger because the cancer is worsening, says Personalis' Chen. It's enlarging because immune cells are going into the tumor to fight it. This is often the case when patients receive immuno-oncology drugs that help uncover camouflaged cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The blood-based tests don't have that issue," Susan Tousi, chief executive of DELFI Diagnostics, said in an interview. DELFI makes blood tests that screen people for cancer, a space closely tied to MRD testing. "I think there are some benefits that allow for earlier detection and more robust detection of treatment response."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenges Ahead For Guardant, Natera, Exact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/biotech-stocks-rhythm-pharmaceuticals-rytm-ibd-50/?_gl=1*9cw1r1*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjIwMjYxODgwMzYuMTczOTU1NjU5Ny4xNzM5NTU2NTk2*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MDYwNzk1Mi42OS4xLjE3NDA2MDk1NjMuMTguMC4w"&gt;challenges facing Guardant Health&lt;/a&gt;, Exact Sciences and Natera, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it already hasn't been easy for the trio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardant stock had an impressive run from October to January, surging almost 105%. Since then, shares have pulled back somewhat. They're still nowhere near their record high above 181 in early 2021. But Guardant stock has climbed more than 32% this year, as of the close on Wednesday, outperforming Investor's Business Daily's Medical-Services industry group, which has risen a more moderate 2.6%. The group ranks ninth out of 197 groups IBD tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardant Health shares rank No. 21 on the &lt;a href="https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/"&gt;IBD 50&lt;/a&gt; list of elite growth stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natera belongs to the Medical-Research Equipment/Services industry group. Veracyte ranks first, leading Natera as the second top seed. Natera shares mostly fell from late 2021 to early 2022. But shares more than quadrupled through January of this year. On a year-to-date basis, Natera shares have fallen more than 5%. The industry group, which ranks a poor No. 167, has tumbled a more precipitous 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exact Sciences stock has mostly fallen over the last few years, peaking in January 2021 above 159. Today, shares of the MRD testing company trade around 42. Exact shares dropped dramatically last November after the company missed third-quarter sales expectations and enacted an "alarming" &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/exact-sciences-stock-exact-sciences-earnings-q3-2024/?_gl=1*1jph11e*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjQzNjYyMDQxOS4xNzQwNjc3MTgxLjE3NDA2NzcxODE.*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MTE5MzUyMS45NS4xLjE3NDExOTYzNzEuNDcuMC4w"&gt;guidance cut&lt;/a&gt;. This January, shares took a hit on competitive concerns facing its &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/exact-sciences-stock-cologuard-guardant-health-natera/"&gt;stool-based colorectal cancer test&lt;/a&gt;, Cologuard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that all three companies work in tangential testing markets. Guardant is well known for its Shield test, which uses blood to screen for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic people. Exact sells Cologuard and a multicancer early detect test called CancerGuard. Natera has numerous tests for cancer, women's health and organ health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, none of these companies are profitable — which isn't exactly a rarity for companies in the biopharma space. But it's also not preferable for savvy investors. According to FactSet, analysts don't expect Exact Sciences to notch its first profits until 2026. Natera is expected to follow in 2027. But analysts don't expect earnings, on a strict, as-reported basis, for Guardant until 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Targeting New Cancer Types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardant Health estimates 12 million cancer survivors are more than five years out from their surgery. About 3 million of them don't have tissue samples available on which to build a personalized blood test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason, Natera just announced its new tissue-free MRD test. This test would scan for common mutations found in specific cancer types. So, it's not bespoke to a patient's individual cancer. The idea is to help patients who had surgery long ago, or those who can't undergo surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's less exact than Signatera, Natera's Brophy said. The tissue-free blood test catches about 86% of the cancers that Signatera finds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other challenges include tumors that don't spill as much DNA into the bloodstream. Lung cancer has been a difficult target. These tumors are known as low-shedders. There are also cancers that have fewer mutations. Personalis' Chen says this is where the ultrasensitive approach pays off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NeXT screens for up to 1,800 mutations associated with cancer, compared with first-generation blood tests which look for 16 to 50 mutations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Eltoukhy, Guardant Health's CEO, says the technology is only getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"As the technology gets more sensitive, you get better at all of them," he said. "You'll get really, really good at the high-shedding ones and, then, better at the low-shedding ones. You'll still have that differential, but you'll get better at all of them over time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Growing Market For Blood Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a huge market for blood tests to monitor for cancer relapse, says Eltoukhy. Though there are tools in place to monitor cancer survivors, it can be tricky to navigate the Byzantine health care system for which tool to use and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are some diseases where they may scan every six months, every three months in the first year, first two years. Others where it may be annual. It's been a sort of mishmash of different available tools, whatever seems to work best for that specific cancer type," he said. "But the follow-on hasn't been, I would say, as set in stone and standardized as maybe treatment guidelines are for metastatic patients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should take into account the newness of the technology, combined with the growing rates of cancer diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's huge and growing," Personalis' Chen said of the MRD testing market. "I think we're only scratching the surface. It's still early days for MRD. It's a new technology. People are still getting used to what it can do."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfiam1001m3b73hsbgavyo@published"&gt;My daughters, ages 2 and 3, generally get along. They have similar interests, and both have a sense of humor. However when it comes to sharing, whether it’s me, a prized toy, or a spot at the sink to wash their hands, it often quickly turns into the 2-year-old hitting or pulling hair in an attempt to get her way. As you can imagine, this causes the 3-year-old to start screaming, then her sister starts screaming, then the 3-year-old starts crying, then they both are crying … you get the picture. The 3-year-old will hit back if I don’t get in there fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfiam1001n3b73vumldnrq@published"&gt;My question is: how do I intervene in a way that improves and supports their relationship? I always immediately pull the 2-year-old off of her sister and give the usual talk about how &lt;em&gt;hands are not for hitting and we don’t hit people&lt;/em&gt;, and of course check to make sure everyone is ok. I keep seeing parenting advice about not intervening every time your kids fight because it doesn’t give them an opportunity to learn how to problem solve. However, what do you do when almost every fight involves someone getting hurt?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfiam2001q3b73d74n5awu@published"&gt;You’re doing the right thing by intervening immediately when it comes to violence. Problem solving is one thing, but I’m not familiar with any parenting advice that suggests letting them slug it out. Personally, I stop behavior in kids if it would be considered illegal for adults to do. We’re not allowed to go around hitting people. They shouldn’t be either. That goes for verbal assault too! Of course, good luck explaining to a two-year-old that an adult would get arrested for doing what they’re doing. Still, it doesn’t hurt to mention it.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfiam2001r3b73gntkgqlz@published"&gt;My layperson-armchair-psychology take is that the two year old is hitting because they are younger and don’t feel like they have a non-violent way to assert themselves. She’s probably smaller and not as good with words yet. Work with her on other ways to assert herself without resorting to fisticuffs. The moment you intervene, ask her if she can think of another way to get what she wants without hitting. See if you can get her to explain what her intentions were. For example, “I hit because I wanted to play with the slinky.” Also try to get her sister involved in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfiam3001s3b73951rvsj5@published"&gt;Identify upcoming situations in which they’ll have to share as early as you can and prepare them for it. Before they even get to the sink, talk to them about how they’re going to use their &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; to determine who gets to use it first and how they’re going to tell the other one when they’re finished. When there’s something big they’ll both want, you can even practice ahead of time with each of them.&lt;/p&gt;

However, we are in our early 70s now and are beginning to tire of it.  At this point, my son and daughter have seven kids between them ranging in age from eight to eighteen months. It’s no longer as easy as when it was just them and their spouses and two or three kids along with my sister and her husband and son.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfp20t002k3b73lbd9iwjq@published"&gt;When I raised the topic with my daughter, she became angry. She accused me of “cancelling Easter at the last moment and ruining things for the kids” and said she and her brother were counting on us to make Easter happen for them like we always have because our backyard is the “best and safest” choice for the egg hunt. A conversation with my son went similarly sideways and I ended up caving and agreeing to host Easter this year.  Do my husband and I have an obligation to continue this tradition until our grandkids have outgrown it?&lt;/p&gt;

Your son and daughter overreacted to the idea of not having Easter at your house.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfp950002v3b73cj2yfpv5@published"&gt;But, I think that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; might stand to gain a lot by continuing to host—at least in some capacity. If possible, try to decelerate your involvement instead. Maybe this year you just do less. Let them use the yard, but have your son and daughter do all the work. They are young! Ask them to help prepare your house ahead of time and ask them to bring all the food and drinks. You can focus on your grandkids when they’re over, and then on cleaning up the house after they leave (or you can even ask your kids to hire a cleaner to do it for you).&lt;/p&gt;

If you label yourself unable to host and generally exhausted, you might not see your grandkids as much as you’d like. And, while you might get tired from hosting a bunch of grandchildren, remember that they’ll be forming lasting memories of you. Don’t take that away from them just because their parents are being ungrateful or lazy. Put more of the burden on the parents.&lt;/p&gt;

They have a big yard with lots of great egg-hiding places. My kids are old enough now to find egg hunts a little dull and my in-laws are in their late 70s, but we still keep the tradition alive and invite friends with younger kids over too. These days my wife and I pitch in and try to do everything we can ahead of time, planning for a few weeks up to the day. We potluck it so that my in-laws don’t have to cook if they don’t want to. We help set up and help tear down. We know that it’s something the kids have done their entire lives and will remember fondly when they’re grown up.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfp20u002q3b73dnmlbwtx@published"&gt;From a broader perspective, your kids’ overreaction to Easter does not bode well for the future. You need to prepare them for the idea of taking care of &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; instead of the other way around. Talk to them seriously about how as you age you’ll be able to handle less and less, but that your aging doesn’t mean you don’t want to see them—just that you’ll need more help. Look at Easter as an opportunity to practice coming to a compromise that works for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For six years, Ziska and a large team of research colleagues in China and the US grew rice in controlled fields, subjecting it to varying levels of carbon dioxide and temperature. They found that when both increased, in line with projections by climate scientists, the amount of arsenic and inorganic arsenic in rice grains also went up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arsenic is found naturally in some foods, including fish and shellfish, and in waters and soils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inorganic arsenic is found in industrial materials and gets into water—including water used to submerge rice paddies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rice is easily inundated with weeds and other crops, but it has one advantage: It grows well in water. So farmers germinate the seeds, and when the seedlings are ready, plant them in wet soil. They then flood their fields, which suppresses weeds, but allows the rice to flourish. Rice readily absorbs the water and everything in it—including arsenic, either naturally occurring or not. Most of the world’s rice is grown this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new research demonstrates that climate change will ramp up those levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What happens in rice, because of complex biogeochemical processes in the soil, when temperatures and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; go up, inorganic arsenic also does,” Ziska said. “And it’s this inorganic arsenic that poses the greatest health risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure to inorganic arsenic has been linked to cancers of the skin, bladder, and lung, heart disease, and neurological problems in infants. Research has found that in parts of the world with high consumption of rice, inorganic arsenic increases cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France’s national food safety authority has issued a stark recommendation that could impact menus across the country’s &lt;strong&gt;public institutions&lt;/strong&gt;. The Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l’alimentation, de l’environnement et du travail&lt;strong&gt; (Anses)&lt;/strong&gt; has raised concerns over the risks of excessive soy consumption, particularly in the context of mass catering services like &lt;strong&gt;school cafeterias&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;hospitals&lt;/strong&gt;, and nursing homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Soy Is Under Renewed Scrutiny&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soy-based products&lt;/strong&gt; like soy&lt;em&gt; milk&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; tofu&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;miso&lt;/em&gt; have become increasingly visible in Western diets. Long a staple in Asian cuisine, soy is especially popular among vegetarian and vegan consumers due to its high content of &lt;strong&gt;plant-based proteins&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But despite its popularity, soy is a controversial food. Its composition includes phytoestrogens, specifically &lt;strong&gt;isoflavones&lt;/strong&gt;, which are naturally occurring compounds known to have estrogen-like hormonal activity. According to Anses, high levels of isoflavones can have &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/nasas-worst-fear-martian-dust-is-way-deadlier-than-you-think/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="85206" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;toxic effects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on the reproductive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The agency has now formally recommended that soy products no longer be served in public catering facilities, regardless of age group. This measure, Anses states in its &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anses.fr/fr/content/eviter-les-isoflavones-dans-les-menus-des-restaurations-collectives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;March 24, 2025 publication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, aims to avoid overconsumption of foods rich in isoflavones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who Would Be Affected by the Guidance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recommendation would apply to a wide range of institutions. The list includes&lt;em&gt; day-care centers, preschools, primary and secondary schools,&lt;/em&gt; colleges, universities, hospitals, nursing homes, vacation centers, and &lt;strong&gt;prisons&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts cited in the report highlight that high soy intake may extend the length of &lt;strong&gt;menstrual cycles&lt;/strong&gt; in women and reduce testosterone levels in men, with potential negative effects on &lt;strong&gt;fertility&lt;/strong&gt;. In children, the concern is focused on the possibility of hormonal disruption during development due to prolonged exposure to isoflavones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Anses points out that isoflavones, although naturally found in many plants, are especially concentrated in soy—which remains the primary known source of these compounds in the human diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Soy Already Has Limited Use in Collective Catering&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the gravity of Anses’ warning, soy is not currently a major player in collective catering. The publication &lt;strong&gt;60 Millions de Consommateurs&lt;/strong&gt; recently reported that the Syndicat national de la restauration collective has responded to Anses, stating that crèches no longer use soy-based products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In school cafeterias, soy is already used in a very limited capacity. It is only included as part of the &lt;strong&gt;vegetarian menu experiment&lt;/strong&gt; outlined by the Conseil national de la restauration collective, which allows one soy-based meal for every five vegetarian meals served.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This limited frequency already reflects an effort to manage soy intake across age groups, but Anses is now recommending more decisive action to ensure population-wide protection from &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/11/5-signs-youre-eating-too-much-sugar/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="71991" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hormonal risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to Reduce Soy Exposure Without Cutting Plant Proteins&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anses emphasizes that it is entirely possible to reduce exposure to isoflavones while maintaining a &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/08/diet-changes-reduce-heart-kidney-disease/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="7330" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthy, plant-rich diet&lt;/a&gt;. One strategy is to diversify plant protein sources—for example, by replacing soy with &lt;strong&gt;legumes&lt;/strong&gt; such as lentils or beans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency also notes the importance of distinguishing between different soy-based products, as isoflavone levels vary widely. Some soy snacks, like &lt;strong&gt;soy-based crackers&lt;/strong&gt;, can contain 100 times more isoflavones than other products like soy sauce, which is typically fermented and used in small quantities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These insights suggest that consumers and institutions alike can reduce risk not only by lowering overall soy intake, but also by choosing products more carefully.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When activated by patterned infrared light, these nanoparticles stimulate retinal cells, bypassing damaged photoreceptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This activation leads to visual signal transmission to the brain, confirmed by activity in the visual cortex. Researchers envision a future device combining these nanoparticles with laser-equipped goggles to restore functional vision in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; Gold nanoparticles stimulate bipolar and ganglion cells using infrared light.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive Approach:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike electrode implants, nanoparticle delivery uses simple eye injections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restored Visual Signals:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain imaging confirmed visual cortex activation post-treatment in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Brown University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study by Brown University researchers suggests that gold nanoparticles — microscopic bits of gold thousands of times thinner than a human hair — might one day be used to help restore vision in people with macular degeneration and other retinal disorders. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/em&gt; and supported by the National Institutes of Health, the research team showed that nanoparticles injected into the retina can successfully stimulate the visual system and restore vision in mice with retinal disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108839"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Retinal disorders like macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa affect millions of people in the U.S. and around the world. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that a new type of visual prosthesis system in which nanoparticles, used in combination with a small laser device worn in a pair of glasses or goggles, might one day help people with retinal disorders to see again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a new type of retinal prosthesis that has the potential to restore vision lost to retinal degeneration without requiring any kind of complicated surgery or genetic modification,” said Jiarui Nie, a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institutes of Health who led the research while completing her Ph.D. at Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe this technique could potentially transform treatment paradigms for retinal degenerative conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nie performed the work while working in the lab of Jonghwan Lee, an associate professor in Brown’s School of Engineering and a faculty affiliate at Brown’s Carney Institute for Brain Science, who oversaw the work and served as the study’s senior author. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retinal disorders like macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa affect millions of people in the U.S. and around the world. These conditions damage light-sensitive cells in the retina called photoreceptors — the “rods” and “cones” that convert light into tiny electric pulses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those pulses stimulate other types of cells further up the visual chain called bipolar and ganglion cells, which process the photoreceptor signals and send them along to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new approach uses nanoparticles injected directly into the retina to bypass damaged photoreceptors. When infrared light is focused on the nanoparticles, they generate a tiny amount of heat that activates bipolar and ganglion cells in much the same way that photoreceptor pulses do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because disorders like macular degeneration affect mostly photoreceptors while leaving bipolar and ganglion cells intact, the strategy has the potential to restore lost vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new study, the research team tested the nanoparticle approach in mouse retinas and in living mice with retinal disorders. After injecting a liquid nanoparticle solution, the researchers used patterned near-infrared laser light to project shapes onto the retinas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a calcium signal to detect cellular activity, the team confirmed that the nanoparticles were exciting bipolar and ganglion cells in patterns matched the shapes projected by the laser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiments showed that neither the nanoparticle solution nor the laser stimulation caused detectable adverse side effects, as indicated by metabolic markers for inflammation and toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using probes, the researchers confirmed that laser stimulation of the nanoparticles caused increased activity in the visual cortices of the mice — an indication that previously absent visual signals were being transmitted and processed by the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, the researchers say, is a sign that vision had been at least partially restored, a good sign for potentially translating a similar technology to humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For human use, the researchers envision a system that combines the nanoparticles with a laser system mounted in a pair of glasses or goggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameras in the goggles would gather image data from the outside world and use it to drive the patterning of an infrared laser. The laser pulses would then stimulate the nanoparticles in people’s retinas, enabling them to see. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach is similar to one that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for human use a few years ago. The older approach combined a camera system with a small electrode array that was surgically implanted in the eye. The nanoparticle approach has several key advantages, according to Nie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, it’s far less invasive. As opposed to surgery, “an intravitreal injection is one of the simplest procedures in ophthalmology,” Nie said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are functional advantages as well. The resolution of the previous approach was limited by the size of the electrode array — about 60 square pixels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the nanoparticle solution covers the whole retina, the new approach could potentially cover someone’s full field of vision. And because the nanoparticles respond to near-infrared light as opposed to visual light, the system doesn’t necessarily interfere with any residual vision a person may retain.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More work needs to be done before the approach can be tried in a clinical setting, Nie said, but this early research suggests that it’s possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We showed that the nanoparticles can stay in the retina for months with no major toxicity,” Nie said of the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And we showed that they can successfully stimulate the visual system. That’s very encouraging for future applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health’s National Eye Institute (R01EY030569), the China Scholarship Council scholarship, the Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission scholarship, and South Korea’s Alchemist Project Program (RS-2024-00422269). Co-authors also include Professor Kyungsik Eom from Pusan National University, Brown Professor Tao Lui, as well as Brown students Hafithe M.

Lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic are all carcinogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Rubin first learned that lead was added to toothpaste about 12 years ago while working with families that had children with high levels of the metal in their blood. The common denominator among them was a brand of toothpaste, Earthpaste, that contained lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Last year she detected high levels in some toothpaste using an XRF lead detection tool. The levels were high enough to raise concern, and she crowdfunded with readers to send popular brands to an independent laboratory for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Among those found to contain the toxins were Crest, Sensodyne, Tom’s of Maine, Dr Bronner’s, Davids, Dr Jen and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So far, none of the companies Lead Safe Mama checked have said they will work to get lead out of their product, Rubin said. Several sent her cease-and-desist letters, which she said she ignored, but also &lt;a href="https://tamararubin.com/2025/02/just-ingredients-sends-lead-safe-mama-llc-a-cease-desist-letter-february-2025-read-the-full-letter-here-please-comment-with-your-reaction-below/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on her blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some companies have &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/leadsafemama/p/DGAjitsOemW/?img_index=1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;defended themselves&lt;/a&gt;, often &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/leadsafemama/p/DFb9gnEOD2P/?img_index=1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;claiming&lt;/a&gt; that lead &lt;a href="https://wellnesse.com/pages/wellnesse-toothpaste-rebuttal?srsltid=AfmBOopmOTTRa-FH1kxDxHwiCuLqulrWwyXbXUF0uK7bSxIdDZb4aPOz" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;is found&lt;/a&gt; in trace levels throughout the environment and is impossible to avoid. Others &lt;a href="https://tamararubin.com/2025/02/responses-from-toothpaste-companies/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;have said&lt;/a&gt; the levels Rubin found are not concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The federal Baby Food Safety Act of 2024, which is stalled in Congress, called for lead limits in kids’ food or personal care products like toothpaste of five parts per billion (ppb). California’s limit on lead in baby food is two ppb, but it does not include toothpaste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Most toothpastes exceeded those thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The FDA’s current lead limit for children is 10,000 ppb, and 20,000 ppb for adults. None exceeded the FDA limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The state of Washington recently enacted a law with 1,000 ppb limits – several exceeded that and have been reported, Rubin said, but companies have time to get in compliance with the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Crest’s parent company, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Rubin said the contamination seems to lie in some ingredients added to toothpaste, including hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate and bentonite clay. Hydroxyapatite is extracted from cow bone and added because it allegedly helps teeth absorb calcium, though Rubin said she doubts it does. Calcium carbonate is added to help remove stains from teeth. Bentonite clay is a cleaning agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Those with the highest levels all had bentonite clay. Meanwhile, Rubin’s testing of hydroxyapatite and calcium carbonate as individual ingredients showed concerning levels of lead and other metals, suggesting those are the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Several children’s toothpastes, like Dr Brown’s Baby Toothpaste, did not test positive for any metals and did not contain the ingredients in question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPSmdaSnZOTFY0UTFpZG8zQ2VvblRaNTRGczM3T1Z2QkNBZkk1OEdBUnFZemhhTndua1N1cldqVWJsXzdvTGU4enFnTG8zaW5TbmZvVEYzUHpuNVhpeTF6Tmw2bkl4X2ZnVWo4M3prSkk0cERBeDY0M183OHBDX3BRbjdR</guid></item><item><title>密歇根州百日咳增加了1,792 ％ ：父母应该知道的事情- MLive.com | Michigan sees 1,792% increase in whooping cough: What parents should know - MLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AXSHCF6GRNCE7ORYZF2FBIN4TM"&gt;Another highly contagious vaccine-preventable illness is on the rise in Michigan as uptake for decades-old shots has declined in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6YAAPEUPVNE6HHJS5KMDVKQN7Q"&gt;Pertussis, a respiratory illness also known as whooping cough, sickened 2,081 residents in 2024.

It’s more common to have contaminated greens “when the field is in close proximity to livestock farms or feedlots where animals are being held in densely populated conditions,” Roszkowski explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Arizona and California are big producers of leafy greens in the United States and are often near large cattle operations, according to Detwiler. E. coli, salmonella, or listeria can be introduced to the crops through contaminated irrigation water from nearby cattle farms, he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Runoff from manure lagoons can seep into irrigation canals and contaminate fields with deadly bacteria like E. coli O157:H7,” Detwiler continued.

And it’s not only contaminated water that can be a problem. Some farms use unregulated water sources to irrigate the fields. “Some farms use untreated or minimally treated surface water from rivers, lakes or canals, increasing the risk of contamination,” Detwiler said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it’s time to harvest, there are added risks for pathogens and bacteria to come in contact with lettuce. “Contamination can occur through human handling, contaminated equipment or water used in post-harvest processes to transport, produce or remove soil,” Baker said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the processing plant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are opportunities for pathogens to come in contact with leafy greens once they reach a processing plant. The greens you get in a bag don’t typically come from one field but from multiple farms, complicating traceability and increasing contamination. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greens are processed in a centralized area and distributed — which is convenient for all the companies involved in the process— but not ideal from a food safety standpoint. “Greens from different farms are mixed, washed and packaged together, so one contaminated leaf can impact thousands of bags across multiple states,” Detwiler explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lettuce is washed in large vats, added &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://drexel.edu/cnhp/faculty/profiles/TroutRosemary/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Rosemary Trout," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67f827bee4b0c6da0011396b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://drexel.edu/cnhp/faculty/profiles/TroutRosemary/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rosemary Trout,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; associate professor and program director of Culinary Arts &amp;amp; Food Science at Drexel University. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What you may not suspect, according to Trout, is that “plant foods are usually more often associated with foodborne illness than animal products.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the journey to store shelves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keeping the greens cold is necessary to prevent any pathogens from growing and spreading. According to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, “Not keeping the greens consistently cold throughout the process of harvesting, processing and transporting can cause bacterial growth to occur.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, refrigeration doesn’t eliminate the chance of pathogens; it can help slow them down. “Refrigeration slows bacterial growth but does not kill bacteria, meaning contaminated greens can still cause illness, even if stored properly,” Detwiler said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will washing prewashed salad greens help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re thinking, “W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ell, I’ll wash my prewashed greens for extra safety measures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,” don’t. Washing greens at home doesn’t make them safer because water won’t remove the pathogens, Detwiler said. Rinsing prewashed greens can introduce pathogens that may be lurking on your counter or sink. “Prewashed greens should not be rewashed at home, as doing so can introduce contamination if the sink, utensils, equipment or hands of the preparer are not properly cleaned or sanitized,” Baker said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Washing greens can remove pesticides, but it's not been proven to be effective in removing pathogens.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bacteria or pathogens aren’t obvious and can’t be seen. “If greens are contaminated with pathogens, they cannot be detected by sight, smell or taste … and can’t be removed by washing,” Baker explained. According to Detwiler, “Bacteria like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;E. coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;salmonella&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; can form biofilms that help them stick to the surface of the leaves [and] once attached, these bacteria do not simply rinse off.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Harmful pathogens need to be cooked to be eliminated, as heat kills them, said Detwiler. A big issue with lettuce is it’s usually eaten raw, not cooked, “making it challenging to reduce the risk of foodborne illness,” Baker said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for buying bagged greens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you still prefer buying bagged greens for the convenience, there are several precautions to take. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check for recalls &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before you purchase any salad greens, check if there are any recalls, advised &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Detwiler and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “Stay updated on recalls via the FDA and CDC websites,” Detwiler said. “If your greens are part of an outbreak, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;throw them away immediately.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check expiration dates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts say you should look at the expiration dates before purchasing. Trout advises to only buy what you will eat within a day or two. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for freshness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avoid bags with excess moisture that look wet, as damp environments are a haven for bacteria to thrive, Detwiler said. “Inspect the package to ensure the lettuce looks fresh, without wilting or discoloration, as these signs may indicate improper storage or reduced freshness,” Baker said. You also want to stay away from any bags that have slimy leaves, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski added&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimize temperature changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you’ve purchased greens, don’t let them sit in a hot car or garage or out on the counter. “Avoid drastic changes in temperature when transporting them from the store and when preparing a meal,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “This leads to condensation and creates a moist and warm environment that can encourage both spoilage and bacterial growth.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ice.edu/about/faculty-profiles/olivia-roszkowski" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67f827bee4b0c6da0011396b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ice.edu/about/faculty-profiles/olivia-roszkowski" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Store properly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greens should be kept refrigerated at or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit, say Detwiler and Trout. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy heads of lettuce &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Purchasing a head of lettuce or a bunch of spinach may have the extra step of rinsing and drying before tossing in a salad bowl or stir-frying, but you could be minimizing the risk of lurking pathogens. “Whole heads of lettuce or spinach have less surface area for contamination compared to pre-cut, mixed bagged greens,” Detwiler said. He suggests rinsing them under cold water — not soaking — to remove dirt, debris, any insects and surface-level bacteria. “Wash them at home before eating.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 11:00:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPTUxNR2pyc1BSVjNyTjhmTUtiY01XdG16d3UxSUVMMjlDVWdqMmR6WE53dV9CVXBnXzBzN09SZWNpX19sTnE2dmU3OHd5RXZILWJfaFVKVFQ3QkpJTlRyR1pueU1rdTlZZzlDaWNpYVpBT0RoZW80SmlGTjU3UXpxR3ByalB4WnhZbnAzVV9YYjNWdUXSAZgBQVVfeXFMTTdRamdQMDFPLXl3Rkd3ZGxybGZ6TUpvZDhnUVJVSmFTNGFJMlA5ZXotSUNsTVVwblc4elp6Y05fcTk5NGUwejJETUpQcE0wUFlpNFdQQXlpWDdWSklaWmRjZFczdmM2SllvbEdrcVVCWjFlV1Mxam1TQjBacTN1czJQSUZqTFJOaVdTSTBqU0EzcTgxYjZYUVg</guid></item><item><title>我的朋友一直在我们的孩子面前做一件非常可怕的事情。我需要这个来停止。-石板 | My Friend Keeps Doing a Really Awful Thing in Front of Our Kids.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="207" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9cn0024357592lvbvu8@published"&gt;I know the general rule is don’t comment on other people’s parenting and don’t give unsolicited parenting advice. But! Can you ask a parent to change the way they behave in front of you and your kid? I have some friends, “Elo” and “Raven,” whose 3-year-old, “Jax,” is one of my 3-year-old’s best friends. Elo and Raven divorced when Jax was about 1 ½—thank god, because the tension was through the roof when we all hung out. I love hanging out with Elo and Jax, but I really struggle when I spend time with Raven. Jax has autism and some developmental delays, but in many ways they also behave like any other 3-year-old. Jax is verbal, responds to questions and redirection, and is constantly learning and changing. Every time I see them, I can tell they’ve made leaps in their development, even if their speech and reactions are not the same as a neurotypical 3-year-old. But Raven is always making comments in front of Jax and my child about how Jax “doesn’t understand anything that goes on around them,” and constantly compares our kids: “oh, it’s so nice that your kid takes turns/is calm/knows their name; Jax doesn’t know how to do that and probably never will.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="140" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9g200253575tagb29nf@published"&gt;It’s painful to witness, because it’s so clear that Jax understands everything, even if their responses are not exactly the same as my kid’s. I’m sure it’s self-preservation from having a child with more challenges than Raven expected, but Jax is a smart, sweet kid and Raven needs to see that! I don’t want my child to hear Raven comparing them with Jax. I don’t think it’s appropriate, and I want them to stop doing it. I also want them to stop telling me Jax doesn’t understand anything. Can I ask for these boundaries to be in place when my child and I are present? I’m thinking about writing Raven a letter, because they generally don’t respond well to feedback. It doesn’t feel appropriate to involve Elo even though Elo is also Jax’s parent, because Elo and Raven are divorced.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="159" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9oo002a3575nvi521t1@published"&gt;This would bum me out, too. As the fellow parent of an autistic child, the most generous (possibly too generous?) interpretation I can muster is that Raven may be in pretty ableist medical and/or educational environments that encourage them to do exactly what they’re doing: compare their kid to others, and pay more attention to deficits than strengths. Of course, Raven is allowed to have feelings about Jax’s autism or the support they need. And sure, at least some of Raven’s comments are probably the result of processing those thoughts and feelings aloud, with someone they assume will be somewhat sympathetic (you).&lt;br&gt;But there’s what you feel, and then there’s what you do with those feelings. Raven is making whatever problems she’s having Jax’s problems, too (and yours!). It just isn’t appropriate to vent your fears or frustrations about your disabled 3-year-old in front of said 3-year-old—sorry, but you’ve gotta pick a different time, a different place, a different way.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="180" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9sh002b3575febf7hp5@published"&gt;When encountering ableist parents (and it’s always sadder but unsurprising to me when they have disabled kids themselves), I usually go with one of two options. The easy one is distance: If the relationship isn’t super important to me, I might just let it go, because my time is finite and I don’t need to expose myself or my kid to any more ableism than we already encounter. The other option is (somewhat grudging) education—I don’t mean that I try to engage them in Disability 101 or whatever, but I’ll correct false assertions or push back when needed. I might go so far as to explain why something they said about autism is wrong, or perhaps cite a source like the &lt;a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/"&gt;Autistic Self-Advocacy Network&lt;/a&gt;. I have also had to ask some parents to talk to their own kids about ableism, after those kids said or did something harmful to my kid. Sometimes, though, these things lead us back to distance—either because the other parent/family’s ableism is a dealbreaker for me, or because the other parent just finds me super annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9ui002c3575p94kslvp@published"&gt;This is all to say that if you don’t want to hear ableist stuff from a fellow parent, and you don’t want your kid hearing it, either—or taking your silence for agreement—I think it’s OK for you to say something. And I don’t even really think it is about Jax’s parenting; it’s more about how &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; want to parent your own child. You seem to want them to appreciate and enjoy all kinds of people. You don’t want them to grow up ableist. You don’t want them to think worse of Jax or other kids like them—you want them to respect and see whatever is good in every kid they meet, and not assume that autistic or disabled kids can’t be smart or fun or wonderful friends.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="170" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9xh002d35750dcsog6f@published"&gt;You can think about whether you really want to try to let Raven know about those things you want for your kid, and how—in a letter; in person; parent to parent; etc. But as you probably already know, it might not lead to the outcome you want. Raven might not be in a place where they can hear what you’re saying, or view their situation differently. They might also get mad at you, no matter how kind or careful you try to be. And in the end, they’re going to parent how they choose to parent, and they and Jax will bear the consequences. If they keep making their ableist remarks and it turns out to be a dealbreaker for you, then you may need to decide whether your kid mostly sees Jax during Elo’s time rather than Raven’s. You don’t have the power to change Raven, but you do get to choose what &lt;em&gt;you’re&lt;/em&gt; willing to put up with, and what you want your child to hear and absorb.&lt;/p&gt;

It was obviously devastating. My heart is broken for her. I live on the other side of the country, so I haven’t been able to be as present as I would like. I’m planning a trip over the summer to her coast and I definitely want to see her, but I’m struggling with how to plan the trip without overburdening her and her husband. Normally, I would just ask to stay with them for a few days, but I don’t know if they would want a house guest. But I also think she might be upset if I say I’m staying at an Airbnb in their town. They live pretty far away from other friends I could stay with, but it wouldn’t be impossible to meet for lunch somewhere in the middle. How can I plan this trip to maximize support but minimize stress for them? I just want to give her a hug and make them a meal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kjeah3002j3575xgk0k4ee@published"&gt;It’s kind of you to want to offer in-person support to your friend, assuming she is open to it. I understand why you might prefer not to ask, but in this case, I think there’s no avoiding it—not if you actually want to ascertain and respect her wishes. Unless you talk about it with her, you’re reduced to guessing.&lt;/p&gt;

And I think you can try to bring up the possibility of a visit in a way that puts the least amount of pressure on her. First, let her know that you’re planning to be in the area, and you’d love to see her if she has time. And then just make it clear that you’d be open to doing so in whatever way would be best for her, perhaps something like: “Of course I’d be glad to stay with you, but I’m also very happy to stay somewhere else if that’s easier. I can come over and make a meal, or we can meet for lunch if you’d prefer. Think about it and let me know—I hope to see and catch up, and also have this visit be as easy as possible for you.”&lt;/p&gt;

Then your friend will know all the options and have time to think it over; she won’t feel the pressure of needing to answer right away. She can let you know how she’s feeling about the visit, and what she’d like to do, as your trip gets closer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kjeayx002o35752zv6ibad@published"&gt;My 2-year-old is on a pretty hardcore napping strike right now, after being a reliable two-hour napper for many months. The switch was sudden despite no major life changes. She is my fourth child, so I know a lot of the recommendations already (keep naptime consistent, darken the room, remove distractions) and follow them—I just have not had a child do this before. I have a childproof lock over the doorknob and she will stay in her room for over an hour for “rest,” but she rarely sleeps. I plan to keep enforcing “rest time” and hope she goes back to napping eventually, but in the meantime, do you know anyone who has had a similar experience and lived to tell the tale? Did their kid go back to napping?&lt;/p&gt;

My younger child was never a great napper, and gave it up somewhere between 2 and 2 ½. We referred to that last hour or so before her 7pm bedtime as witching hour, because, well, none of us were at our best. In our case, once the nap was gone, it never came back. But of course it’s possible that your child is just on a nap strike, and will eventually go back to sleeping during the day.&lt;/p&gt;

Even if your 2-year-old doesn’t fall asleep, the chill quiet time is probably good for her (and for you). It can also flow nicely into her having chunks of increasingly independent time, when she doesn’t expect you or anyone else to entertain her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kjebez002u3575ykwmj86d@published"&gt;My wife and I have a dilemma: My mom lives just downstairs from us and is 90 percent awesome with our 5-year-old son. She helps with school drop-off and pickup, does a few hours of child care on the weekend, and is always ready to randomly babysit whenever we need. The 10 percent: Whenever he goes down to visit her, he gets banana bread, trail mix with M&amp;amp;Ms, lemonade (not cut with water or seltzer), and other things we would consider “sometimes” foods. The notorious “free” babysitting strikes again! &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/06/parenting-advice-about-a-grandparent-who-gives-the-kids-sweets.html"&gt;What can we do?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ketyms001f2cqj3bcvda58@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles cases have surpassed 650 in an ongoing multistate outbreak, but federal funding cuts could threaten the response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00023b5vi593glth@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that we are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions,” Dr. David Sugerman, a senior scientist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Tuesday at a meeting of the agency’s vaccine advisers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00033b5vcdn5zhup@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas – the epicenter of the outbreak – has sent several requests to the CDC for resources, Sugerman said, as response costs grow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00053b5v82ynze77@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC recently pulled back billions of dollars in Covid-19 pandemic-era grants that state and local health officials said were also being used to respond to other public health threats, like the measles outbreak. The US Department of Health and Human Services also announced sweeping layoffs two weeks ago, including an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/health/hhs-rfk-job-cuts/index.html"&gt;2,400&lt;/a&gt; employees from the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00063b5v8nlbnnmv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In light of these cuts, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/07/health/measles-outbreak-texas-response-challenges/index.html"&gt;Dallas County&lt;/a&gt;, Texas, says it has had to cancel over 50 immunization clinics. In New Mexico – where at least 63 measles cases have been reported – some staff that was responsible for order vaccines and checking vaccination records had to be let go.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00043b5vjaswvobe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The outbreak is spreading within Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, and Sugerman said the same genotyping sequence of the virus has been found in cases in Kansas and across international borders in Ontario, Canada, and Chihuahua, Mexico.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00083b5vhxl5hy2n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas is mobilizing its resources and moving staff from other areas and domains into the measles response area, Sugerman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00093b5v32hmrh2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But local officials say resource limitations are taking a toll on public health workers and the health system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000a3b5vi9arw0ez@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We still have to be able to do all of our other public health work, so it does become a strain on the system,” said Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health. “Public health doesn’t have … a lot of duplication of staff, so … you’re asking a lot of staff to do additional work beyond their regular daily jobs. It just gets draining.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000b3b5v89ck4lja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say that the effects of these funding cuts will be felt beyond the measles outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000c3b5vn6udkss1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Other types of care are going to be influenced by having to redirect these resources to the setting,” said Dr. Bryan Patenaude, an associate professor of health economics at Johns Hopkins University. “In situations of scarcity where you have limited funding available for health overall, that’s going to place more and more pressure on those other disease areas that really have nothing to do with measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000e3b5v3uuv381o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            History has showed that the costs associated with an outbreak can accumulate in a short amount of time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000f3b5v7evjztri@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Each measles case can be $30,000 to $50,000 for public health response work, and that adds up quite quickly,” Sugerman said Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000g3b5vdax9yjbo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This includes testing, laboratory work, contact tracing, vaccination efforts and health-care costs, according to Dr. Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist with UTHealth Houston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000h3b5v7xn76xr7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hospitalizations can also become quite expensive, she said. The outbreak has put 63 people in the hospital across Texas and New Mexico, with another hospitalization in Kansas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000i3b5vxo1e3knu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The cost is “going to depend on how severely ill the person is … how much treatment they need [and] how long they’re in the hospital,” Troisi said. Given the contagious nature of the airborne disease, measles cases in hospitals also require proper ventilation and isolation procedures, which add to costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9kh5ohr00023b6ow0rdj2wr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to health-care and public health response, experts say there are a vast amount of indirect costs during an outbreak. For example, parents may need to take time off work to care for sick children, or there could be costs associated with transportation to and from facilities, Patenaude said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000j3b5vwa4cwjz9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles can cause a variety of complications including ear infections, pneumonia, encephalitis or death. It is especially dangerous for young and unvaccinated children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000k3b5vyl2h9xnm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been several hospitalized cases of pneumonia and at least one case of neurological symptoms from measles during this outbreak, according to Covenant Hospital in Lubbock.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000l3b5v2b9c0s0q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The more sick kids we see, it also increases the likelihood of seeing an additional death,” Wells said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000m3b5v84tgzy0l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been three deaths reported in this outbreak: two school-age children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico whose death is under investigation. They were all unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exquisitely decorated 7,500-year-old antler from central Sweden was first used as a battle ax and later probably as a fishing harpoon during the Stone Age, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found the antler eight years ago, but had not been able to study it with new technology until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was probably handled as an ax," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ark.lu.se/en/person/larslarsson/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ark.lu.se/en/person/larslarsson/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lars Larsson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of archaeology at Lund University in Sweden, told Live Science. "There are several examples in present-day Denmark of antler axes with severe damage after heavy use." The damage suggests the axes were used in battle, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antler was originally discovered atop a stone platform in a river running from Lake Vättern to the Baltic Sea. It was deposited alongside several other items, including a bone needle, fishing barbs, stone ax blades, engraved animal bones and 20 pieces of human skull. The small cache was discovered at the archaeological site of Strandvägen, a settlement from the Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Strandvägen site is one of the largest Mesolithic sites in Sweden, and unique in the region as preservational circumstances generally are poor in this region," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.su.se/english/profiles/sagu4039-1.191487" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.su.se/english/profiles/sagu4039-1.191487" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sara Gummesson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an archaeologist at Stockholm University in Sweden who was not involved in the study, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/stone-age-man-facial-reconstruction.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/stone-age-man-facial-reconstruction.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Stone Age man's jawless skull was found on a spike. Here's what he looked like.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the highly acidic soils in Sweden, organic materials typically degrade, leaving no trace. Strandvägen is exceptional in that it provides one of the few areas where organic material like antlers has been preserved. This preservation is in part because many of the organic materials were found in water, but also because the soils are in a bedrock that is less acidic, Gummesson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-aR7xxVzF35rtxWiWfb8Y8f" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-aR7xxVzF35rtxWiWfb8Y8f slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/scientists-dating-methods.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/scientists-dating-methods.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;radiocarbon dating&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of bones and artifacts at Strandvägen has shown that the region was inhabited from 5,800 to 5,000 B.C. The settlement is across the river from another important site, called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/61736-ancient-heads-on-stakes.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/61736-ancient-heads-on-stakes.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kanaljorden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was occupied around the same time and has revealed unique finds such as heads impaled on wooden stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;A section of the ornamentation on the antler. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Lars Larsson)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The settlement is located next to the only outlet for Lake Vättern, Sweden's second largest lake," Larsson said. Groups of hunter-fisher-gatherers thrived around this outlet of the lake, using nearby forests for hunting and the lake for fishing, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior excavations at Strandvägen revealed graves, houses, workshops and numerous bone and antler tools, but this antler is the "best-decorated" of the bone and antler objects, Larsson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antler, which comes from a red deer (&lt;em&gt;Cervus elaphus&lt;/em&gt;), measures around 4.2 inches (10.7 centimeters) long and has a width of 0.8 inches (2.1 cm). Radiocarbon dating of tar found within the antler's grooves suggests it is around 7,500 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="from-ax-to-harpoon-3"&gt;From ax to harpoon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand the antler and its history, Larsson and his co-author, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Fredrik-Molin-2094051569" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Fredrik-Molin-2094051569" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fredrik Molin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an archaeologist at Sweden's National Historical Museum, studied it with a digital microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their analysis revealed that the antler was initially filed to produce even surfaces before it was carved with a flint tool to create elaborate hatch-like patterns. Tar was then rubbed into the etched grooves to accentuate the hatchlike designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears that multiple people worked on the antler, with some of the patterns appearing less precise and having been whittled down to make way for new designs. Some of the craftsmen appear to have been more skilled than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antlers served as handles that were attached to sharpened bones or stone blades, and they showed characteristic breakage when overused. This antler has that breakage pattern, suggesting that the decorated antler was likely used as an ax in battle, Larsson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further fragmentation on the antler led Larsson and Molin to believe the ax may have been repurposed into a harpoon, which is another common artifact found across the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;An illustration of the decorations on the antler artifact. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Peter Zetterlund/National Historical Museums)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, "if an item gets broken, many of us buy a new one," Gummesson said. "This was not the case until very recently."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final burial of the antler alongside other valued goods and human remains suggests the antler was ultimately buried as a sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An object may actually have changed use, been given new values, repaired and treasured in many different ways throughout its 'life', which also may have extended beyond one person's lifetime," says Gummesson.&lt;/p&gt;

                Two new studies suggest that stem-cell treatments may be getting closer to becoming widely available for Parkinson's patients.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Patients suffering from Parkinson's disease may soon benefit from a powerful treatment option: stem-cell transplants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a pair of small studies designed primarily to test safety, two teams of researchers found that stem cells transplanted into the brains of Parkinson's patients began producing the chemical messenger dopamine and appeared to ease symptoms like tremor, researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08845-y" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The results indicate that "now we have the potential to really, really halt this disease in its tracks," says &lt;a href="https://med.uth.edu/neurosciences/dr-mya-c-schiess-md/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Mya Schiess&lt;/a&gt;, a neurology professor at UTHealth Houston who was not involved in either study.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has cleared one of the stem-cell treatments for a Phase 3 study, the last hurdle before approval.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;About 1 million people in the United States are living with Parkinson's, a brain disease that attacks neurons that make dopamine. As those neurons die, patients can develop a range of disabling symptoms, including tremor, rigidity, fatigue, difficulty walking and cognitive problems.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stem cells are immature cells that can develop into many different cell types — including neurons that make dopamine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Positive results&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the new studies involved 12 people in the U.S. and Canada living with Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Surgeons administered either a low or high dose of a stem-cell product from BlueRock Therapeutics, a subsidiary of biotech and pharmaceutical giant Bayer. The treatment was derived from human embryonic stem cells, which researchers had coaxed into becoming immature brain cells called neuron progenitors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During surgery, these cells were injected into a structure on each side of the brain that's involved in movement.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The idea is to place these neuron progenitors right where you need them to connect with other neurons in the brain," says &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/doctors/viviane-tabar" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Viviane Tabar&lt;/a&gt;, a stem-cell scientist and chair of neurosurgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tabar is also a founding investigator at BlueRock.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;PET scans taken 18 months later showed that the transplanted cells were producing dopamine. An assessment using a standard rating scale of Parkinson's progression suggested the treatment was also easing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For a typical Parkinson's patient, "you would expect every year to get two to three points worse," says &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/meet-researchers/lorenz-studer-work" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Lorenz Studer&lt;/a&gt;, who directs the Center for Stem Cell Biology at the Sloan Kettering Institute in New York and is a scientific adviser to BlueRock.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Participants in Studer's study had a very different experience: "The high-dose group, they got about 20 points better."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The low-dose group also appeared to benefit, but not as much.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A second study by researchers in Kyoto, Japan, used induced pluripotent stem cells, which are derived from a patient's own cells, rather than an embryo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Seven patients had the cells injected into both sides of their brains. As in the U.S. and Canadian study, the transplanted cells produced dopamine and the patients appeared to see their symptoms decrease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;No patient in either study experienced a serious adverse event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Long time coming&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The apparent success comes after &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487308/#:~:text=Core%20tip%3A%20The%20first%20studies,with%20high%20variability%20among%20subjects." target="_blank"&gt;decades of frustration&lt;/a&gt; trying to replace the brain cells killed off by Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Starting in the 1980s, scientists began transplanting fetal tissue into people with Parkinson's. But the efforts produced uneven results and sometimes troubling side effects like uncontrolled movement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stem cells promised better results. But the technology evolved slowly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studer's team, for example, began looking at stem cells to treat brain diseases more than 25 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For us, it's quite an exciting time," he says, "finally seeing some of the fruit of that work."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One reason it's taken so long, Studer says, is that stem cells have the potential to become so many different kinds of cells. It takes just the right mix of chemicals at just the right time to produce a neuron that makes dopamine, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It took us nearly 10 years to figure out the recipe, how to make specifically those dopamine cells," he says. "It took us another 10 years to have the product that we would dare to put into patients."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another challenge was creating and packaging large numbers of stem cells that could be easily delivered to surgeons. So researchers developed techniques that allowed them to freeze stem cells until they were needed.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"You just thaw them and suspend them in an approved medium" before surgery, Tabar says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now that many of the technical hurdles have been cleared, stem cells appear poised to offer a new treatment option for Parkinson's, and perhaps other brain diseases like epilepsy or Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If we're missing neurons, we're able to replace them," Tabar says. "And the full expectation is that these cells are not going to function as cells that just release [a substance like] dopamine. They're going to rebuild circuitry."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There still may be risks though, which means scientists will need to continue monitoring the stem cells they transplant into a patient's brain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They're going to be there for a long, long time," Schiess says. "So you have to follow up and see if there is tumor formation or something of that nature."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Schiess also notes that stem cells don't cure an underlying disease like Parkinson's. So the new neurons may eventually succumb to the same disease process.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even so, she thinks they could offer new hope to many patients, including those who are no longer responding to drug treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

With a record number of parents seeking vaccine exemptions for their children and childhood vaccination rates declining, more outbreaks of measles, pertussis, and other diseases are not just likely, they’re inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“When vaccination rates fall, the first disease you’re going to see show up is measles because it’s so contagious, but others will follow,” says Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Texas, the epicenter of the current measles outbreak, and a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “This is a troublesome trend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Last year, there were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;285 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; for all of 2024. This year, cases have already risen to over 700, and two children &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"}' href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;have died of the disease&lt;/a&gt;. Children have also been dying of whooping cough. In Louisiana, two infants died of the disease in the past six months—the state’s first deaths from the illness since 2018—according to a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.facebook.com/61561728868838/posts/the-louisiana-department-of-health-is-closely-monitoring-ongoing-increased-pertu/122146254860390962/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.facebook.com/61561728868838/posts/the-louisiana-department-of-health-is-closely-monitoring-ongoing-increased-pertu/122146254860390962/"}' href="https://www.facebook.com/61561728868838/posts/the-louisiana-department-of-health-is-closely-monitoring-ongoing-increased-pertu/122146254860390962/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recent statement&lt;/a&gt; by the state’s surgeon general.

And in February, a local health department in Washington confirmed that a Spokane County child under the age of 5 &lt;a data-offer-url="https://srhd.org/news/srhd-reports-pertussis-death-in-spokane-county" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://srhd.org/news/srhd-reports-pertussis-death-in-spokane-county"}' href="https://srhd.org/news/srhd-reports-pertussis-death-in-spokane-county" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;died of whooping cough&lt;/a&gt;—the first in the state since 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;A type of bacterial infection, whooping cough is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It causes flu-like symptoms and violent, rapid coughing. It’s known for the characteristic, high-pitched “whoop” sound when someone inhales after a coughing fit. The disease is especially dangerous for babies because it can interfere with their breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Nationwide, there were 35,435 cases of whooping cough in 2024, compared with 7,063 in 2023, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf"&gt;provisional surveillance report&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC. Cases hit a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html"&gt;low of 2,116 in 2021&lt;/a&gt; due to social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic and were still on the rebound in 2023. Yet 2024’s numbers far outpaced the 18,617 cases seen in 2019 and 15,609 cases in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The disease can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, and death. Infants and young children are particularly at risk. Around a third of infants under six months old who came down with whooping cough in 2024 required hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“The crux of the disease is that it’s caused by this particular bacteria, &lt;em&gt;Bordetella pertussis&lt;/em&gt;, which creates a toxin, and that toxin can be very damaging to our lungs,” says Amy Edwards, associate professor of pediatrics at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Vaccination is the best way to protect against infection and severe disease. The diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, or DTaP, vaccine is given in five doses in infancy and early childhood. Immunity from vaccination and natural infection eventually wanes, and a booster shot is recommended at age 11 or 12 and every 10 years after, including for adults. The CDC advises pregnant people to get a booster during each pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNY3doVzlnMF9JR2pkR3owb2w3TnRPaV9XT3NlU2RZeW94RHI1XzdaNDFIc1ZldDBCVUZiWmFZWTFlQW1vNy1PdmJIcnZ0ekp6UGVMWVhwMWFGanR3VTdyb3k3b2tuSW9QMWgxeWR5cGY3Sm8zeG5MNzVadWdYUjE4TGhoWWpKbDkw</guid></item><item><title>倡导者说， RFK Jr.的健康削减使结束HIV的目标遥不可及- HuffPost | Advocates Say RFK Jr.’s Health Cuts Put Goal Of Ending HIV Out Of Reach - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQYVcxaXpER012NmFZTUhkYTlBVkt4UlNPSzFhNzE3dV9rNmhNak9TRXRFYmVSckhwQmp1MXh3ZUI3MXpjUTRxYkhFTGhSWk9vU3RYaHVEUEFXNmZEU2RvMXpsWXdJTDFHWDNvWllWTUlxeFVvWlc1YjlPcGxJWmZyZ2lBMUZoaDNVMHh6SjVTZTU1OW9R0gGaAUFVX3lxTE5iOTBEeXdLRGJBYndrSDRweURiU2NUUkVyeEg2UV9GNnU4OHM0cmE1Sk8yV2JlZHpwUXdIUkNNWWJzM0JjT0RHLTNJcXBLRk90UWQ0Rm9NbWg3NVBsUmVFSEhyZ2Y1NHI0YW5GRXEzVmp0NzE5eHBGMDYxOHZIWWR2UXhaSGU3YmhwMXAzcVBmMmdfaWVWV194Ymc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors and public health advocates were once able to imagine the end of the HIV epidemic in our lifetime.

The proposed budget slashes one-third of the agency’s spending, and eliminates funding for HIV services, including the Minority AIDS Initiative, several Ryan White HIV/AIDS programs, the CDC’s HIV/AIDs prevention and surveillance activities, and preventive services for elderly people and people living with disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s spelling out a situation where we’re going to see more people get HIV and die from AIDS in the U.S. and internationally,” said Jeremiah Johnson, the executive director of PrEP 4 All, an HIV advocacy organization pushing for a nationwide program to boost access to preventive medication to underinsured communities. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The cuts across federal health agencies have left funding to research institutions dedicated to improving HIV care in limbo.

PrEP, which is taken routinely in pill form, provides nearly complete protection against the virus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But almost two-thirds of the 1.2 million people who could benefit from PrEP are not taking the medication, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/director-letters/expanding-prep-coverage.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="CDC data" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680025ebe4b0485a7732be89" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/director-letters/expanding-prep-coverage.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;CDC data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The vast majority of people who currently have access to PrEP are white, despite making up a small percentage of new diagnoses. By comparison, Black and Latino populations, and trans women all experience higher and growing rates of HIV diagnoses, especially in Southern and rural areas.

If approved, it would be the second injectable PrEP on the market, following the approval of cabotegravir in 2021. Both long-acting drugs are also used in treatment for people living with HIV, and offer an alternative to people who deal with pill fatigue. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, Johnson anticipates that “we won’t see the kind of launch that we had hoped for” for PrEP “to get out to communities” as the Trump administration continues to slash funding towards HIV prevention research, and as RFK Jr. promotes “non-evidence based understandings of HIV science.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Here we are at a moment of innovation, and rather than capitalize on all of that, we’re going to turn our backs and see more HIV infections and more health care expenditures due to new HIV infections, and a lot more sickness and suffering for our communities,” Johnson said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the past, HHS has promoted low or no cost PrEP to patients through programs like Ready, Set, PrEP, for example. The program was started by then-President Donald Trump in 2019 as part of his Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative. The future of that program is now uncertain as the preliminary HHS budget axes funding for the Ending the HIV Epidemic plan altogether. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But with RFK Jr. at the helm of the agency, Trump’s initial goalpost for tackling HIV is now much further away. RFK Jr. has a history of discrediting vaccine efficacy, and championing junk science to insist that changes in lifestyle and nutrition could combat chronic illness. In particular, he has questioned the HIV epidemic, including whether the human immunodeficiency virus causes the chronic condition of AIDS, which it does, and instead attributed the condition to the use of poppers, a recreational drug popular in queer communities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Ofole Mgbako, an HIV doctor and assistant professor of medicine and population health at NYU Langone Health, warns that the loss of consistent treatment for HIV could lead to new strains of the virus that are resistant to the drugs currently on hand. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Treatment interruptions and people being on and off of treatment can breed resistance to the virus. We have not yet found a cure,” Mgbako said. “We have found really effective treatments to keep the virus suppressed within someone’s body, but that means they have to remain on treatment consistently.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many of the cuts to grants came after Trump signed several executive orders instructing agencies to axe programs dedicated to improving “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” or addressing trans or broader LGBTQ+ communities. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In mid-February, nine nonprofit community health and advocacy organizations focused on servicing the health needs of the LGBTQ+ community, including HIV prevention and treatment, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://lambdalegal.org/case/san-francisco-aids-foundation-v-trump/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="sued the Trump administration" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680025ebe4b0485a7732be89" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://lambdalegal.org/case/san-francisco-aids-foundation-v-trump/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt;sued the Trump administration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, alleging that the executive orders resulted in their grants being terminated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Among them was the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, which had received a grant concurrently with the University of California San Francisco, to study the effectiveness of Doxy PEP, a drug that helps to prevent bacterial sexually transmitted infections after sex. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leading charity British Heart Foundation (BHF) has suggested that "beetroot juice might help lower blood pressure".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The charity elaborated: "Beetroot juice can be a concentrated source of nitrates, and it’s thought that one of their effects is to lower blood pressure."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31442782" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nitrates can also be found in other fruits and vegetables, such as spinach, celery, kale, bananas and strawberries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diet plays a crucial role in managing blood pressure levels; healthy eating is one of the best ways to reduce blood pressure readings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to fruits and vegetables, eating wholegrains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy is recommended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are the foundations for the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"[The DASH diet] has been shown to be helpful by numerous studies," the BHF noted, expanding on each component.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take wholegrains, for example, which are rich in fibre and are "linked to a lower risk of heart and circulatory diseases".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31442764" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

But since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took charge of H.H.S., the Trump administration has indicated that it will stop funding research on the health effects of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The N.I.H. said in an internal document obtained by The New York Times that it was the agency’s new policy “not to prioritize” research related to climate change. The document also described the organization’s intent not to fund research on gender identity, vaccine hesitancy or diversity, equity and inclusion.

They’re all store cupboard essentials, easily paired, and found at your local supermarket and all over the world: Rice and lentils or rice and black beans, hummus and bread, rice and peas, couscous and chickpeas...The combos go on! Of course, some plant foods are richer in protein than others. I listed them in the notes app on my phone when I gave up meat, to make sure I remembered them when shopping and get to include them in my diet with ease. Below, I’m breaking that down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;My four golden rules for eating more protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;30 grams of protein at breakfast
This is a commandment exulted by all health and wellness experts, and underlined by Dr. Emilie Steinbach: “A &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/30-grams-of-protein-for-breakfast" target="_blank"&gt;higher-protein breakfast&lt;/a&gt; improves the feeling of satiety and reduces hunger and appetite, and therefore cravings, throughout the day, even late in the day. To achieve all of these benefits, protein intake would need to be between 25 and 35 grams and account for 40 per cent of the total calorie intake of breakfast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To hit this target, I generally incorporate two to three eggs into my breakfast—one egg equals 6 grams protein. Often, I place them on two toasted slices of Nordic, rye, or spelt bread (that makes 5 to 7 grams of protein), hummus (2 grams of protein), and sprouted seeds on top (&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/fenugreek-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;fenugreek&lt;/a&gt; is my go-to). Other days, I’ll do an omelette with either chia seeds, hemp seeds, or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/brewers-yeast" target="_blank"&gt;brewer’s yeast&lt;/a&gt;, and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Optimized snacks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My snack breaks are a key way boost my daily protein intake. A handful of almonds (21 grams of protein per 100 grams) accompanies a precious square of dark chocolate—or two, or three…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I eat a banana, I add peanut butter (25 grams of protein per 100 grams) and sometimes put it on a slice of toasted bread with chia seeds on top. I also occasionally have sheep’s yoghurt, skyr, or a smoothie in which I incorporate chia seeds or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/amal-clooney-diet-breakfast" target="_blank"&gt;spirulina powder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Sprinkle everything with seeds and powders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sprinkle seeds and powders everywhere! I even carry a small glass jar containing a mix of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/hemp-seeds" target="_blank"&gt;hemp seeds&lt;/a&gt; (30 to 35 grams of protein per 100 grams) and brewer’s yeast (you may be surprised to know it’s very high in protein: 46 grams per 100 grams), which I take with me to restaurants to sprinkle on my salads. I even take it with me on vacation!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 08:10:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNRUdZZko2NnlUa0hBYkU1ekRSTlh1enNqSXM5ZDNkZkc3UXhrZnFLWkwyYzU1RzB1bkM3dGtnanRqYzF6MURkNG9DcDZfZVlBZllIQXIyTENlOUJZUmtCMTZLLVU4SC1BaUMyNmxVaUhqcnd4bDNoNDBGVHg5MThUd3g4cmd2dFJPVGc</guid></item><item><title>每天吃两片普通水果可以“显着”降低胆固醇水平- Surrey Live | Eating two pieces of common fruit each day can 'significantly' lower cholesterol levels - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQcElTbFlXdGMxZ2pXWEpCdGpSR2ltWmIxbmdkOVNiVm1YV0xkYm1GVTRFVDZBU0lOVm5kQUl2M1QwVGF6X0J6WDM4clJBekx4Ny1WYV90ZktOM3A4LXQyRHRZbndSbnlyODBGdWVNNklBdzh0NEQxZm83U3o4TjdIMWxRcnpzZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having an excess of the fatty substance cholesterol in one's blood is what constitutes high cholesterol. This can lead to serious health issues as it contributes to the formation of blockages within blood vessels over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consequently, individuals with high cholesterol are at a greater risk for medical crises like strokes and heart attacks. Diet is listed among the multiple factors that could cause high cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In particular, consuming an excessive amount of saturated fat has been shown to heighten cholesterol levels. Nonetheless, certain foods have been identified as effective in lowering cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An expert has urged that a common piece of fruit found on UK supermarket shelves should be consumed more frequently for this specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GloucestershireLive cited nutritionist Eli Brecher asserting: "Apples are a nutrient-dense fruit, containing 10 percent of your daily vitamin C intake, alongside copper, vitamin K and vitamin E. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"An apple a day is a great habit for a healthy heart as not only does the pectin help to lower cholesterol but the polyphenols in apples are linked to lower blood pressure and a reduced risk of a stroke."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, research published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2020 supports this claim. The study, which involved collaboration between researchers from the UK and Italy, concluded that consuming two apples daily can lead to a notable decrease in cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specific findings from the study, which saw 40 participants eat two apples each day for eight weeks, revealed a drop in their cholesterol measurements. Researchers have discovered that daily apple consumption can lead to healthier, more relaxed blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This effect is similar to what is observed with other foods rich in natural compounds called polyphenols, such as red wine and tea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Julie Lovegrove, senior author of the study from the Hugh Sinclair Unit of Human Nutrition at the University of Reading, remarked: "It seems the old adage of an apple day was nearly right." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apples are rich in a type of flavonoid known as procyanidins, which possess potent antioxidant properties and may help reduce low-density lipids (LDL or "bad" cholesterol).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The high concentration of antioxidants in apples could potentially offer protection against neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and help maintain brain function. The skin and core of the apple are also packed with pectin, a type of soluble fibre, which has been shown to improve blood cholesterol levels, a risk factor for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, studies have shown that drinking apple juice, which does not contain pectin, does not yield the same cholesterol-lowering benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Health benefits in test&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether an apple a day will keep the doctor away is questionable, although one study of 8,000 adults published in JAMA Internal Medicine that looked at hospital and doctor appointments by apple-eaters and non-apple eaters did find that people who ate at least one a day were slightly less likely to visit a GP. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are definite benefits to making apples a daily habit, though. They contain less vitamin C than oranges but more fibre than melons and twice as much as pears. Many of the benefits are linked to pectin, the soluble dietary fibre that is found predominantly in the skin and core of apples. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Pectin, also found in pears and plums, has been shown in studies, including a review in the journal Clinical Nutrition, to improve blood cholesterol levels,” says the registered nutritionist Rob Hobson, author of Unprocess Your Life. “That will help to reduce the risk of heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are your cholesterol levels too high?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A healthy total cholesterol level in the blood is considered to be five or less millimoles per litre (mmol/l). More specifically, a healthy level of high-density lipoprotein is one or more mmol/l.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And you should have four or less mmol/l of low-density lipoprotein. The only way to be certain of your cholesterol levels is to have them checked. If you're worried about your cholesterol levels, it's advisable to consult with your GP.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information on cholesterol levels from the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/high-cholesterol/cholesterol-levels/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;click here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 06:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQcElTbFlXdGMxZ2pXWEpCdGpSR2ltWmIxbmdkOVNiVm1YV0xkYm1GVTRFVDZBU0lOVm5kQUl2M1QwVGF6X0J6WDM4clJBekx4Ny1WYV90ZktOM3A4LXQyRHRZbndSbnlyODBGdWVNNklBdzh0NEQxZm83U3o4TjdIMWxRcnpzZw</guid></item><item><title>每天步行30分钟的20个好处-印度时报 | 20 benefits of walking for 30 minutes every day - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2wFBVV95cUxQR1U5MEdQYlVtQXA2YnZuQVlhLU95cW9lRDZ2R1pZWVZkQXFKTHNLSk9oSlJWZEE2M2I3VlhKSWFZd1VOSko4cmM4TlQxZGN0QklTRnNZenIzejFfNzFsLVUzUkJYM19UQ1ctSWdkV044WTVPWDFzRGxFUDU2ZldEV09xRG5YTTFpY0ZWbXE1UHFyZFltcFdoYWV4ZC1YOFBlUTBRWXgybXo0QzlxY0ZwcDZWak05UEFRS196MVNUSjBVUDRvelFYVGJBNGgwZkh0d1lHOElDRzlJMm_SAeABQVVfeXFMTlFIUjJXWm5HUVREOUI5LWdUMU5aQTNIVTlLbTZvanNINUlyU2stYXdnR0ZPMTRqM0EtWWY5aGlQb3gyRGIxYUFkRWt6Zi1obWF3N1dlU0h1ZTZud09EeDliVEU5WFlmUTJYak5IU1Y2TjY1WUctRlRXM2F5b0JybkhaeE1CN0gyejNHUXBxSi11bjdOODFJWTRBY1dfOFNuM2RfNVVrc09PUGg5eDlIWEFRaWVndER5LW5hajlmeGc0cndMdTBWWnduUlVOaTd6c3dNdHZBSGpUekZWX1UzdWM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is therapeutic in itself. A brisk 30-minute walk may seem like nothing much when every other person talks about complex workouts to stay fit. However, it can work wonders for your physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Here are 20 science-backed benefits of walking for 30 minutes every day that will inspire you to lace up your shoes and go out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Reduces the risk of heart diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you walk regularly, it helps control blood pressure and lower cholesterol levels, which will in turn help in improving cardiovascular health. Walking may reduce your risk of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Helps to maintain a healthy weight&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, weight gain and obesity are one real concern for folks these days. Walking burns calories, and boosts metabolism, which can help you achieve weight loss results faster. It also aids in digestion, making it an easy and sustainable way to maintain weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe walking for 30 minutes a day can significantly improve your mental well-being?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Reduces your stress levels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress buster? Go for a walk! A daily walk gives your mind a break, helps regulate cortisol (the stress hormone), and can even trigger the release of endorphins, your body’s natural mood elevators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Increases your energy levels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel fatigued often? Try walking for 30 minutes. Even when you're tired, walking gets your blood circulating and your muscles moving — leaving you feeling more energized and alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Helps to boost your mind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking increases oxygen flow to the brain, sharpens memory function, and enhances focus. It also provides mental clarity and even memory retention. It’s a natural brain booster!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Gets the blood pumping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body requires a regular blood flow throughout the nerves and cells. A walk stimulates circulation, which nourishes your organs and muscles with fresh oxygen and nutrients, keeping your entire system healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Prevents obesity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess fat is an invitation to several diseases. Walking combats sedentary lifestyles, helps regulate appetite, and improves fat metabolism — all of which are key in preventing obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Can help to reduce anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling anxious lately? Go for a walk. Physical movement like walking has a calming effect on the nervous system, helping to ease anxious thoughts and promote mental balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Increases functioning of the lungs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With each step and breath, walking strengthens lung capacity. It fills the lungs with fresh oxygen which helps improve oxygen exchange, making your respiratory system more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. Improves your body’s access to Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting out for a walk naturally makes you get enough vitamin D for your body. Walking outdoors allows your skin to soak in sunlight, which is crucial for vitamin D synthesis — essential for bones, mood, and immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;11. Reduces the risk of cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer prevention may be a claim, but walking does cut the risk factors that may be causing it. Regular walking may help reduce the risk of several cancers, especially breast and colon cancer, by improving immunity and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;12. Improves sleep quality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep is the root cause of many health issues. A consistent walking routine helps regulate your sleep-wake cycle and reduces insomnia, especially if done during the day in natural light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;13. Gives you time for self-care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding it difficult to get time for yourself? Start by walking for 30 minutes. It can also be the perfect time to listen to music, podcasts, or simply enjoy your own thoughts — offering a daily dose of mindfulness and self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;14. Improves coordination and balance&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing balance as we age is a real thing. Regular walking strengthens lower body muscles and joints, improving your balance and reducing the risk of falls, especially as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;15. Improves quality of life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to upgrade your life? Start walking. From mental clarity to better fitness and reduced disease risk, the overall effect of walking daily leads to a more active, confident, and fulfilling lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;16. Reduces chances of diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking helps regulate blood sugar levels and improves insulin sensitivity, making it a powerful habit that can balance the blood sugar to prevent or manage type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;17. Walking can spark creativity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thoughts seldom come to those who stay still. Studies have shown that walking — especially outdoors — boosts creative thinking and problem-solving, making it great for brainstorming sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;18. Strengthens bones and muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want stronger bones? Walking is a low-impact, weight-bearing exercise that supports bone density and strengthens major muscle groups, especially in the legs and core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;19. Can improve blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypertension is a new-age epidemic. A brisk walk every day can help lower systolic blood pressure, offering a natural way to manage or prevent hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;20. May strengthen the immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to look for ways to bolster your immunity? Moderate daily exercise, like walking for 30 minutes, enhances immune response by promoting healthy circulation and reducing chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 30 minutes of daily walking can have significant positive effects on your body and mind; you don't need expensive equipment or a gym membership. Every step counts, whether you're taking a leisurely stroll in the park or a vigorous walk around your neighborhood. All set to accept the first one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;20 mins of extra walking every day slashes cardiovascular disease risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 06:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2wFBVV95cUxQR1U5MEdQYlVtQXA2YnZuQVlhLU95cW9lRDZ2R1pZWVZkQXFKTHNLSk9oSlJWZEE2M2I3VlhKSWFZd1VOSko4cmM4TlQxZGN0QklTRnNZenIzejFfNzFsLVUzUkJYM19UQ1ctSWdkV044WTVPWDFzRGxFUDU2ZldEV09xRG5YTTFpY0ZWbXE1UHFyZFltcFdoYWV4ZC1YOFBlUTBRWXgybXo0QzlxY0ZwcDZWak05UEFRS196MVNUSjBVUDRvelFYVGJBNGgwZkh0d1lHOElDRzlJMm_SAeABQVVfeXFMTlFIUjJXWm5HUVREOUI5LWdUMU5aQTNIVTlLbTZvanNINUlyU2stYXdnR0ZPMTRqM0EtWWY5aGlQb3gyRGIxYUFkRWt6Zi1obWF3N1dlU0h1ZTZud09EeDliVEU5WFlmUTJYak5IU1Y2TjY1WUctRlRXM2F5b0JybkhaeE1CN0gyejNHUXBxSi11bjdOODFJWTRBY1dfOFNuM2RfNVVrc09PUGg5eDlIWEFRaWVndER5LW5hajlmeGc0cndMdTBWWnduUlVOaTd6c3dNdHZBSGpUekZWX1UzdWM</guid></item><item><title>大疱性表皮松解症：皮肤可以从拥抱中撕裂的男孩- BBC | Epidermolysis bullosa: The boy whose skin could tear from a cuddle - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5ybUVIS3lybmdiVlotYkc5TGxHZWttSTUxczFGYlFqMVpLMDlydTN2dF9GTTcxbDZ2UmNDc1c2aUF2aklvVGRzZlE4UXo3OUg1YWFPWmIweDhjUdIBX0FVX3lxTE9McmhkdnFqMmxsN01Fd1c2eTZscmktbVo1akhmTnVxenZNcy1xY3lUdk1RTlJBMWpEWk5xU2VYQzJHLUQ0cGZLdUpwcFZ3QnotcWtJU1JzN3U1WHI4YTl3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-737179d2-0 dAzQyd"&gt;Our son's skin could tear from a cuddle due to rare disorder&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/255a/live/5fcf0090-1ac0-11f0-8699-af8a0981754f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/255a/live/5fcf0090-1ac0-11f0-8699-af8a0981754f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/255a/live/5fcf0090-1ac0-11f0-8699-af8a0981754f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/255a/live/5fcf0090-1ac0-11f0-8699-af8a0981754f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/255a/live/5fcf0090-1ac0-11f0-8699-af8a0981754f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/255a/live/5fcf0090-1ac0-11f0-8699-af8a0981754f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/255a/live/5fcf0090-1ac0-11f0-8699-af8a0981754f.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/255a/live/5fcf0090-1ac0-11f0-8699-af8a0981754f.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Erin and Calum with their son Albi who has blisters on his face because of his rare skin condition.

1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Seed and vegetable oils are staples in many kitchens.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;nenetus – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To further back up that claim, new research by &lt;a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2025/04/omega-6-fatty-acid-promotes-the-growth-of-an-aggressive-type-of-breast-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Weill Cornell Medicine&lt;/a&gt; discovered that linoleic acid — a fat found in seed, vegetable and nut oils causes breast cancer cells to multiply and grow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are different forms of breast cancer — and the constant use of linoleic acid puts women at risk of developing the most aggressive type: triple-negative.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this invasive form spreads faster and requires a more aggressive treatment plan — which might include a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and sometimes radiation therapy. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The survival rate is also lower — at 77% compared to regular breast cancer which is around 90%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We now know that linoleic acid feeds cancer cell growth in a very specific way,” said Dr. John Blenis, the study’s senior author and a cancer researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blenis seems optimistic about this discovery because he feels that it “sheds light on how to define which patients might benefit from specific nutritional recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And before people panic over this news, “The findings do not warrant blanket avoidance of seed oils but suggest moderation and selectivity, especially for high-risk individuals,” Blenis reassured.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The expert went on to say that this discovery is just one piece of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A balanced, whole food diet remains an important cornerstone of cancer prevention, and a strategy everyone can adopt,” the doctor explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re unsure what is considered a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/31/health/are-seed-oils-really-that-bad-for-you-dietitians-explain-the-risk/"&gt;seed oil&lt;/a&gt; — canola, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, soy, sunflower, safflower and rice all fit the bill. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Seed oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids and lower in omega-3s — and that’s where the problem lies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The problem seems to be in the proportions of the two fats that we take in,” Stephanie Schiff, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Northwell Huntington Hospital told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We tend to get a higher than healthy ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s and that can lead to problems with inflammation in the body,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, these oils should be used in moderation and this news reinstates that people should eat a balanced diet consisting of fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

"Depression prevalence decreased with increasing age. Overall, prevalence was highest in adolescents ages 12–19 (19.2%) and lowest in adults age 60 and older (8.7%)," it found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings come from a federal survey conducted between August 2021 and August 2023. Participants were asked whether they had experienced specific symptoms linked to depression in the previous two weeks. Their responses to these validated screening questions were then scored to assess whether they met the criteria for depression. Depression symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;How can depression be effectively managed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is depression? Is it preventable?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Major depression is a common and treatable mood disorder characterized by changes in cognitive and physical symptoms lasting for at least 2 weeks," the US CDC defines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is a lot more than just a bad mood or feeling low. It’s a mental health condition that affects how you think, feel, and act. It can make even the smallest tasks feel like climbing a mountain. And the tricky part? You can’t always see it. Someone may look perfectly fine on the outside but be battling a storm within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression, often misunderstood as being lazy or overthinking, is a real, medical condition that needs just as much attention as a physical illness. It affects millions globally and is becoming more common, especially with the fast-paced, high-stress lifestyle many of us lead today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building healthy habits early on—like regular exercise, eating nutritious food, getting enough sleep, staying socially connected, and managing stress—can all help protect your mental health. Think of it as creating a strong base so your mind has something solid to stand on during tough times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression doesn’t look the same for everyone, but here are some common signs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling sad, hopeless, or empty most of the time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Losing interest in things you usually enjoy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changes in appetite or weight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trouble sleeping—or sleeping too much&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling tired or low on energy all the time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty concentrating or making decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling worthless or guilty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thoughts of self-harm or suicide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any of these last more than two weeks and interfere with your daily life, it's a sign you might need support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to deal with depression&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step is to acknowledge what you’re feeling. And know that it’s okay to not be okay. You don’t have to tough it out alone. Talk to someone you trust—a friend, a family member, or a professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to a therapist or counselor. Therapy isn’t just for “serious” cases—it’s a safe space to sort through your thoughts. Move your body, even a 15-minute walk can help your brain release feel-good chemicals. Eat right and hydrate, your gut and brain are connected. Junk food can mess with your mood. Stick to a routine, even small daily rituals—like making your bed or taking a morning shower—can create a sense of structure. Limit screen time, social media can sometimes amplify negative feelings. A little digital detox can work wonders. Try journaling or mindfulness, writing down your thoughts or just sitting quietly with your breath can help you feel more grounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 01:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswJBVV95cUxPdk9USHRYTHlrZVctVkZIVkszX1JtcEs2VVc2SmdXREVmUDlnbVRZaUpEOWM3ZFhwaFV2bkVQVkRoZTE2SnFYam9wRmZqcGRsUGVCOGdPQlNwVGFJT09FYkVvdjgtU0RxZVZMT1hQa1lJZlpTOW9QM2ZFUTlWSmZWLThUb05YMi1PQzJLTmhRcW5fV3dRTTFOLXRJVlgwcnNtY25PUjRHNjRreFlsSF9YZDNYSUh6UXc1UFVQbnptZmdFbmQzOXlGZmk5aHFYQ2pSTDF5aFFPSWVTWmxjS0sycnJMNjZLYkx5a0lDLTdxNG9MVnFzZHNmcmtXVVFJY3FCSk9udEU3YkFfN01TTEdkVGpIZDl2SWEtRFVTb3JHb19nNU9ESnh3bnBLdnRNS2dfZ0lz</guid></item><item><title>您是否在20分钟内吃完一顿饭？可能是时候放慢脚步了- VINnews | Do You Eat a Meal in 20 Minutes or Less?

&lt;p&gt;Experts tend to focus on the kinds of foods you can eat to improve your health. But the speed at which you devour your dinner matters just as much. There are risks with eating too fast — think stuck food and the potential to overeat before your brain tells you to stop. (Inhaling your food also risks annoying your slower-paced dining companions or the person who took the time to cook your meal.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips from scientists on how to slow down and take a more mindful approach to consuming your &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-norwalk-health-nutrition-fd87eae765ce4775a868a8aa74ddd94f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How fast is too fast?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re the kind of person who can regularly polish off breakfast, lunch or dinner in less than 20-30 minutes, you are eating too fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It takes about 20 minutes for the stomach to communicate to the brain via a whole host of hormonal signals that it’s full,” said Leslie Heinberg, at the Center for Behavioral Health at the Cleveland Clinic. “So when people eat rapidly, they can miss these signals and it’s very easy to eat beyond the point of fullness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Why is that a problem?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who eat quickly are likely to swallow more air, Heinberg said, which could lead to bloating or indigestion. Not chewing your food properly can also compromise digestion, meaning you won’t get all of the nutrients from your food. Unchewed pieces of food also could get stuck in your esophagus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some previous studies have suggested that people who eat quickly have the highest risk of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/how-common-is-obesity-us-5663c0388b19009eae3834d695710bc4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, while the slowest eaters were the least likely to be obese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How can you slow down when eating?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, turn off the TV and put down your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re eating while you watch TV, people tend to eat until there’s a commercial or the show is over,” Heinberg said, adding that people are less inclined to pay attention to the body’s own signals that it’s full. “When we do things while we’re eating, we’re eating less mindfully. And that often causes us to eat more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said that when people focus exclusively on eating, they tend to enjoy the meal more and eat less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heinberg also acknowledged the pace at which you eat is often an ingrained habit, but said change is still possible. She suggested things like using your non-dominant hand to eat, trying utensils you might not ordinarily use like chopsticks or taking a deliberate break to drink water when your plate is partially empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a busy life, it might be unavoidable to eat lunch at a work meeting or snack while running errands. But Sarah Berry, chief scientist at the British nutritional company ZOE, said when possible, “be mindful of what the food tastes and feels like.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we’re not fully present, it’s very easy to eat more quickly and not notice how much we’ve consumed,” Berry said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Chew your food, just like mom told you to&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the simplest things to do is to increase the number of bites you take, said Helen McCarthy, a clinical psychologist with the British Psychological Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you chew each mouthful a little bit longer, that will slow down your eating,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of food you eat may also make a difference, pointing out that it’s much easier to eat &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/ultraprocessed-foods-kennedy-f6a2607b14c4a2787c68801a8e0646bc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ultraprocessed&lt;/a&gt; or fast foods quicker, because they typically have a softer texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to eat vegetables and protein at the same rate as something that’s highly processed and requires less chewing,” McCarthy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of her patients also reported an unintentional side effect once they began eating more slowly, referencing one woman who often ate a tube of potato chips every evening. When McCarthy told her to slow down and eat every single chip individually, her patient told her “it was like having a mouthful of claggy chemicals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She didn’t find (the chips) enjoyable anymore,” McCarthy said.&lt;/p&gt;

The Oregon Veterinary Diagnostics Laboratory at Oregon State University confirmed the presence of RHDV on April 14, 2025. Most rabbits at the rabbitry have since died; the remaining rabbits are under quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affected rabbits were housed outdoors where they may have potentially been exposed to wild rabbits. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) has not diagnosed RHDV in wild rabbits in Western Oregon, but the virus is known to be present in wild populations in Central and Eastern Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RHDV is a viral disease that causes sudden death in rabbits, ODA explains. Signs of the disease in rabbits may include respiratory or neurological symptoms and bloody nasal discharge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The virus is highly contagious among rabbit populations," ODA says. "It can spread through contact with infected rabbits, meat, fur, or materials coming into contact with them. RHDV poses no human health risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ODA says the virus only infects rabbits and does not pose a risk to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can I prevent the spread of RHDV?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash and disinfect hands, clothing, gloves, footwear, cages, and equipment between rabbits from different sources.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quarantine new rabbits away from existing ones for 30 days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep pet rabbits inside to avoid exposure to environments potentially contaminated by wild or feral rabbits or by people, vehicles, or implements that can spread the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immediately contact ODA (503-986-4711) if you suspect RHDV or have sick or freshly dead rabbits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ODA and ODFW ask the public to report rabbit mortalities to track the virus's presence and movement. Call 503-986-4711 to report domestic  or feral (domestic animals that escaped into the wild or were abandoned) rabbits suspected of having died from RHDV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To report the death of wild rabbits, contact ODFW by calling 1-866-968-2600 or email &lt;a href="mailto:Wildlife.Health@odfw.oregon.gov" target="_blank" title="mailto:Wildlife.Health@odfw.oregon.gov" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Wildlife.Health@odfw.oregon.gov&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href="https://oda.direct/RHD" target="_blank" title="https://oda.direct/RHD" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;https://oda.direct/RHD&lt;/a&gt; for more information about Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domestic rabbit owners should contact their veterinarian for more information on preventing RHDV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KATU</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:35:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOd1J3Z1hqNHdiSWtwTmN6bW1jcjRlWG1INTlkb0syc2x2VVNZRXpkUThZZkRCaEQ1V1gxY2Z5ZEJqRkxmZXRFRHVpbGFfM0xETFNqZ25hYWUtWjR2VktUU1dUVHBqODFkdnVLeHRRd1hGQ25qa2ZKdGxmNmdaSXo3LVhNaDBlTkh0UTBCMGl0azJtYkVCMFhWaUU4UnUtMVk</guid></item><item><title>肠道微生物组可能是治疗睡眠呼吸暂停的关键-神经科学新闻 | Gut Microbiome May Hold Key to Treating Sleep Apnea - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTFBWYnFCcVFQVWhsSWcyWkJTQ2JCeGpFZnk4ZXlZZWRSMjdaWHVWRXhQbDg1Q0psTk5wazQ3c3B6TFV0LXh0OWg0VW9JbXlfYktGc0d0Z3hBR2JsRDlZUy1fcVZ0Vk1SSDd1WHd6eGp6MA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new review highlights growing evidence linking gut health to sleep apnea, suggesting that changes in gut microbiota may influence the severity of sleep-disordered breathing. These microbial imbalances are associated with increased inflammation, leaky gut, and impaired gut-brain communication—all of which may exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also discuss the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as possible messengers carrying microbial signals to the brain that affect sleep regulation. The findings support future research into microbiome-based therapies as a novel approach to managing sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbiome Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Altered gut microbiota may worsen sleep apnea through inflammation and impaired gut-barrier function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut–Brain Signals:&lt;/strong&gt; Extracellular vesicles could mediate communication between gut microbes and sleep-regulating brain regions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Improving gut health may offer new avenues for treating or mitigating sleep apnea symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Marshall University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new scientific review from researchers at the Marshall University Joan C.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It explores how gut microbiota—the diverse community of microorganisms living in the digestive tract—may influence the development and severity of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alterations in gut microbiota composition have been consistently observed in individuals with sleep apnea, and may induce “Leaky gut,” or impaired intestinal barrier integrity, that in turn promotes systemic inflammation that worsens sleep apnea symptoms and facilitates the emergence of end-organ injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recent studies suggest that changes in gut microbiota diversity and composition may play a role in the onset or progression of sleep apnea,” said Hicks, lead author on the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This connection may be mediated by impaired gut barrier function, inflammation, immune responses and gut-brain communication pathways.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review also highlights the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs)—tiny particles released by cells that carry molecular signals—as potential messengers between the gut and brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These EVs may affect sleep regulation by modulating immune responses or transporting microbial signals to the brain and could serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets in modulating the gut–brain axis in sleep apnea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors, which include David Gozal, M.D., M.B.A., Ph.D. (Hon); Sarfraz Ahmed, Ph,D.; and Abdelnaby Khalyfa, M.S., Ph.D., all of Marshall University, call for future longitudinal studies to better understand how gut microbiome changes over time may influence the development or consequences of sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also advocate for deeper investigation into the mechanisms by which microbial species and their metabolites affect sleep, and for development of new treatments aimed at improving gut health as a strategy for managing sleep apnea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is exciting to see medical students taking the lead in exploring complex and emerging areas like the gut–sleep connection,” said Khalyfa, professor of biomedical sciences at Marshall University, corresponding author on this study and Rebecca’s mentor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This kind of research not only advances our understanding of sleep apnea but also demonstrates the vital role early career trainees can play in shaping the future of medicine in general, and of sleep medicine in particular through innovation and collaboration.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep apnea and microbiome research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cebda3a7baa6fbf8f88ea3afbcbda6afa2a2e0abaabb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sheanna Spence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://marshall.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marshall University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sheanna Spence – Marshall University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2025.106493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Interplay between gut microbiota and exosome dynamics in sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;” by Rebecca Hicks et al. &lt;em&gt;Sleep Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interplay between gut microbiota and exosome dynamics in sleep apnea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is characterized by recurrent reductions or interruptions in airflow during sleep, termed hypopneas and apneas, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SDB impairs sleep quality and is linked to substantive health issues including cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, as well as cognitive decline. Recent evidence suggests a link between gut microbiota (GM) composition and sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, GM, a community of microorganisms residing in the gut, has emerged as a potential player in various diseases, and several studies have identified associations between sleep apnea and GM diversity along with shifts in bacterial populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the concept of “leaky gut,” a compromised intestinal barrier with potentially increased inflammation, has emerged as another key player in the potential bidirectional relationship between GM and sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the potential effectors could be extracellular vesicles (EVs) underlying gut-brain communication pathways that are relevant to sleep regulation and function. Thus, therapeutic implications afforded by targeting the GM or exosomes for sleep apnea management have surfaced as promising areas of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This review explores current understanding of the relationship between GM, exosomes and sleep apnea, highlighting key research dynamics and potential mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted, focusing on studies investigating GM composition, intestinal barrier function and gut-brain communication in relation to sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:16:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBWYnFCcVFQVWhsSWcyWkJTQ2JCeGpFZnk4ZXlZZWRSMjdaWHVWRXhQbDg1Q0psTk5wazQ3c3B6TFV0LXh0OWg0VW9JbXlfYktGc0d0Z3hBR2JsRDlZUy1fcVZ0Vk1SSDd1WHd6eGp6MA</guid></item><item><title>致命病毒在道格拉斯县（ KTVZ ）的家兔种群中得到确认 | Deadly virus confirmed in domestic rabbit population in Douglas County - KTVZ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxQTm1MeFAtWlFQd2h3eE04Um1PbTNFOVR1Vm02SmpZRWYwbjE0cFpyMkpVeTRiX1ZOUzctckJrRlVIQ3FmTmdRanRKblYzbV9FSXNJT0lJbmxVRVFrXzJFMTlaNUZleGgwUGlpWS05bl85WEpBemM2N2pxaVRObzNaX0pMaktwb29IZ0NmSzMyX3daU2hXcUpHQWhHWVNOUTJPdFFKWU5Ddkx2LWYza2NsSkxGYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="post-1518173" class="panel-group post-1518173 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-government-politics category-health category-news category-oregon-northwest category-pets category-top-stories category-wildlife"&gt;
    

    
 

    

           

	&lt;div class="entry__content"&gt;
        
&lt;p&gt;SALEM, Ore. (KTVZ) -- The Oregon Department of Agriculture said Wednesday it has confirmed Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease (RHDV) in domestic rabbits in a Douglas County rabbitry. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rabbit's owner noted sudden rabbit deaths, reporting the symptoms to their veterinarian late last week. The veterinarian suspected RHDV and immediately reported it to ODA. The Oregon Veterinary Diagnostics Laboratory at Oregon State University confirmed the presence of RHDV on Monday. Most rabbits at the rabbitry have since died; the remaining rabbits are under quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The affected rabbits were housed outdoors, where they may have potentially been exposed to wild rabbits. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has not diagnosed RHDV in wild rabbits in Western Oregon, but the virus is known to be present in wild populations in Central and Eastern Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RHDV is a viral disease that causes sudden death in rabbits. Signs of the disease in rabbits may include respiratory or neurological symptoms and bloody nasal discharge.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The virus is highly contagious among rabbit populations. It can spread through contact with infected rabbits, meat, fur, or materials coming into contact with them. RHDV poses no human health risk. The virus only infects rabbits and does not pose a risk to humans.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I prevent the spread of RHDV?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wash and disinfect hands, clothing, gloves, footwear, cages, and equipment between rabbits from different sources.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Quarantine new rabbits away from existing ones for 30 days.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Keep pet rabbits inside to avoid exposure to environments potentially contaminated by wild or feral rabbits or by people, vehicles, or implements that can spread the disease.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Immediately contact ODA (503-986-4711) if you suspect RHDV or have sick or freshly dead rabbits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ODA and ODFW ask the public to report rabbit mortalities to track the virus's presence and movement. Please call 503-986-4711 to report domestic or feral (domestic animals that escaped into the wild or were abandoned)rabbits suspected of having died from RHDV. To report the death of wild rabbits, contact ODFW by calling 1-866-968-2600 or email &lt;a href="mailto:Wildlife.Health@odfw.oregon.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wildlife.Health@odfw.oregon.gov&lt;/a&gt;. Visit &lt;a href="https://oda.direct/RHD?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;https://oda.direct/RHD&lt;/a&gt; for more information about Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency says domestic rabbit owners should contact their veterinarian for more information on preventing RHDV. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to recommend that any RSV vaccine for adults that is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for high-risk adults aged 50 to 59 be recommended for use in that age group. If the recommendation is accepted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — which the ACIP advises — insurance companies will have to cover the cost of the vaccine for eligible individuals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How quickly that might happen is unclear. ACIP recommendations must be approved by the director of the CDC, and at present, the agency does not have a director. Susan Monarez, who had been serving as acting director until she was proposed as &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/24/susan-monarez-trump-pick-cdc/"&gt;the nominee for the position&lt;/a&gt;, has not yet been through the Senate confirmation process. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson said the CDC’s chief of staff Matthew Buzzelli would take receipt of the six recommendations from the committee that arose from Wednesday’s meeting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Faust, a Boston emergency room physician and public health expert who writes the &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/scoop-cdc-has-no-acting-director" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Substack column Inside Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, reported last week that legal experts say that in the absence of a CDC director, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could sign off on the committee’s recommendations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In addition to the RSV vaccine vote, the committee also recommended use of a new meningococcal vaccine from GSK, a chikungunya vaccine from Bavarian Nordic, and voted to tweak a previous recommendation for another chikungunya vaccine, made by Valneva. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If accepted by the CDC, the vote on the use of RSV vaccines in people in their 50s would initially apply to vaccines sold by GSK and Pfizer. Moderna is in the process of applying to the FDA to extend the license for its RSV vaccine to include high-risk people aged 50 to 59, and the new policy — if approved — would cover it as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A cost analysis generated by the CDC and researchers from the University of Michigan suggested that use of these expensive vaccines in selected members of this age demographic could be cost saving. In particular, it was suggested that people who have undergone lung transplantation, or who have heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, or severe obesity should be considered for RSV vaccination in their 50s. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Michael Melgar, a CDC vaccines researcher, said around 30% of U.S. adults aged 50 to 59 would qualify.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The present CDC recommendation for use of these vaccines in older adults is that anyone aged 75 and older should get the shot and anyone aged 60 to 74 who is at high risk of severe illness from RSV should too. The ACIP has been slow to recommend broader use of RSV vaccines for older adults because of a couple of concerns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two of the vaccines — the Pfizer and GSK products — appear to be linked to an &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/02/29/rsv-vaccines-may-be-linked-to-small-increased-risk-of-developing-guillain-barre-syndrome/"&gt;elevated risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. (There have been no reports of GBS among people who received the Moderna vaccine.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another concern relates to the fact that it is still not known how often these vaccines will need to be given, and whether getting an additional dose at some later date will adequately boost protection. The data to date suggest that while additional doses do lead to an increase in antibodies, antibody levels do not return to the levels seen after a first shot with these vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At present the recommendation for RSV vaccines is that they are a one-time shot, though it is widely expected that at some point there will be a recommendation for additional shots later. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The committee also voted to recommend use of a new chikungunya vaccine, Vimkunya, for travelers and scientists who work on the chikungunya virus in laboratories. The vaccine, made by Bavarian Nordic, is licensed for use in people aged 12 and older.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya infection, which is triggered by the bite of an infected mosquito, causes fever, and muscle and joint pain that can be severe, and in some cases long lasting. Transmission has been recorded in about 120 countries globally, though the disease occurs in outbreaks that are unpredictable in their frequency. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recommendation is that the vaccine can be used in people who are traveling to a country where an outbreak is underway. The committee further recommended that use of the vaccine could be considered in people who are traveling to a place where the risk of transmission is elevated, if the person will be staying in the location for a period of six months or longer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The committee previously had recommended use of another chikungunya vaccine, made by Valneva. The earlier recommendation had stressed use in people 65 and older, who are at increased risk of having serious illness if they contract the virus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But six reports of serious side-effects in older adults after vaccination — five of which required hospitalization — prompted the committee to amend that recommendation on Wednesday. While it did not recommend against use of the Valneva  in people 65 and older, the recommendation — if accepted, will feature a precaution about use of the vaccine in that age group. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The committee also recommended use of GSK’s pentavalent — five in one — vaccine to protect against meningitis, MenABCWY, for people aged 16 to 23 for whom a vaccine protecting against meningitis B is recommended, and for people aged 10 and older at increased risk of developing meningococcal disease because of underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Despite concerns that the administration might meddle with a committee of vaccine advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, their first public meeting since President Trump's inauguration followed its usual course. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to expand the options for meningococcal vaccines and to lower the age of recommendation for RSV vaccines to include people aged 50 to 59 with certain risk factors. They also voted to recommend vaccines for the tropical disease chikungunya for travelers or lab workers who are likely to be exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;These recommendations go to the CDC director, who usually heeds them but ultimately determines whether or not they become policy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Committee members also previewed topics such as flu and COVID vaccines that will be considered more formally in the next public meeting, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;scheduled for June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A rescheduled meeting raises concerns &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over two days, members sat through detailed presentations on data and modeling for a range of vaccines – from mpox to flu, COVID and chikungunya – and asked questions to sharpen their assessments of the risks and benefits of different vaccines. The meeting got weedy at times, as the presenters and committee members dug into technical details, which is typical.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee had been scheduled to meet in February, but the event was postponed shortly after the confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees CDC. The postponement heightened concerns about possible interference.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I am encouraged that the proceedings of ACIP have resumed, giving the American public a window into the future of our nation's vaccine policy in a time of great uncertainty,"  Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester, a Democrat from Delaware, said in an emailed statement. "As America faces measles outbreaks and a changing political landscape, the public deserves transparency."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In watching the meeting, Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and data scientist, said, "It seems pretty much business as usual – and it's sad that that is newsworthy.," She writes the newsletter "Your Local Epidemiologist."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, Jetelina said, there were nuances that reflect changes made by the Trump administration over the past few months. Trump's team has made deep cuts to funding and resources for public health. The administratione also elevated individuals who have long questioned the safety and efficacy of vaccines, despite strong evidence supporting them, into positions of influence over research and policy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Resource cuts were evident&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some effects were evident from the start. Technical issues plagued the beginning of the meeting and required a fresh link to the public livestream. "As you may have noticed, there have been some changes with the recent reductions in force, including our communications group, so I ask that you please be patient with us," said &lt;a href="https://wag.app.vanderbilt.edu/PublicPage/Faculty/Details/32055" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Keipp Talbot,&lt;/a&gt; professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University and chair of the committee.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The resource cuts were top of mind for some committee members. Charlotte Moser, co-director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, probed for declines in CDC's ability to evaluate how safe vaccines are, and how well they work.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Are all of those [data collection systems] still funded to actively collect data through this season and then in anticipation of next season?" Moser asked, after a presentation on the efficacy of the 2024-2025 flu vaccine. In response, CDC epidemiologist Sascha Ellington said three of four flu vaccine surveillance networks would continue operating and that one would be shut down.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Funding cuts are also affecting the response to the ongoing measles outbreak in Texas, according to a CDC presentation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The outbreak started in late January and has grown to more than 600 cases across Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. "There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas," said Dr. David Sugerman, a senior scientist at CDC working on its measles response. The state recently lost several hundred million dollars in public health funding, in a federal clawback of COVID funds that began late last month. "The estimates are that each measles case can be $30,000-$50,000 for public health response work, and that adds up quite quickly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Committee member Dr. Jane Zucker, adjunct professor in the Department of Community Health Sciences at SUNY Downstate School of Public Health, had worked on containing a New York City measles outbreak in 2018. She said that the outbreak, which had around 650 confirmed cases, cost &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" target="_blank"&gt;more than $8 million&lt;/a&gt; to bring under control.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A new FDA representative raises safety questions&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition to the official committee members, the meeting is attended by members from U.S. health agencies and professional medical groups.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For this meeting, the Food and Drug Administration was represented by Dr. Tracy Beth Høeg, a special assistant to the commissioner, who has criticized CDC for recommending &lt;a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Testimony-3-27-2023-TracyBethHoegFINALv2.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;school closures during COVID&lt;/a&gt;. She took the liaison seat previously occupied by Dr. Peter Marks, the top vaccine regulator at FDA who was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/28/nx-s1-5344010/fda-peter-marks-rfk-jr" target="_blank"&gt;forced to resign in March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Høeg has questioned vaccine safety, and she raised concerns in this week's meeting. Following a presentation on a study of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-04-15-16/02-Creech-Mpox-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;mpox vaccine in teens&lt;/a&gt;, Høeg said: "They excluded adolescents with underlying significant heart conditions and significant medical conditions. So I think it's important for providers to keep in mind that … we don't really know about the safety in those adolescents."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Høeg asked about "bias in our estimates" in a presentation on influenza vaccine efficacy, arguing that vaccinated people may be overrepresented because they may be more likely to seek out testing. CDC staff responded that their studies are designed to account for these and other types of bias. "We're confident that [the impact of bias] is minimal and that the estimates are accurate," said Dr. Aaron Frutos, an epidemiologist with CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Public comment in support of committee&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When HHS postponed the meeting in February, the reason was "to accommodate public comment in advance of the meeting," according to an HHS spokesperson at the time.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Those who were chosen by lottery to speak during the public comment period for this meeting praised the committee's work. "They play a really crucial role in ensuring that vaccine recommendations are based on available evidence and are reviewed rigorously by scientists who are qualified to do so," said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan and co-editor in chief of the journal &lt;em&gt;Vaccine&lt;/em&gt;. "It is essential for public trust and accountability that this occurs in a transparent and inclusive way that the public can observe and participate in."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading cancers worldwide, especially in countries that follow a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-to-limit-to-reduce-colon-cancer-risk-11694207" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Western lifestyle and diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Worldwide, 1.2 million new CRC cases are diagnosed each year, making it the second most common cancer in men and the third most common in women. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the U.S., colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in American men and women, excluding skin cancers. The lifetime risk for developing CRC is about one in 24 for men and one in 26 for women, depending on risk factors.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientists are always looking for ways to reduce the risk of diseases like CRC, which includes cancers of the colon and rectum. In a review of previously published studies, researchers focused on the relationship between vitamin D and CRC. They published the review in April 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down their findings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study was a review, meaning that the researchers assessed a variety of previous studies to look for overarching connections the results shared.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers searched scientific databases for studies on CRC and vitamin D. While they initially found over 10,000 studies, they ended up with 50 after sifting through them and removing duplicates and those that didn’t meet their criteria. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Specifically, the researchers only wanted to include studies in adult human participants who either had CRC (or precursors for CRC) or had a documented vitamin D deficiency. They also sought out cases where participants were given a vitamin D supplement as part of the study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-it-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did It Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to these researchers, vitamin D has been shown to have many benefits in our bodies, including supporting communication between nerve cells, regulating blood pressure and preventing respiratory infections. It plays roles in maintaining gut health, thyroid hormone levels, blood sugar levels and even mitigating the harmful effects of aging. Vitamin D also acts as an antioxidant, reducing inflammation, suppressing autoimmune responses and supporting the function of immune cells.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers also cite a previous study that suggests that vitamin D inhibits uncontrolled cell growth and the formation of new blood vessels that “feed” cancer cells (called angiogenesis) and promotes apoptosis (killing abnormal cells).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what did these researchers find regarding vitamin D and CRC? While there was some conflicting evidence, they state that vitamin D deficiency is strongly linked to an increased risk of CRC, partly because that deficiency exacerbates intestinal inflammation, which promotes CRC progression.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Specifically, one meta-analysis of 31 original studies reported that compared to the lowest dietary intake of vitamin D (10 ng/mL), the highest amount (80 ng/mL) showed a 25% reduction in CRC risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Nurses’ Health Study, a common long-term U.S. study used to find connections between lifestyle factors and disease risk, showed that women with the highest vitamin D intake had a 58% reduced risk of CRC compared to those with the lowest intake. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Iowa Women’s Health Study found that those in the highest calcium and vitamin D intake reduced their risk of CRC by about half. The Spanish PREDIMED study had similar results, as did studies that used vitamin D supplementation (as opposed to getting it through food). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Polyps and adenomas are precursors to CRC and are commonly found and removed during colonoscopies. Researchers found evidence that vitamin D can also help prevent polyps. For example, a Canadian study with 1,409 participants found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the probability of polyp development by 33% and the risk of high-risk adenomatous polyps by 43%. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, researchers found that vitamin D, both dietary and supplemented, plays a crucial role in preventing and treating colorectal cancer by reducing inflammation, regulating immune responses, promoting cancer cell death and inhibiting tumor growth. For those who have CRC, vitamin D may help promote better survival rates and reduce death rates from CRC. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There were a few limitations to this review. First, though many studies showed protective benefits of vitamin D on CRC, most could not define the mechanisms through which these benefits occurred. Study authors also state that more large-scale, randomized clinical trials need to be done, which will provide more answers, including optimal dosage and formulations of vitamin D supplements. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Based on the evidence in this review, vitamin D appears to help prevent CRC and may help people with CRC survive it. Unfortunately, vitamin D is a commonly deficient vitamin. Worldwide, vitamin D deficiency is estimated to range from 30% to 50%, with even higher rates seen in specific populations.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/conditions-when-you-need-vitamin-d-supplement-8576496" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency&lt;/a&gt; include being a woman, living in regions that experience colder winter climates, having darker skin and living in a low- and middle-income country where proper nutrition and supplements may be more limited. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides having a genetic predisposition for CRC, other risk factors include older age, sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in unhealthy fats and red meat and low in fiber. An imbalanced gut microbiome also plays a role, as do having inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, frailty and diabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is called the sunshine vitamin because your body manufactures it with UVB rays exposure—aka sunshine. But if you live in regions that experience cold winters, it can be difficult or impossible to get enough sun exposure during those months. In the warmer months, you should consider your skin cancer risk and balance it with sun exposure. You also need to have enough skin exposure to make vitamin D—face, arms and legs. Plus, pollution, darker skin and possibly sunscreen reduce sunlight absorption, reducing vitamin D production. For these reasons, diet and supplementation may be more reliable avenues for getting enough vitamin D. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because it is possible to overdo it and end up with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-vitamin-d-per-day-is-too-much-8605769" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D toxicity&lt;/a&gt;, before you start putting the vitamin D supplements to use, it helps to know your blood levels. This can be done by requesting a blood test from your primary care practitioner. If you end up being deficient, meeting with a registered dietitian can help you figure out what foods and how much of each you need to eat each day to get your levels up. An RD can also help you supplement, if that is your desire or if it’s recommended. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another finding from this review was that healthy eating patterns, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2058981/ultimate-mediterranean-diet-shopping-list/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, tend to be plentiful in vitamin D and other anti-inflammatory nutrients. The Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, fish, dairy and healthy fats. While there aren’t a lot of food sources of vitamin D, ones that contain it include egg yolks, fatty fish (like salmon, tuna, mackerel and sardines) and mushrooms. Fortified dairy and orange juice also contain vitamin D. Researchers note that a holistic dietary approach may be a better strategy than focusing on one isolated nutrient.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This review of 50 studies found a strong connection between adequate vitamin D levels and a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because vitamin D deficiency is so common, it can be helpful to have bloodwork to test your levels. Based on the results, if you need to increase your levels, try adding foods rich in vitamin D, including whole eggs, salmon, mushrooms and fortified dairy products, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/yogurt-colorectal-cancer-study-11682870" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;like milk and yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, to your diet. Following a healthy eating pattern, like the Mediterranean diet, can also be beneficial.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you choose to supplement, work with a registered dietitian or your primary care practitioner to determine the best dose for you.

Researchers found that music-induced “chills” are linked to the release of natural opioids in key brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants with higher opioid receptor density showed stronger brain responses to music, highlighting individual differences in musical enjoyment. These findings explain why music can evoke powerful emotional reactions and suggest potential applications in pain therapy and mental health treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opioid Release:&lt;/strong&gt; Favorite music triggered the release of opioids in brain regions tied to pleasure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual Variation:&lt;/strong&gt; People with more opioid receptors had stronger brain responses to music.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Music-induced opioid activity may help explain music’s pain-relieving effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Turku&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new imaging study by the Turku PET Centre in Finland showed that listening to favorite music affects the function of the brain’s opioid system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music can evoke intense pleasure, sometimes experienced physically as pleasant “chills.” While the effect of music on pleasure is clear, the brain mechanisms behind musical enjoyment are not yet fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108830"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows a woman in headphones and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results show that favorite music influenced opioid release in several brain areas associated with the experience of pleasure. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain’s opioid system is known to be involved in pleasurable experiences related to survival-critical behaviors, such as eating and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new study from the Turku PET Centre in Finland demonstrates for the first time that listening to favorite music also activates the brain’s opioid receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study measured the release of opioids in the brain using positron emission tomography (PET) while participants listened to their favorite music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine how the density of opioid receptors affects brain activation when listening to music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that favorite music influenced opioid release in several brain areas associated with the experience of pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release of opioids was also linked to how often participants reported &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/music-chills-neuroscience-6167/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;experiencing pleasurable chills&lt;/a&gt; while listening to music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, individual differences in the number of opioid receptors correlated with brain activation during music listening: the more opioid receptors participants had, the more strongly their brains reacted in MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results show for the first time directly that listening to music activates the brain’s opioid system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The release of opioids explains why music can produce such strong feelings of pleasure, even though it is not a primary reward necessary for survival or reproduction, like food or sexual pleasure,” says Academy Research Fellow Vesa Putkinen from the University of Turku.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Lauri Nummenmaa adds: “The brain’s opioid system is also involved in pain relief. Based on our findings, the previously observed pain-relieving effects of music may be due to music-induced opioid responses in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides significant new insight into how the brain’s chemical systems regulate the pleasure derived from music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results may also help develop new music-based interventions, for example, in pain management and the treatment of mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this music and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#75161a1818001b1c1614011c1a1b06350001005b131c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tuomas Koivula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://utu.fi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Turku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tuomas Koivula – University of Turku&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00259-025-07232-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pleasurable music activates cerebral µ-opioid receptors: a combined PET-fMRI study&lt;/a&gt;” by Vesa Putkinen et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Journal of Nuclear Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pleasurable music activates cerebral µ-opioid receptors: a combined PET-fMRI study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The μ-opioid receptor (MOR) system mediates incentive motivation and the hedonic component of primary rewards such as food and sex. However, there is no direct in vivo evidence for the involvement of the MOR system in pleasure derived from aesthetic rewards such as music. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We measured MOR availability with positron emission tomography (PET) and the agonist radioligand [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil with high affinity for MORs during the listening of pleasurable music and neutral baseline condition. Haemodynamic responses associated with dynamic pleasure ratings during listening to music and control stimuli were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PET results revealed that pleasurable music increased [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil binding in several cortical and subcortical regions, including ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex, known to contain “hedonic hotspots”. [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil binding in the nucleus accumbens during the music condition was associated with number of pleasurable chills, linking the subjective experience of pleasure to striatal opioid release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual variation in baseline MOR tone influenced pleasure-dependent haemodynamic responses during music listening in regions associated with interoceptive, sensorimotor, and reward processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings provide the first neuroimaging evidence that pleasurable music modulates MOR system function. The results indicate that the μ-opioid system governs complex aesthetic rewards in addition to biologically essential primary rewards.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 21:39:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE5ueUZJcE8zbkpIN2VNdFdMbDhLY1NxWUR2dGlQdmY3ci05blI5SWdyMHlpMWhCcHZ1bU9aUXByTkxxZTYtVXM2d1NKME9Xd1FsbFQxUFI3UUNkb01ZV0d0QVVROExaVHFmOVZoREtCdUtMenZFLXBXeQ</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心科学家：德克萨斯州麻疹疫情应对因资金削减而受损-《华盛顿邮报》 | CDC scientist: Texas measles outbreak response hurt by funding cuts - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNQndOUU9WSXc0MTBxLWRBVUJFelVsWkNjVDU4bTEydzgtVWdNcmNSc3hUZmZKa2NkOHc4Q2dwRTRXQnVVdFVraXlrRXlEZkEtM0RzS1ppYl9IalIwUUdIMnFRUnBDdUNNUl96QURPQnBXVEt0OVJMcDd1U2JUSXBWZ3VzQW80UV9RRERETTZ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CJUOBZ2YKRFEJM4H5OHMPEF4B4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A senior scientist overseeing the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/24/measles-vaccine-booster-outbreak-states/" target="_blank"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; response by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a recent pullback of pandemic funding from states has hurt Texas’s response to its growing outbreak, now linked to 90 percent of cases in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MAOORTXVORDBNHTFGKHUYJ6IP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas,” David Sugerman, a senior CDC scientist, said during a meeting of the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-meeting-postponed/" target="_blank"&gt;CDC’s vaccine advisory panel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2HSRUD4MVNHORIUBM5APQNRZFM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There are funding limitations in light of covid-19 funding dissipating,” Sugerman said&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Tuesday, referring to&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/25/trump-presidency-news/#link-ROZTVMB7WVHMDKXQN4NW5YJQDI" target="_blank"&gt; $11.4 billion in coronavirus-related funds&lt;/a&gt; that the Department of Health and Human Services ordered pulled back from state and local health departments and community organizations late last month.

			&lt;p&gt;In 2024, after 60 years of searching, geneticists finally identified the gene behind the marmalade coloration in domestic cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two independent teams of researchers found any fiery-hued fuzz on our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cats-bond-securely-to-their-humans-maybe-even-more-than-dogs-do"&gt;beloved clawed floofs&lt;/a&gt; is likely the result of a missing segment of DNA in a non-protein-coding part of the cat's genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's been a genetic mystery, a conundrum," Stanford University geneticist Greg Barsh &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/gene-behind-orange-fur-cats-found-last"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Sara Reardon at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barsh and his colleagues discovered cat skin cells from which orange fur sprouts express 13 times as much RNA from a gene called &lt;em&gt;Arhgap36&lt;/em&gt;, compared with skin cells from cats with no orange hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expecting to find the protein-coding section of the overproductive &lt;em&gt;Arhgap36&lt;/em&gt;  gene had mutated, the researchers were surprised to find it was the sequence preceding it that instead contained a deletion, presumably affecting the rest of the gene's expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5 &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair#Length_measurements"&gt;kilobase&lt;/a&gt; deletion was present in every orange cat the researchers examined out of a database of 188 cats, which included 145 orange, 6 calico/tortoishell, and 37 nonorange cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One finding didn't come as a surprise. As long predicted, the mutated gene is located on the cat's X chromosome, explaining why the orange color appears so differently between the sexes. Most orange cats are male, while most female cats with some orange fur end up with patchworks of different colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145632" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145632" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/RedBlackAndWhiteCalicoKitten-e1733183714509.jpg" alt="Red black and white calico kitten" class="wp-image-145632 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/RedBlackAndWhiteCalicoKitten-e1733183714509.jpg 640w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/RedBlackAndWhiteCalicoKitten-e1733183714509-379x415.jpg 379w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/RedBlackAndWhiteCalicoKitten-e1733183714509-600x656.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145632" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A calico kitten. (Theresa Donahue McManus/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Taken together, these observations provide strong genetic and genomic evidence that the 5 kb deletion causes sex-linked orange," Barsh and team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.21.624608"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since humans first co-habitated with cats &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-lost-history-of-cat-domestication-can-finally-be-told"&gt;nearly 10,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, it's been a curiosity that a black cat and an orange cat can be parents to an unexpected array of kitten colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Male kittens from this pairing are mostly either orange or black, as might be expected. But female kittens can have a calico's patchwork of black, orange and white, or a tortoiseshell's marbling of orange scattered through black fur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145622" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/TortoiseshellCatWithOrangeMarblingThroughBlackFur-e1733181850151.jpg" alt="tortoiseshell cat with orange marbled through black fur" class="wp-image-145622 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145622" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A tortoiseshell cat. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-close-up-of-a-cat-with-yellow-eyes-Q8EbbKgOPe0"&gt;Yosei G/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both teams confirmed the mutation responsible for orange fur is on the X chromosome, which is why such clear differences in colored patterning can appear between the sexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike males that end up with just one copy of this mutation on their solitary X chromosome, females end up with two copies, one on each the X's they receive from each parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mammals randomly inactivate one of the two X chromosomes in each of their cells to avoid expressing an excess of the chromosome's products. This leaves female orange kitties with an active orange mutation in some of their developing skin-cell tissues, right next to neighboring cells in which the X chromosome with the mutated gene is deactivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On rare occasions that both X chromosomes carry the mutation, the female grows into furry fireball as ginger as any male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145629" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145629" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/FieryOrangeKittenWithBlueEyes-e1733183466200.jpeg" alt="It's Taken Scientists 60 Years to Identify The Gene Making Orange Cats Usually Male" class="size-full wp-image-145629" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145629" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An orange kitten. (Zelenenka/iStock/Getty Images Plus)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orange cats happen to have a hilarious reputation for &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/orange-cat-behavior"&gt;not being the brightest&lt;/a&gt; of their species. Anecdotes aside, such links between kitty coloration and cognition are scientifically unsupported, with no obvious negative consequences from this mutation in health or mental wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arhgap36&lt;/em&gt; is known to cause developmental problems in other animals when it is over- or under-functioning. But it seems that in orange cats, the gene is overexpressed only in developing and mature pigment cells called melanocytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The difference between tortoiseshell and calico cats is the presence of an additional white spotting mutation in calico that affects the ability of developing melanocytes to survive as they migrate away from the neural crest, allowing melanocyte clones that do survive to expand in a larger body region," Barsh and colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.21.624608"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second study, led by Kyushu University geneticist Hidehiro Toh, also identified &lt;em&gt;Arhgap36&lt;/em&gt; as the orange cat fur gene. They found greater expression of this gene suppresses color pigment genes, shifting the dark brown to black &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin#Eumelanin"&gt;eumelanin&lt;/a&gt; pigments to the reddish to yellow &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin#Pheomelanin"&gt;pheomelanin&lt;/a&gt; pigments.&lt;/p&gt;

A study of over 2,200 identical twins found that maternal warmth between ages 5 and 10 predicted higher levels of openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness at age 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These traits are closely tied to long-term success and well-being, suggesting even modest improvements in parenting could have widespread societal benefits.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Personality traits are strong predictors of important life outcomes, from academic and career success to health and well-being,” said Jasmin Wertz, PhD, lead author of the study and a professor of psychology at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that fostering positive parenting environments in early childhood could have a small but significant and lasting impact on the development of these crucial personality traits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wertz and her colleagues examined how maternal affection during childhood—specifically between the ages of 5 and 10—predicted the Big Five personality traits at age 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Big Five personality traits are viewed by personality psychologists as the five basic dimensions of human personality: extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness and neuroticism, or emotional stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;American Psychologist&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined data from 2,232 British identical twins (51.1% female) who were followed from birth through age 18 as part of the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twins Study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying identical twins allows researchers to control for genetic and environmental factors by comparing identical twins who grew up in the same family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study, researchers conducted home visits with the twins’ mothers and recorded them talking about each of their children. Trained observers then rated the mothers’ responses for warmth and affection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twins whose mothers expressed more warmth toward them in childhood were rated as more open, conscientious and agreeable as young adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results offer evidence that positive, affectionate mothering can affect key personality traits that are linked to success later in life, and these influences could have an impact across generations, said Wertz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that even modest changes in personality could lead to significant population-wide benefits over time, particularly in promoting conscientiousness, which is strongly associated with success in education, work and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found no lasting associations between maternal affection and extraversion or neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that other environmental or genetic factors—such as peer relationships, life experiences, and perhaps later interventions—may be more influential for these in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also underscore the importance of considering both genetic and environmental factors when designing programs aimed at promoting positive personality traits, according to Wertz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research provides valuable evidence for the potential of parenting programs to influence critical aspects of personality development,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, it also highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of how different factors, including genetics, parenting and life experiences, interact to shape who we are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wertz believes the research provides important practical considerations for policymakers and practitioners working in education, family welfare and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that conscientiousness may predict success in school and the workplace, interventions designed to enhance affectionate parenting could contribute to improving educational outcomes, mental health and social well-being on a broader scale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are many proven ways to support parents, such as policies that improve a family’s financial situation; access to treatment for parents who struggle with mental health problems such as depression; and parenting programs that help parents build stronger relationships with their children,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also sheds light on the possibility of developing parental training models to address inequalities in personality development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By targeting parenting practices that promote positive traits in childhood, it may be possible to reduce disparities in life outcomes associated with socioeconomic background, family dynamics and other environmental factors,” Wertz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#563c253a3f21371637263778392431" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;James Sliwa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://apa.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;APA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;James Sliwa – APA&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-amp0001508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Parenting in Childhood Predicts Personality in Early Adulthood: A Longitudinal Twin-Differences Study&lt;/a&gt;” by Jasmin Wertz et al. &lt;em&gt;American Psychologist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 20:58:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5mV3czRUxYRDlTVXhtMHYwaTIwdERBbU1sbElmWUpzbDhaRk04VnRPMHF4Mmt1QXZJQUY4NHRjM3ZUQkFZcVBrNmNGOGw5S2huTU1ROU05UFdJbzBwTF93alNvUW9qVE52TXNTS19zNkFtSjZM</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic与降低阿尔茨海默氏症风险相关-神经科学新闻 | Ozempic Linked to Lower Alzheimer’s Risk - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE53aG9QQXFNOFRTMzd4bVFsMXBNbkVlNHRfb1JiSGg0eXZ0MHQ5SDZzRWtxWFlDSUc4WW9ZOU9iU2ZnVVNpTzkzcThrY1puVXNkYzNjdlRhVHVrcWhwUmFITFJWTldLbndnUFB3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study suggests that two widely used Type 2 diabetes medications—GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors—may help reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Researchers analyzed Medicare data and found that patients taking these drugs had significantly lower rates of cognitive decline compared to those using other glucose-lowering medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings point to potential neuroprotective effects, even for individuals without diabetes.

As use of these drugs continues to expand, it becomes increasingly important to understand their real-world benefits and risks across populations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guo conducted this research in collaboration with William Donahoo, M.D., clinical professor and chief of the UF Health Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, and Steven T DeKosky, M.D., deputy director of the McKnight Brain Institute and professor of Alzheimer’s research, neurology and neuroscience in the UF Department of Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the study only included patients with Type 2 diabetes, Guo said next steps include evaluating the effects of the two drugs in broader populations by using recent, real-world data that captures their growing use in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Future research should focus on identifying heterogeneous treatment effects — specifically, determining which patients are most likely to benefit and who may be at greater risk for safety concerns,” Guo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuropharmacology and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1c796e757f32747d7175706873725c697a7032797869" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ufl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eric Hamilton – University of Florida&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.0353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GLP-1RA and SGLT2i Medications for Type 2 Diabetes and Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias&lt;/a&gt;” by Serena Jingchuan Guo et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GLP-1RA and SGLT2i Medications for Type 2 Diabetes and Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association between glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and risk of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) remains to be confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the risk of ADRD associated with GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This target trial emulation study used electronic health record data from OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium from January 2014 to June 2023. Patients were 50 years or older with T2D and no prior diagnosis of ADRD or antidementia treatment. Among the 396 963 eligible patients with T2D, 33 858 were included in the GLP-1RA vs other glucose-lowering drug (GLD) cohort, 34 185 in the SGLT2i vs other GLD cohort, and 24 117 in the GLP-1RA vs SGLT2i cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initiation of treatment with a GLP-1RA, SGLT2i, or other second-line GLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADRD was identified using clinical diagnosis codes.

In IPTW-weighted cohorts, the incidence rate of ADRD was lower in GLP-1RA initiators compared with other GLD initiators (rate difference [RD], −2.26 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, −2.88 to −1.64]), yielding an HR of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47-0.96). SGLT2i initiators had a lower incidence than other GLD initiators (RD, −3.05 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, −3.68 to −2.42]), yielding an HR of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.43-0.75). There was no difference between GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is, with an RD of −0.09 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, −0.80 to 0.63) and an HR of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.72-1.32).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people with T2D, both GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is were statistically significantly associated with decreased risk of ADRD compared with other GLDs, and no difference was observed between both drugs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 20:24:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE53aG9QQXFNOFRTMzd4bVFsMXBNbkVlNHRfb1JiSGg0eXZ0MHQ5SDZzRWtxWFlDSUc4WW9ZOU9iU2ZnVVNpTzkzcThrY1puVXNkYzNjdlRhVHVrcWhwUmFITFJWTldLbndnUFB3</guid></item><item><title>为什么睡前锻炼需要停止- Gizmodo | Why Your Workouts Before Bedtime Need to Stop - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNMmFDYlVWUG5EcHNPZ0dXZGNqM1V6NTRDbmk5TGlDS3p1WmNlSjVHeEZSY21acFRkdE1JLWpxejZuWHNCbE9odXBsSFNPVzJWWWNyZVlsdjBkWEJfQnFLY2NuXzlwMjdHczg5T0hUbkZHM1U2UHlVUmI3cWJyS01lU3Z3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;When work runs long, the commute home is slow, and cooking dinner takes forever (you promised yourself you’d stop ordering takeout), it’s normal to try to squeeze in a quick workout before crashing. Better than not exercising at all, right? Unfortunately, a recent study has bad news for you: Intense workouts shortly before bedtime may negatively impact your sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After monitoring the exercise, sleep, and heart activity of 14,689 people for a year, an international team of researchers revealed that exercising within four hours of going to sleep is associated with taking longer to fall asleep, sleeping less, poorer sleep quality, along with &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/your-resting-heart-rate-can-reflect-your-current-and-future-health-201606172482"&gt;higher nocturnal resting heart rate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21773-heart-rate-variability-hrv"&gt;lower nocturnal heart rate variability&lt;/a&gt;—both of which are typically linked to health risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Intense exercise in the evening can keep the body in a heightened state of alertness, which is why public health guidelines have previously advised against working out too close to bedtime,” Josh Leota from Monash University’s School of Psychological Sciences said in a university &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/medicine/news/latest/2025-articles/exercise-before-bed-is-linked-with-disrupted-sleep-study"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While some previous studies have challenged these guidelines by suggesting that late workouts don’t always disrupt sleep, Leota claims those studies “relied on small sample sizes and laboratory settings, and rarely involved exercise bouts that elicit substantial cardiometabolic demand on the body,” he added, casting doubt on the validity of their results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To shed light on the soundness of these public health guidelines, Leota and colleagues conducted a new &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58271-x"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. The team monitored the 14,689 study participants with multi-sensor biometric devices and gathered four million nights’ worth of data to investigate the potential association between late workouts, exercise intensity, sleep, and heart activity during sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their analyses of the data accounted for age, gender, season, weekday, fitness levels, and how participants had slept the night before. The results link a late, strenuous workout to the aforementioned signs of impaired sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Evening exercise—particularly involving high levels of cardiovascular strain—may disrupt subsequent sleep, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability, thereby impairing a critical stage of the recovery process,” said Elise Facer-Childs, senior author of the study also from Monash University School of Psychological Sciences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Workouts considered “strenuous” were exercises that caused persistently elevated respiratory rates, heart rate, core body temperature, and mental alertness, like high-intensity interval training, long runs, or football games. So “if exercising within a four-hour window of bedtime, people could choose brief low intensity exercises, such as a light jog or swim, to minimize sleep disruption and allow the body to wind down,” Leota added.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The study ultimately holds important implications for sleep health, shedding light on how late night workouts impact crucial shut-eye and empowering individuals to get the best rest they can.&lt;/p&gt;

I often recommend that documentary to my patients who are newly diagnosed with Alzheimer’s or dementia—it helps them understand the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That experience prompted Winegar to research the topic more deeply. While music therapy dates back some 20,000 years, when shamans used ritualistic drumming to ward off disease, Winegar discovered just how effective music can be as a complementary treatment for a range of conditions, including dementia, chronic pain, developmental delays and heart rate regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She partnered with colleague Dustin Hixenbaugh, a professor at San Jacinto College in Pasadena, Texas, to coauthor “Prescribing Music as an Adjunctive Treatment,” published in the March 2025 edition of &lt;em&gt;The Journal for Nurse Practitioners&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Music delays neurodegeneration in conditions such as Alzheimer’s,” Winegar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes, patients with memory issues get anxious and upset, which can start affecting their speech and ability to communicate. But if they’re able to sing, they can express their feelings, which helps reduce anxiety, stress and depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winegar described two types of music therapy: active, which involves playing an instrument or singing, and passive, which involves simply listening. Both can be beneficial in different situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A military veteran who served from 1987-2003, Winegar recalls how music helped calm her nerves or gave her a needed boost during a difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re running with music playing, it can push you to keep going,” Winegar said. “In a clinical setting, patients dealing with Parkinson’s disease and other movement disorders can improve their walking cadence and frequency just by listening to music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In neurology, music has been shown to decrease seizure activity by calming abnormal electrical impulses in the brain. Research also shows that music can regulate heart rate and blood pressure by reducing overexcitation in the nervous system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the most beneficial types of music, Winegar said it depends entirely on the person. Someone might find heavy metal more calming than country music, or vice versa. Personal preference is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winegar, a country music fan herself, organized her presentation of this research around the genre when she shared her findings at the International Country Music Conference in Nashville last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We focused on how country music can be used in a clinical setting,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It often tells the stories of struggle—my wife left me, I’m an alcoholic, my truck won’t start. We framed our presentation around the idea that music can serve as a support group, helping people connect with others facing similar struggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the end of the day, music is a powerful tool,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t cost anything to turn on the radio, and it can be there for you during rough patches—whether you’re feeling anxious, depressed or in pain. It can motivate you, help you exercise or provide comfort. Music has always been there for us. That’s the most important takeaway from this research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this music and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cda9bfa8bae3a9acbba4bea2a38db8b9ace3a8a9b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Drew Davison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uta.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UT Arlington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Drew Davison – UT Arlington&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nurpra.2025.105349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prescribing Music as an Adjunctive Treatment&lt;/a&gt;” by Rhonda Winegar et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal for Nurse Practitioners&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prescribing Music as an Adjunctive Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nurse practitioners are vital in delivering holistic patient care, and integrating music therapy can significantly benefit individuals with various medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognized for promoting physical, emotional, and behavioral rehabilitation, music therapy helps reduce stress and anxiety, regulate physiologic indicators such as blood pressure, and alleviate pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its positive effects extend beyond comfort, making it a valuable complement to standard treatments. Financial considerations, including session costs and inconsistent insurance coverage, can impact access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategies such as sliding scale fees and community resources enhance affordability, making it essential for health care providers to advocate for patient access to this effective therapeutic option.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 20:01:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE43VFhwYXdjYUdrbHBvZnJvOERfWC1WcWJGYkk0Q214WC1MYzJXQmZQTHlNbzEtZ01WZE4tNFAxYm95NnMteXdFZXpNQm9PclNzQ29ENTAtZFprMFdXbGRDb21yS1RQOFRra2hFWQ</guid></item><item><title>金色的眼睛：金纳米颗粒有朝一日如何帮助恢复人们的视力- Phys.org | Golden eyes: How gold nanoparticles may one day help to restore people's vision - Phys.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTFBtbEFPUXZiMTRRazZBT1FkQk4yWGlVcWYwSi1TT1hMZG1XNG05UHhLS0pld0J5OHlYS0QzT3dLSjBGRlA4YlZpMDZmVldyMFk2U0plNWVzYnRjOE1IcWZuLXp3RzdBbk1SX29ENzB0YklNQnNNV2JRRdIBd0FVX3lxTE5vV0RmVmx5UmV5S0pRUVlOaEdQZXFybUxlMGpFMmx1VnlfdnlmdDlTRmxDLU9PRmVpU09zdy0xd2dNckd3OXVVelRNXzgtd2YwY1E3X0NnTjlKSFl0cldwX2Q4WkNKcWlhTXNmZjJ1M1ZDM0pGWlMw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study by Brown University researchers suggests that gold nanoparticles—microscopic bits of gold thousands of times thinner than a human hair—might one day be used to help restore vision in people with macular degeneration and other retinal disorders.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;In a study &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.4c14061" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/i&gt;, the research team showed that nanoparticles injected into the retina can successfully stimulate the visual system and restore vision in mice with retinal disorders. The findings suggest that a new type of visual prosthesis system in which nanoparticles, used in combination with a small laser device worn in a pair of glasses or goggles, might one day help people with retinal disorders to see again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a new type of retinal prosthesis that has the potential to restore vision lost to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/retinal+degeneration/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;retinal degeneration&lt;/a&gt; without requiring any kind of complicated surgery or &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/genetic+modification/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic modification&lt;/a&gt;," said Jiarui Nie, a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institutes of Health who led the research while completing her Ph.D. at Brown. "We believe this technique could potentially transform treatment paradigms for retinal degenerative conditions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nie performed the work while working in the lab of Jonghwan Lee, an associate professor in Brown's School of Engineering and a faculty affiliate at Brown's Carney Institute for Brain Science, who oversaw the work and served as the study's senior author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retinal disorders like &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/macular+degeneration/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;macular degeneration&lt;/a&gt; and retinitis pigmentosa affect millions of people in the U.S. and around the world. These conditions damage &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/light-sensitive+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;light-sensitive cells&lt;/a&gt; in the retina called photoreceptors—the "rods" and "cones" that convert light into tiny electric pulses. Those pulses stimulate other types of cells further up the visual chain called bipolar and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/ganglion+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;ganglion cells&lt;/a&gt;, which process the photoreceptor signals and send them along to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;This new approach uses nanoparticles injected directly into the retina to bypass damaged photoreceptors. When &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/infrared+light/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;infrared light&lt;/a&gt; is focused on the nanoparticles, they generate a tiny amount of heat that activates bipolar and ganglion cells in much the same way that photoreceptor pulses do. Because disorders like macular degeneration affect mostly photoreceptors while leaving bipolar and ganglion cells intact, the strategy has the potential to restore lost vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this new study, the research team tested the nanoparticle approach in mouse retinas and in living mice with retinal disorders. After injecting a liquid nanoparticle solution, the researchers used patterned near-infrared laser light to project shapes onto the retinas. Using a calcium signal to detect cellular activity, the team confirmed that the nanoparticles were exciting bipolar and ganglion cells in patterns matched the shapes projected by the laser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiments showed that neither the nanoparticle solution nor the laser stimulation caused detectable adverse side effects, as indicated by metabolic markers for inflammation and toxicity. Using probes, the researchers confirmed that laser stimulation of the nanoparticles caused increased activity in the visual cortices of the mice—an indication that previously absent visual signals were being transmitted and processed by the brain. That, the researchers say, is a sign that vision had been at least partially restored, a good sign for potentially translating a similar technology to humans.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;For human use, the researchers envision a system that combines the nanoparticles with a laser system mounted in a pair of glasses or goggles. Cameras in the goggles would gather &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/image+data/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;image data&lt;/a&gt; from the outside world and use it to drive the patterning of an infrared laser. The laser pulses would then stimulate the nanoparticles in people's retinas, enabling them to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach is similar to one that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for human use a few years ago. The older approach combined a camera system with a small electrode array that was surgically implanted in the eye. The nanoparticle approach has several key advantages, according to Nie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, it's far less invasive. As opposed to surgery, "an intravitreal injection is one of the simplest procedures in ophthalmology," Nie said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are functional advantages as well. The resolution of the previous approach was limited by the size of the electrode array—about 60 square pixels. Because the nanoparticle solution covers the whole retina, the new approach could potentially cover someone's full field of vision. And because the nanoparticles respond to near-infrared light as opposed to visual light, the system doesn't necessarily interfere with any residual vision a person may retain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More work must be done before the approach can be tried in a clinical setting, Nie said, but this early research suggests that it's possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We showed that the nanoparticles can stay in the retina for months with no major toxicity," Nie said of the research. "And we showed that they can successfully stimulate the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/visual+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;visual system&lt;/a&gt;. That's very encouraging for future applications."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balance is so fundamental that we often take it for granted, but its importance goes far beyond just keeping us upright. In fact, recent studies have shown that the ability to stand on one leg may be one of the best physical indicators of overall health and longevity. What's more, it's a test we can all do at home.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;One widely reported study, published in 2022 in the &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/17/975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, found that the inability to hold this position for at least 10 seconds was associated with a two-fold increased risk of death in people aged 50 and over. After assessing 1,702 individuals aged 51–75, the study's authors found that those who failed the test had a significantly higher mortality rate over the 7-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more recent &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-what-standing-on-one-leg-can-tell-you/" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic study&lt;/a&gt; of 40 healthy adults over the age of 50 confirmed these findings. According to their conclusions, &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310764" target="_blank"&gt;published in October 2024 in the journal &lt;i&gt;PLOS One&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to balance on one leg (especially the non-dominant leg) not only declines significantly with age, but is the best indicator of neuromuscular aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, other parameters such as gait, grip &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/strength/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; or leg strength have been used to measure aging. However, it is now certain that balance is the factor most affected by age, with significant changes in each decade of life.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;How we stay upright&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to keep our balance while standing on one foot, the brain needs to receive information about the body's orientation and position in space. We also have to generate the right muscle contractions in order to maintain posture, and coordinate our muscles to prevent us from falling over. All of this requires a healthy nervous system that can react quickly to small changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balance depends on multiple systems. While vision provides information about position and environment, the inner ear detects changes in head position and supplements visual signals. The proprioceptive system, which tells us where our limbs are, gives information about &lt;a href="https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=9235637" target="_blank"&gt;joint position&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/weight+distribution/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;weight distribution&lt;/a&gt; on the sole of the foot, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/muscle+tone/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;muscle tone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these systems send information about the position of our body to the brain, which in turn triggers an automatic response to correct imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scielo.isciii.es/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;amp;pid=S1134-928X2010000300002" target="_blank"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt; have highlighted the importance of muscle strength, especially in older people. Decreased muscle strength and coordination can lead to an increased risk of falls and injuries as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these systems deteriorate as we age, affecting our ability to maintain balance. Conditions such as obesity, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, hypertension and type 2 diabetes can also &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/17/975" target="_blank"&gt;compromise our balance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;How to exercise your balance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, balance is something you can improve with practice, through exercises as simple as standing on one leg, walking in a straight line, or walking or standing on unstable surfaces. It is also essential to maintain adequate muscle strength. Yoga and tai chi, for instance, are both excellent ways to improve stability and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+fitness/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical fitness&lt;/a&gt; is a case of "use it or lose it." Lack of exercise and various bodily stimuli can lead to a decrease in muscle strength, flexibility and balance. Maintaining an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/exercise+routine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;exercise routine&lt;/a&gt; is crucial to preserving these abilities and preventing physical deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to balance on one leg is a proven, valuable indicator of health and longevity. Incorporating balance exercises into your daily routine can help you to improve stability, reduce the risk of falls and, more generally, age healthily.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="source__text" data-editable="source"&gt;CNN&lt;/span&gt;
         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7cizg005826p1fezy5mp0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Centers and Disease Control and Prevention is considering recommending annual Covid-19 shots to those who are older or who have compromised immune function, rather than the current blanket recommendation for everyone 6 months of age and older.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay00042e6be4kk0eoi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The change would more closely align the US with guidance given in other countries. Unlike countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, the US alone recommends an annual Covid-19 vaccine for healthy younger adults and children. The World Health Organization also doesn’t routinely recommend annual Covid-19 vaccines for healthy adults under 65 or healthy children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay00052e6b91759y1i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Monday, a panel of independent experts that advises the CDC on its vaccine recommendations, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, weighed the pros and cons of moving the US away from a blanket recommendation that most people get an updated Covid-19 shot every year and toward a more nuanced, risk-based recommendation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay00062e6buvwmb2aj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Members of the Covid-19 vaccine work group said they began studying the policy change in November.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay00072e6bjmqxbakc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under a risk-based recommendation, the CDC would continue to recommend two doses of Covid-19 vaccines each year for older adults — those over 65 — and to anyone with weakened immune function.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay00082e6b84kr6x6p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It may also consider recommending annual vaccination for adults and children who are at high risk of Covid-19 disease because they have a higher risk of being exposed to it. Those groups could include people like health-care workers or children in day care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay00092e6bh19oyn32@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There was also strong support for a statement in the recommendation to say that anyone who wanted to get a Covid-19 vaccine could still get one, even if they didn’t fit into a higher-risk category.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000a2e6bh79jsqhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A risk-based recommendation would be more complicated to communicate to the public and potentially trickier to implement than a universal recommendation, and some members of the full committee said they’d be against it for that reason.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000b2e6bjzum7ftd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I guess I’m surprised that we’re considering a risk-based recommendation, which in general, we have not had a lot of success with implementing in the US,” said committee member Dr. Denise Jamieson, dean of the Carver College of Medicine at the University of Iowa.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000c2e6b2jnrtsrk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jamieson said she also worried that some people could lose insurance coverage for their Covid-19 vaccines if the recommendation was softened for some groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000d2e6bdrw806ne@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also not clear where the committee might land on underlying health conditions and who would be considered at higher risk based on a pre-existing condition, such as diabetes or heart or lung diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000e2e6bliy3xva2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An analysis of data based on the CDC’s list of conditions that increase the risk for severe disease from a Covid-19 infection found that 74% of adults have at least one health condition that puts them at risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000f2e6b12xb8spn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And even though Covid is no longer causing the same kind of punishing waves of illness and death as it once did, it was still the 10th leading cause of death among adults in 2023. From September 2023 through August 2024, it caused roughly 40,000 deaths in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000g2e6b1b4d8h70@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Covid is still a fairly dangerous disease and very, very common,” said committee member Dr. Jamie Loehr, who runs a family practice clinic in Ithaca, New York.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000h2e6b4k3tet51@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Loehr said he wondered how feasible it might be to implement a risk-based recommendation and what message it might send to the public.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000i2e6bjamg61vr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even though I’m in favor of a risk-based recommendation, I still have my hesitations,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000j2e6bbhzepv52@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Others worried that exempting healthy adults might make long Covid more common. Studies have shown that vaccination cuts the risk of developing the condition, which affected more than 9 million adults and children in 2023, according to national surveys.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000k2e6bikp42vvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What I would like to see is modeling around long Covid,” said committee member Dr. Oliver Brooks, the chief medical officer of Watts Healthcare Corp. in Los Angeles. “My primary concern through all of this at this point is long Covid.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000l2e6b38reoyvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though there was concern that risk-based recommendations would decrease vaccination, others pointed out there’s no proof that’s true.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000m2e6b8kawxjmo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s not clear evidence at all that risk-based approaches are less effective,” said committee member Dr. Noel Brewer, a professor of public health at the University of North Carolina. “The data supporting that claim are not really there.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000n2e6bay3qjhbl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On the whole, members of the committee who have studied the question most closely said they favored switching to risk-based recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000o2e6bmne0cvun@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As of April, more than three-quarters of the working group on the Covid-19 vaccine recommendations for this coming fall and winter favored risk-based recommendations, though they don’t plan to formally vote on the policy change until the next meeting, which is scheduled for June.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

(VVNG.com)&lt;/strong&gt; — The Apple Valley Animal Shelter has confirmed that 35 dogs have been humanely euthanized following an outbreak of Canine Distemper Disease, officials announced Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Town of Apple Valley Animal Services Department, as of April 15, 2025, ten dogs have tested positive for distemper, with an additional 14 test results still pending. Shelter officials say the difficult decision to euthanize was made for dogs diagnosed with distemper or those exhibiting neurological symptoms in order to prevent the further spread of the highly contagious and often fatal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canines that remain in the shelter and are not currently showing symptoms will continue to be closely monitored under the supervision of the shelter’s veterinary team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shelter remains closed to new canine intakes and has suspended all adoptions for a minimum of 10 to 14 days. The following enhanced safety protocols remain in effect:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;No canine adoptions or new intakes will occur during the quarantine period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All symptomatic animals are isolated and cleaned last in the daily routine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staff must wear proper personal protective equipment (PPE).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Footwear must be disinfected after exiting areas of illness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any dogs exhibiting neurological symptoms will be euthanized.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Symptomatic dogs are being tested, with priority given to those from suspected exposure or high-risk areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This has been an incredibly difficult and emotional time for our staff and volunteers,” said Adriana Atteberry, Animal Services Manager. “Our top priority is to prevent further suffering and to protect both the animals currently in our care and the broader community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials continue to urge pet owners to ensure their animals are vaccinated against preventable diseases such as distemper and parvo. Distemper often begins with cold-like symptoms that can escalate quickly, particularly in unvaccinated dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents are advised not to bring unvaccinated pets into public areas and to seek veterinary care immediately if they suspect their pet may be ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shelter said it will continue to follow all state and local health guidelines, as well as recommendations from its supervising veterinarian, and will provide updates as the situation evolves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="vvng-social-box"&gt;&lt;p&gt; 📢 Stay connected with the High Desert’s largest news community!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 🔗 For more local news, visit &lt;a href="https://www.vvng.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VVNG.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt; 💬 Join the conversation below!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related Article: &lt;a href="https://www.vvng.com/distemper-case-confirmed-at-apple-valley-animal-shelter-canine-adoptions-paused/"&gt;Distemper Case Confirmed at Apple Valley Animal Shelter; Canine Adoptions Paused&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>VVNG</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 19:01:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNak0xbjZVRTM0dE9OLVozU3BzMjNBWTNNV0lyUm1Rd2ExeDBWdVFJd294d1lrYUMtYXFhMjltX2pvbjhCVjd1LVQ4UmozUHZVZXZHM1liY1pla2tCRWN4cFBsenVoSHI3LW9xVURXcnBRVlZvSlU3elNSS1dnRFVmUEdQblpQWFh6Y25OMEZWbmpOWWo2dnpoSV9Nbw</guid></item><item><title>FAU为开创性的医学研究寻找志愿者- BocaNewsNow.com | FAU Seeks Volunteers For Groundbreaking Medical Study - BocaNewsNow.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxNSnMzMFFIS2d4WGZ1TzRnN0s0SVV6Yk0ySkZDY0hhT1U3ZVVJSm9rNFVDSFVyUXhSS05OX2dmbDB1SklsXzZiQTJCUUVZcjRkVkk2TG95MHFaeXZ2TVc1c3hkWnRzYmlLUE5QcGdkRDNCNTRHY25JM19jT0RuVTRxNVpET3pWMV8yRTB1M1czek16bm8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOCA RATON, FL (BocaNewsNow.com) (Copyright © 2025 MetroDesk Media, LLC) — Florida Atlantic University is seeking volunteers for an upcoming medical study. FAU shared the details Wednesday with &lt;a href="https://bocanewsnow.com"&gt;BocaNewsNow.com&lt;/a&gt; through this announcement: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-131" data-inserter-version="2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="bocan-ccc3b667fc5695f1961ad9bbb1c10193 bocan-content_2" id="bocan-ccc3b667fc5695f1961ad9bbb1c10193"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Florida Atlantic University is recruiting participants for an exciting research study aimed at understanding the effects of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and normal aging on cognitive performance, exercise ability and the mind-body connection. This study will compare the cognitive and exercise performance of individuals with and without PD to gain insights into mobility and cognitive function across different age groups. The primary goal is to explore the differences in cognitive and exercise performance between individuals diagnosed with PD and healthy aging controls, focusing on how aging and PD uniquely impact cognitive and physical function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="bocan-003db1b673c489c67ef06bf88dc7b858 bocan-content" id="bocan-003db1b673c489c67ef06bf88dc7b858"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To participate, individuals with PD must be 62 years of age or older, have a diagnosis of PD, and have no recent changes in PD medications. Participants should also be physically active within the community and not use assistive devices such as a cane or walker for mobility. For healthy controls, participants must be 62 years of age or older, have no neurological diagnoses, and have no recent changes in medications. They should also be physically active within the community and not use assistive devices for mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-139" data-inserter-version="2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All participants who qualify for the study will visit FAU’s Boca Raton campus for one testing session, which will last approximately one hour. During the session, participants will undergo cognitive and exercise assessments, including the Stroop test, Flanker test, Senior Fitness Test, and will complete questionnaires. Participants will be assessed on their balance and fall risk potential and will gain valuable insights into their cognitive and exercise performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our study offers a unique opportunity to contribute to advancing research that could help improve the quality of life for individuals with Parkinson’s disease, providing valuable insights into more effective treatments,” said B. Sue Graves, Ed.D., principal investigator and an associate professor in the Department of Exercise Science and Health Promotion within the FAU Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. “Additionally, it enhances our understanding of healthy aging, which is critical for developing strategies that promote well-being throughout the lifespan.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more information, email sgraves@fau.edu or call 954-675-5782. &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140" data-inserter-version="2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;After people started testing positive for hepatitis C in a coastal Florida town in December, state officials collected blood from patients, wrapped their specimens in dry ice and mailed them straight to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Ga.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The hepatitis C virus, which is spread through contact with infected blood and can lead to deadly liver cancer, is notoriously hard to identify. But if anyone could understand what was happening in Florida, it would be the Division of Viral Hepatitis in the CDC's headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Using samples from the laboratory's collection of nearly 1 million frozen specimens, scientists helped make the initial discovery of the hepatitis C virus in the 1980s. In 2020, that research was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The scientists at the lab knew what they were doing. Quickly, they analyzed the blood from Florida using their custom software and found that nine cases were genetically linked to the same pain clinic, where it was later discovered that a doctor was improperly reusing injection vials. By March, officials in Florida had restricted the doctor's medical license to limit the spread of the virus and packaged new patient samples to send to the CDC for testing, CDC employees told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But on April 1, the outbreak investigation was brought to a halt. All 27 of the lab's scientists received an email from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services informing them that they were losing their jobs. Like &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/01/g-s1-57485/hhs-fda-layoffs-doge-cdc-nih" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;thousands of other employees&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who received similar emails that day, the scientists were told they would be placed on administrative leave until June 2, after which they would no longer work for the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The email said their duties were "identified as either unnecessary or virtually identical to duties being performed elsewhere in the agency." But the kind of genetic tracing that the CDC's lab performs is not conducted by any other lab in the United States or the world, experts interviewed by NPR said. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the lab remains shuttered, ongoing investigations of current hepatitis outbreaks have been stalled, not just in Florida, but also in Oregon, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Wisconsin, West Virginia and Georgia, according to CDC employees who work closely with the Division of Viral Hepatitis. The five CDC employees NPR spoke with requested that their names not be shared for fear of retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Scientists who specialize in infectious disease told NPR that the lab's closure puts Americans at a higher risk of contracting viral infections in the future.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"More people get sick, or you don't recognize outbreaks at all, and they just continue to spread unchecked," said the Director of Infectious Disease Programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, Kelly Wroblewski. "That's the ultimate risk."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Although four new samples have already arrived at the lab and three more were waiting in Florida to be sent, none have been tested by the CDC, scientists at the CDC said. Epidemiologists still working at the CDC have been trying to find another place that can do the analysis but have been unsuccessful, an agency employee told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Commercial laboratories do not do this because it's not profitable," said the employee. "That's why no one really does it except for us."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without the CDC's scientists available to test the genetic material in patient samples, it will be harder for epidemiologists to confirm whether people with hepatitis C were infected in the same Florida doctor's office or somewhere else where the virus could still be spreading, CDC scientists said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We won't know whether there are other linked cases in this clinic," said a CDC scientist. "There could potentially be hundreds more people that have been infected with hepatitis C and not know it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR requested an interview with the Florida Department of Health but representatives there did not respond. When NPR reached out to the CDC to request an interview to discuss the status of the Division of Viral Hepatitis lab, a representative referred reporters to an HHS form for requesting comment. As of publication, HHS has not responded to six questions NPR asked through the form.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Two days after the lab's scientists received their reduction in force emails, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. acknowledged that about a fifth of the cuts at HHS &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/05/g-s1-58312/hhs-layoffs-rif-cdc-fda-nih" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;were made unintentionally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and some people would be offered their jobs back.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We're reinstating them," Kennedy told reporters on April 3. "We're going to do 80 percent cuts, but 20 percent of those are going to have to be reinstalled, because we'll make mistakes."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;On April 4, the Association of Public Health Laboratories sent a letter to Kennedy urging HHS to reinstate all personnel in the Division of Viral Hepatitis and at the Division of STD Prevention, another lab at the CDC that was also shuttered.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The [Division of Viral Hepatitis] Laboratory Branch had the highest degree of viral hepatitis expertise of any public health laboratory in the world," wrote Scott Becker, the association's CEO. "Their loss eliminated critical national testing services that do not exist anywhere else within the HHS agencies."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As of April 16, the association had not received a response from Kennedy, Becker said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60574" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, most often caused by one of five different viruses. The disease sickens and kills tens of thousands of Americans every year. In 2022, there were more than 85,000 estimated viral hepatitis infections in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, the latest &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-surveillance-2022/about/index.html#cdc_survey_profile_key_findings-key-findings" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;surveillance data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows. More than 14,500 people are known to have died from the infections in 2022. That number does not include patients who might have died from related complications, like long-term liver disease, without knowing the cause could have been a hepatitis infection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Viral hepatitis is often undiagnosed and underreported. For more than 30 years, the Division of Viral Hepatitis has been trying to change that, scientists said. Hepatitis samples in the lab's collection in the CDC's headquarters have been used by scientists to invent multiple vaccines and identify new viral strains. The lab's scientists have linked thousands of infections to their sources, they said, which likely prevented dozens of outbreaks from affecting far more members of the public.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because of the unique role that U.S. government labs like the Division of Viral Hepatitis play in disease detection and prevention, they rarely shut down. If a single scientist is expected to leave or retire, the lab creates an elaborate plan to transition their work to someone else who can continue it, said a CDC scientist. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But after employees were told their jobs were no longer needed on April 1, they were also informed they had just one day to close down the lab, scientists at the lab told NPR. Relocating around a million samples in a day would be virtually impossible, the scientists said. The samples are kept in more than 50 freezers maintained at different temperatures, ranging from -80 degrees to -20 degrees. Since the lab has no other freezer space outside the CDC where they could transfer the specimens, they're still at the CDC for now, scientists said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Nothing has been shut down correctly," said a CDC employee. "These aren't pieces of equipment you can just unplug."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The lab's computer genomic analysis program – called the Global Hepatitis Outbreak and Surveillance Technology, or GHOST – is also in limbo. That's the program that allowed scientists to link the genetic information from patients in Florida to the doctor's office where the infections spread. More than 20 other states access the CDC's GHOST technology remotely by uploading their own samples directly to the program. But the system, which was built with help from a more than $6 million dollar allocation from Congress, is not fully remote. To function correctly, and to allow the program to keep improving itself with artificial intelligence, it requires frequent in-person maintenance by scientists working at high-end computer stations located at the CDC, said four CDC employees who work with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If we don't have the experts behind it, we're not going to be able to use it," said a health worker at the CDC involved with the Florida outbreak investigation. "Something will happen and it will glitch and it will go down. If this happens, it's going to take decades to come back from that, and that's devastating not just to us, but to the American people."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Scientists have been trying to go into the lab to prevent the GHOST program from shutting down, CDC employees told NPR, even though their jobs have not been reinstated. But communication about access to the lab has been inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Shortly after they were told to pack up their materials in one day, the scientists were informed that they could keep entering the lab through April 11. A few returned to find some of the lab's equipment already malfunctioning. Soon after, the scientists heard they could retain access to the lab through April 25. But that access has not always been granted immediately. Multiple scientists who tried to enter CDC headquarters on April 14 were initially turned away due to issues with their key cards, two CDC employees told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Expensive equipment and irreplaceable specimens could be permanently lost if scientists cannot keep working in the lab, CDC employees said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You have to do certain things to make sure they're set up for long-term pauses," said a CDC scientist. "That's millions of dollars worth of equipment if they're not shut down correctly."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When functioning properly, the lab can also respond to unexpected public health emergencies. For almost a year, starting in April 2020, the Division of Viral Hepatitis tested specimens from people infected with the novel COVID-19 virus to better understand it. The lab generated some of the first data on the prevalence of COVID-19 across the U.S., workers told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We were there during the pandemic when everyone was afraid and we didn't know anything about COVID," said one CDC scientist. "And now we're thrown out, just like that."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In interviews with NPR, four scientists who worked in the lab said they and their colleagues are hoping they'll be able to return to keep doing their work at the Division of Viral Hepatitis, which they said saves American lives.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Everyone is saying that this seems to be a mistake," said a CDC scientist. "If they knew the impact of these programs, they would never do this."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="hr"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have information about health projects that have been halted or any other story tips, you can send an email to the reporter of this article at eisnerchiara@proton.me.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the American Cancer Society, colon cancer impacts more than 100,000 Americans every year.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s important to incorporate healthy foods into your routine that may mitigate your risk of colorectal cancer, and there are a variety of fruits that could help with that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/thestomachdoc/?hl=en" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Joseph Salhab, D.O.&lt;/a&gt;, took to Instagram to share some of his favorite fruits that have been shown to reduce colon cancer risk, per a 2023 study published in the &lt;em&gt;World Journal of Gastroenterology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Here are some of the fruits he suggests to stock up on—plus some recipes to try featuring the gut-friendly produce.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-watermelon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Watermelon &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-watermelon-good-for-you-8680366" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Watermelon&lt;/a&gt; isn’t just delicious; according to recent data, regular intake of the fruit may also lower your risk of colon cancer by 26%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The gastroenterologist highly recommends summer’s favorite fruit because it “contains lycopene, an antioxidant that may protect against cell damage.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As Salhab points out, antioxidant-rich watermelon is ultra-hydrating, and staying hydrated can support your gut health and keep you regular. Enjoy it savory in a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/272847/watermelon-cucumber-feta-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Watermelon, Cucumber &amp;amp; Feta Salad&lt;/a&gt; or embrace its sweetness in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8067510/no-churn-watermelon-ice-cream/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;No-Churn Watermelon Ice Cream&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; An apple a day could potentially keep the doctor away, thanks to its nutrient density. Apples are packed with gut-healthy fiber, and a higher intake of the fruit can reduce colon cancer risk by 25%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, apples contain polyphenols, which Salhab notes have “antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Apples are easy to pack and delicious as-is, but they’re also great in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8004437/kale-quinoa-apple-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;salads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8070441/apple-pie-overnight-oats/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;overnight oats&lt;/a&gt; or when paired with peanut butter for a fiber- and protein-packed bite.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Providing a 13% reduction in colorectal cancer risk, Salhab says that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-kiwi-8650515" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;kiwi&lt;/a&gt; is an “excellent source of fiber, aiding in digestive health.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The vibrant, tangy fruit is also rich in vitamin C, which can help support your immune system, heart health and skin health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kiwis make a great addition to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7996799/easy-fruit-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fruit salads&lt;/a&gt; and yogurt-granola bowls, but they can also be spotlighted in savory recipes, like in these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/275029/easy-fish-tacos-with-kiwi-salsa/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Easy Fish Tacos with Kiwi Salsa&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a variety of citrus fruits, like oranges, grapefruits, lemons, limes and tangerines, can be a key factor to lowering the risk of colon cancer, with data showing a higher intake of these fruits may reduce risk by 9%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The gastroenterologist states that citrus fruits are “rich in vitamin C, an antioxidant that can neutralize free radicals, potentially reducing DNA damage.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Citrus fruits also contain flavonoids, a class of polyphenols that can &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8048742/eating-these-foods-daily-might-help-reduce-the-risk-of-frailty-by-20-a-recent-study-suggests/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;aid healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;, fight inflammation and may reduce cancer risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Ring in warmer weather and support your gut health by making a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8027229/citrus-salad-with-pomegranate-mint/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Citrus Salad with Pomegranate &amp;amp; Mint&lt;/a&gt; or a zero-waste &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/orange-peel-smoothie-8788182" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Orange Peel Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking to support your gut health, increasing your intake of fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts can help. Per recent research, watermelon, apple, kiwi and citrus fruits specifically can help lower your colon cancer risk. Talk to your doctor or dietitian for a more personalized plan to help maintain a gut-healthy eating pattern.
&lt;/p&gt;

And with the added benefits of being a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/protein-for-vegetarians" target="_blank"&gt;vegetarian protein&lt;/a&gt; and filled with &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/hair-health-nutrition" target="_blank"&gt;hair-strengthening nutrients&lt;/a&gt;? Well, count us in—or in this case, picking up some brewer’s yeast at our next stop by the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of brewer’s yeast have been known for millennia and rival hair-growing supplements like &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/biotin-hair-loss" target="_blank"&gt;biotin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/folic-acid-101" target="_blank"&gt;folic acid&lt;/a&gt;. From a technical point of view, brewer’s yeast is a collection of microscopic, nonpathogenic unicellular fungi known by the scientific name &lt;em&gt;saccharomyces cerevisiae,&lt;/em&gt; which can be used in an active or inactive form. In the former case, the microorganisms are alive and take care of the intestinal flora, while in the latter, high-temperature drying has caused the brewer’s yeast to lose its fermentative power, becoming ultra-potent when it comes to skin and hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The properties of brewer’s yeast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of brewer’s yeast (and its cousin, nutritional yeast) are mainly related to its very high content of B vitamins, which are essential to the body and nervous system. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;vitamin B1 (thiamine) to combat fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;vitamin B2 (riboflamine) to promote the assimilation of micronutrients&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;vitamin B3 (niacin) for energy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;vitamin B5, known as the anti-stress vitamin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;vitamin B6 to stimulate keratin synthesis and hair growth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;vitamin B8 (biotin) for essential for healthy skin, nails and hair&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;vitamin B9 (folic acid)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;vitamin B12, to protect against cellular aging&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with vitamins, brewer’s yeast is also an incredible source of protein and trace minerals like &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/zinc-for-skin" target="_blank"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt;, which help with immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to use brewer’s yeast to strengthen hair&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to get the benefits of brewer’s yeast for hair is to take a supplement. With precise, consistent and continuous intake, you can achieve visible results in terms of stronger, healthier and shinier hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/contributor/arden-fanning" target="_blank"&gt;Arden Fanning Andrews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt; beauty editor at large, also loves it sprinkled on her popcorn for a snack: “I start with a 15-pound bag of Amish Rainbow Popcorn because I like to imagine they don’t use pesticides, pop it on the stove in a big pot with organic extra virgin olive oil (turn the stove off when you start to hear the pops space out to a couple of seconds), then sprinkle on &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Bragg-Premium-Nutritional-Yeast-Seasoning/dp/B09HJNL75R" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2rQwPprcmtWkDQzAXaTroH5SW8SqZJtnymGg22ctthYuTeZm17ZwWGkcr1UP7uZHgQhosWJULnnRmAjg8rJbQfASGTN4gjbWriHiyYF4onsKEy2JpTmisB37hDkVmhv3AvY3DzsPuZi8YSRM3ajCGpVHZevheJPr9fGFAuy8c2KDpr4RiS3mRpwAJHvRedu4w"}' href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2rQwPprcmtWkDQzAXaTroH5SW8SqZJtnymGg22ctthYuTeZm17ZwWGkcr1UP7uZHgQhosWJULnnRmAjg8rJbQfASGTN4gjbWriHiyYF4onsKEy2JpTmisB37hDkVmhv3AvY3DzsPuZi8YSRM3ajCGpVHZevheJPr9fGFAuy8c2KDpr4RiS3mRpwAJHvRedu4w" rel="sponsored" target="_blank"&gt;Bragg Nutritional Yeast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZPBPFX4" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZPBPFX4"}' href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZPBPFX4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;powder bone broth,&lt;/a&gt; any organic spices like oregano or dill in the cabinet, and if you're feeling really daring, Tajin makes it so good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 17:20:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiVkFVX3lxTE10WUJ6V3otTHhoT203eVNBTFlpLWVmS3BDS291TzBOc192RjZjeXRfOE05VUp2N0hEd1pXVFV3QklXdXlhNV9mSWZYaVdIczI1VTVkLUpR</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心官员表示，肆虐爆发的每例麻疹病例成本高达50,000美元- Ars Technica | Each measles case in raging outbreak costs up to $50,000, CDC official says - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxOejJsX3YxY2tjWXFlblpiLTg4dlJyM0h6VDdQSC1LY2MycDVQM1JHY0RqU0dONUhXRmdzQ3FfOFZSekI0QndyaFBjNTZqS1duZWo2blYxZVB3bmlDTU1ndmp2V1pYd3dKZTdzTmt2bEhoMU1kQmxTbUtXVjFXOVItYXh2RjQ1bm5pR1FfUFJtYkdZSVNZandsZ0dka2xwS2V5bWRBa1M4d1VKYVZUdnA0aUR3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;In now-rarified comments from experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency official on Tuesday evening said the explosive measles outbreak mushrooming out of West Texas will require "significant financial resources" to control and that the agency is already struggling to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are scrapping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions," said David Sugerman, the CDC's lead on its measles team. The agency has been devastated by &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/rfk-jr-s-bloodbath-at-hhs-blowback-grows-as-losses-become-clearer/"&gt;brutal cuts to CDC staff&lt;/a&gt; and funding, including &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/cdc-rocked-by-top-level-departures-loss-of-11-4b-in-covid-funding/"&gt;a clawback of more than $11 billion&lt;/a&gt; in public health funds that largely went to state health departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugerman noted that the response to measles outbreaks is generally expensive. "The estimates are that each measles cases can be $30,000 to $50,000 for public health response work—and that adds up quite quickly." The costs go to various responses, including on-the-ground response teams, vaccine doses and vaccination clinics, case reporting, contact tracing, mitigation plans, infection prevention, data systems, and other technical assistance to state health departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, the CDC would provide media briefings and other public comments on the responses to such an extraordinarily large and fast-moving outbreak. However, Sugerman's comments are among the first publicly made by CDC experts under the current administration. He spoke about the outbreak at the very end of an all-day, public meeting of the agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which discussed a broad range of vaccine and vaccine-preventable diseases over the course of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was initially planned for February, but was abruptly canceled and then rescheduled upon the Trump administration coming into office, including the new health secretary and longtime anti-vaccine advocate, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. But, despite concern for ACIP's future, the meeting proceeded more or less as usual on Tuesday and continues today with additional topics. The last 30 minutes of yesterday's agenda was set aside for an update on the measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I find it absolutely devastating that we're having this update today," ACIP chair Keipp Talbot said at the outset of Sugerman's update. "There's no reason why we have healthy children dying of measles in the US when this vaccine is amazing," Talbot said, referencing the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. "It's highly effective and has very long-lasting immunity." Two doses of MMR offer 97 percent protection against the virus, which is among the most infectious viruses known.&lt;/p&gt;

"In adults aged &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;65 or older&lt;/a&gt;, it went up 27 times."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These trends seem to be capturing major shifts in cannabis use and potential adverse effects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cannabis use does not come "without harm," although it's legal in many places, according to the researcher.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of older adults with an ER visit or hospitalization who later received &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a dementia diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; was "also surprisingly high," he said, at 5% at five years and 19% at 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One limitation to the study was that the researchers lacked details on patterns of cannabis use and other &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;health behaviors&lt;/a&gt;, like smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result, part of the observed increase in risk is likely related to differences in behaviors between groups that we couldn’t account for," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cannabis use is associated with "short-term memory impairment and long-term changes in brain structure," according to ICES.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also only examined the risk of dementia for individuals whose cannabis use led to an &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;emergency visit or hospitalization&lt;/a&gt; — this is a small and higher-risk subset of all cannabis users and doesn’t tell us about the potential risks of differing patterns of cannabis use," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As medical and recreational cannabis use is now legal in many areas, Myran emphasized that it doesn’t mean it’s "without harm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like alcohol and other substances, cannabis use – especially regular cannabis use or use of higher-strength products – may come with important risks," he cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that regular cannabis use may have negative impacts on &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; and memory."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="article-meta"&gt;&lt;div class="author-bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angelica Stabile is a lifestyle reporter for Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fox News</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 17:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPZkh1ZDhFZmQ2MHkycEhoeVdqZWp2Y0REUzIxeWl6aHQ3ZzY4RklxUDVNbWJfTkFzMW5LODNnN1JXLWVvNmFQTlNmS2htN04xVVItdERWamx5c2xBRHk1S3JWcWtldHBlUWY5VndUMjBoa3RNaGJmT0VHeklXaTlhQnhZdkFWMkV3ckRaanFkejQ3YngyWGJ6WmowcWZFeVHSAaQBQVVfeXFMTWR1VTc4WWdXY044c2JHQjJyQ0Z5MXFEVl9yRWlWMURvdHUtUHRKMjRXRlhjSGpHSk5LSTJtSGJkd3NLZWc3NktWOTA5R1dHWURvRUtsMkhuLTJnOWdpVXZZUnEtemdkV3V2NmdzUkczS0pBY0pqRElYS0pQSGphMUozNzBoTHVqb3BHS2xNZXEtWjA2ZGdKa3lJaXFTcXE2VHhxT0I</guid></item><item><title>婚姻忠告：我妻子指责我对她不忠。原因真的很疯狂。-石板 | Marriage advice: My wife accused me of cheating on her.

We have not had penetrative sex since the onset of my problem.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9k0nptm002e3b73m0bu8hub@published"&gt;Within the last few months, I have been completely unable to get an erection around her, yet when I view porn or feel like masturbating, things come roaring back to life. She found me masturbating to porn the other day, and as soon I realized she was there, I went limp.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9k5nkxi00413b73pn75ku05@published"&gt;My wife saw what I had been doing and accused me of cheating on her (I haven’t) because in her mind, it doesn’t make sense that I can get it up in other situations, but I can’t when we want to have sex. It makes no sense to me either and I am at a loss as to what to do. It is affecting our marriage. I don’t think I need an erectile dysfunction drug because I am able to achieve and maintain erections, just no longer with my wife. Have you ever heard of this happening before, and is there a solution?&lt;/p&gt;

I reached out to &lt;a href="https://www.moushumighose.com/copy-of-about"&gt;Moushumi Ghose, a licensed marriage and family therapist&lt;/a&gt; and in the spirit of full disclosure, the head of the most recent sexology program I completed, for some insights into how you might start that digging process yourself. Here’s what she had to suggest:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-blockquote/instances/cm9k0md8a001r3b731jvbdel2@published" class="slate-blockquote" data-word-count="521"&gt;
  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really want to just first normalize the fact that erections are a very personal thing and the fact that he is not experiencing them with his wife is actually pretty telling. Whether it has to do with his own stuff or it has to do with relationship stuff, there’s something pretty deeply psychological happening here to him that is preventing him from accessing safety, comfort, relaxation all of which are required for arousal and excitement. He’s only able to do it when he’s by himself because that’s where it’s safe. This person probably could benefit from talking to someone (couples therapy/coaching as well as individual therapy). Also a little sex education goes a long way. The individual work will be very important for him to unpack what is going on for him psychologically. From experience, some of those things he might be experiencing may be that he’s afraid of being criticized, or he may feel inadequate next to her. A lot of times people experience erectile issues when they perceive their partner on a pedestal or to be “hot” and outside of his league, so to speak. These are just some examples. Essentially erectile issues are a form of imposter syndrome. And should be dealt with care, [with] someone that can help him unpack his fear, shame and guilt in a safe environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number two, as a society we expect men to just get hard, to just experience erections spontaneously because the wind blows, but there’s so much more to it. There is much more than the physical at play. There are emotional needs, there are sensual needs, and maybe none of those are really being attended to. Obviously, it’s really hard to say without knowing all of the information. But I think it’s just a reminder that this culture is especially hard on men and certainly, men get a bad rap because so many men are hard up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And number three, porn gets a bad rap. It’s important for the couple to talk about what cheating actually is without defensiveness and without blame. In her mind, masturbating to porn is cheating. In his mind, masturbating to porn is not cheating. I have a feeling that if she were feeling appreciated, she might not care so much about masturbation and the porn. This is ultimately a couples issue, and speaking with somebody who is skilled at couples sex issues can be helpful. [They need to come] to terms together around what is infidelity, what is not infidelity. For some people emotional infidelity is almost more important than actual physical infidelities. Having some of these conversations is really important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, it really feels like this couple isn’t talking much at all, not about sex, not about their relationship, and are jumping to conclusions and blame all too easily. Having heart-to-heart conversations, sprinkled in with a little bit of sex education can do wonders. In terms of the solution, it’s going to take time but chances are if they work together on this as a team, instead of opponents constantly blaming each other, they are more likely to experience success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9k0nwfg002r3b73o4cxh2dl@published"&gt;I’m a 35-year-old single male who has lived a pretty repressed life sexually. Sure, I fooled around with people, but it was mostly oral. Intercourse felt off limits. I never allowed myself to have multiple partners or explore any other areas of my sexuality. I’d like to let myself free of these invisible shackles, if you will, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/12/sexually-inexperienced-man-sexual-liberation-virgin-experimentation-advice.html"&gt;but I feel it’s frowned upon at my age and gender.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
