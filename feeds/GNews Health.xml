            As I push my cart into my favorite grocery store, I stop and look at the shoppers — my neighbors — around me. Do they realize that nearly &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/hhs-fda-and-usda-address-health-risks-ultra-processed-foods" target="_blank"&gt;70% of the food&lt;/a&gt; available to purchase for their families is &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-health-risks-study-wellness"&gt;ultraprocessed&lt;/a&gt;? And if they did, would they know how to avoid those foods?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000k3b6nxmpsncs5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I’ve been trying to answer that question for more than two years now, as part of my beat for the CNN Wellness team. Not only does my team report on the latest lifestyle news, we also provide expert-vetted guidance on how to improve your health —  we like to say it’s “news you can use.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000l3b6nox73futj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet after reading countless studies, talking to dozens of experts and exploring all sorts of trendy apps, I still can’t help you &lt;em&gt;reliably&lt;/em&gt; avoid ultraprocessed foods, also known as UPFs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000m3b6n5fwlwser@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Come with me to the snack aisle, and I’ll explain why.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000n3b6nhcwyhjsd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As I pass by all the colorfully packaged candies, cookies and chips, my stomach starts to rumble with anticipation. Typically made of refined grains and overflowing with sugar, salt and fat, these products — which we used to call “junk foods” — are calorie-laden, nutritionally bad for us, and deliciously addictive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000o3b6ndbetrfr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The appeal of junk food hasn’t changed — in fact, experts say it’s only gotten worse as the food industry &lt;a href="https://stateofchildhoodobesity.org/sugary-drinks-and-tobacco-different-industries-same-playbook/#:~:text=According%20to%20Kelly%20Brownell%2C%20PhD%2C%20and%20Matthew,tobacco%20and%20food%20industries%20have%20decades%2Dlong%20connections." target="_blank"&gt;refined its algorithms&lt;/a&gt; to target our “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/19/health/bliss-point-addictive-food"&gt;bliss point”&lt;/a&gt; — creating the absolute &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6550161/" target="_blank"&gt;yummiest combinations&lt;/a&gt; of sugar, salt and fat to make it nearly impossible to “eat just one.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000p3b6nyhlsw0xq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Today,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;many of those same junk foods — as well as the majority of other ultraprocessed foods such as ready-to-eat meals, processed meats, instant and boxed mixes, breakfast cereals, and more — contain newly created synthetic favors, textures, dyes and preservatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000q3b6n7p1c5xnf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In fact, today’s preservatives can keep foods looking fresh and tasty for days and weeks, even years — much longer shelf lives than in your great granny’s day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000r3b6n0uuqis7u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s no doubt that the safety and convenience of such long-lasting, affordable foods has been life-changing. Today, we can make meals from our cabinets without stopping by the store for fresh ingredients or stirring sauce for hours over the stove. We have more of our precious time to spend on other pursuits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000s3b6nh4ztevfm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet it’s those preservatives and other additives, however, that can make a food ultraprocessed, according to the food classification system &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10261019/" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA,&lt;/a&gt; the most widely used definition of UPFs to date.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000t3b6nsa4ljt63@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            NOVA was &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/nutrition-and-health-the-issue-is-not-food-nor-nutrients-so-muchas-processing/0C514FC9DB264538F83D5D34A81BB10A" target="_blank"&gt;created in 2009&lt;/a&gt; by Brazilian nutritionist Carlos Augusto Monteiro,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;who coined the term “ultraprocessed.” Monteiro is an emeritus professor of nutrition and public health in the School of Public Health at Brazil’s University of São Paulo.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000u3b6nzwm5vwr7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            NOVA splits food into four categories. First are  &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/04/health/weight-loss-ultraprocessed-food-wellness"&gt;minimally processed&lt;/a&gt; foods — whole foods which we may slightly “process” by cutting (slicing up an orange or apple) and cooking (sautéing vegetables). The second group includes processed culinary items used to prepare, season and cook whole foods — think spices, herbs and oils. Group three consists of processed foods that combine groups one and two — canned or bottled veggies and fruits, salted nuts, and unpackaged, freshly baked breads are examples.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000v3b6n3uo2dcp1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Group four are ultraprocessed foods — which now make up to 53% of an American adult’s diet and 62% of foods eaten by an American child, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/07/health/ultraprocessed-food-calories-average-diet-wellness"&gt;a recent report&lt;/a&gt; by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000w3b6nrtd92o9y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to Monteiro, the products in group four contain little to no whole food. Instead, they are manufactured from “chemically manipulated &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj.q439" target="_blank"&gt;cheap ingredients&lt;/a&gt;” and often use synthetic additives to make them “edible, palatable and habit-forming.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000x3b6ngzi7wfre@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additives often used in ultraprocessed foods include preservatives to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/17/health/red-40-food-dyes-wellness"&gt;artificial colorings&lt;/a&gt;; fragrance and flavor enhancers; and anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000y3b6n26gf0jtk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No reason exists to believe that humans can fully adapt to these products,” Monteiro  cowrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj.q439" target="_blank"&gt;2024 editorial in the journal The BMJ&lt;/a&gt;. “The body may react to them as useless or harmful, so its systems may become impaired or damaged, depending on their vulnerability and the amount of ultra-processed food consumed.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000z3b6na9kq87tw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The stakes are high: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-death-wellness"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that eating just 10% more calories a day from &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-cancer-wellness/index.html"&gt;ultraprocessed food&lt;/a&gt; — that’s about one serving — may be associated with a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-health-risks-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;50% higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of cardiovascular disease-related death. There is also a 55% greater chance of obesity and a 40% higher probability of developing type 2 diabetes. The risk of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-stroke-cognitive-decline-wellness/index.html"&gt;cognitive decline and stroke&lt;/a&gt; also rises, as does the chance of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-cancer-wellness/index.html"&gt;developing cancers&lt;/a&gt; of the upper digestive tract.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00103b6n7qad1tso@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the Consumer Brands Association, which represents major food manufacturers, told me in an email “there is currently no agreed upon scientific definition of ultra-processed foods.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00113b6nsomxpp2h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Attempting to classify foods as unhealthy simply because they are processed, or demonizing food by ignoring its full nutrient content, misleads consumers and exacerbates health disparities,” said Sarah Gallo, CBA’s senior vice president of product policy. “Americans deserve facts based on sound science in order to make the best choices for their health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00123b6n4nyo6y4r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, she said, food and beverage manufacturers have long invested in product labeling, “so that consumers can review product ingredients and nutrition information and make decisions best for them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00133b6njujkc39t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To manufacture cheap, delicious food that is packaged for convenience, experts say basic food crops such as potatoes, corn, wheat and soybeans may be disassembled into their molecular parts — starchy flours, protein isolates, fats and oils — to create what manufacturers call “slurries.” (How do they do it?  &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsKsrCGfxLY" target="_blank"&gt;Watch this video.&lt;/a&gt;)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00143b6nbub2x0tb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The cell&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;walls of the plants are destroyed, dispersing micronutrients that often need to work together to nurture our bodies. Insoluble &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/10/health/high-fiber-diet-weight-loss-mortality-study-intl"&gt;plant fiber&lt;/a&gt; we need to be healthy may also &lt;a href="https://www.cspi.org/article/high-fiber-foods-ultra-processed-pretenders-what-know" target="_blank"&gt;be lost&lt;/a&gt;. What’s left is a substance some scientists call “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/01/health/predigested-food-wellness"&gt;predigested&lt;/a&gt;” — not unlike the regurgitated food a mama bird feeds her babies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00153b6nzr7utecv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Barry Popkin, the W.R. Kenan Jr. Distinguished Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Gillings School of Global Public Health, has seen the process firsthand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00163b6nt3px83m2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the early 2000s, I went into some food plants and I saw the stuff — it was supposed to be granola bars, shredded wheat cereal,” Popkin said. “It was colorless, odorless. I scooped some up in a spoon and tried to taste it — it was like sawdust or something.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00173b6n4q1rdmkd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s why eating “predigested” food can be a problem: When we eat whole foods as our bodies are meant to do, we absorb micronutrients throughout the entire digestive process. If they are exploded into smithereens in an ultraprocessed food, do we still have access to them? If we do, are they absorbed by the body in the ways nature meant them to be?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00183b6n3tsoljqg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I’m not aware of any studies that answer that question, although research is underway. But according to some food scientists I’ve spoken to, it doesn’t matter — manufacturers just add back missing vitamins, fiber and protein during manufacturing and voilà! It’s as good as new.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00193b6nleu4wng0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Or is it? Is a patched-up Humpty Dumpty really the same Dumpty that fell off the wall?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001a3b6nyn1c2bhr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Let’s get back to the slurries: Next, with the help of artificial colorings, flavorings, texturizers and glue-like emulsifiers, ingredients are mixed, heated, pounded, shaped or extruded into any food a manufacturer can dream up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001b3b6njp8au3qt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s an illusion of food,” Dr. Chris van Tulleken told me &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/01/health/predigested-food-wellness"&gt;last year.&lt;/a&gt;  He is a BBC contributor and professor of infection and global health at University College London.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001c3b6n7n0sshmb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really expensive and difficult for a food company to make food that is real and whole, and much cheaper for food companies to destroy real foods, turn them into molecules, and then reassemble those to make anything they want,” said van Tulleken, author of the 2023 book “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Processed-People-Cant-Stop-Eating/dp/1324076267" target="_blank"&gt;Ultra-Processed People&lt;/a&gt;: Why Do We All Eat Stuff That Isn’t Food … and Why Can’t We Stop?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001d3b6nbb42n16l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I’m still wandering around the snack aisle, so let’s put our knowledge to the test by looking at one of my kids’ old favorites — ranch-flavored veggie straws. As a conscientious mom, I always reached for the organic version.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001e3b6ny3pe1vsh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of the more than 30 ingredients, three are additives: sodium caseinate, used as an emulsifier; calcium chloride, which extends shelf life; and potassium chloride, a flavor enhancer used to treat low blood pressure and low potassium levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001f3b6n28jra10y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All are designated GRAS (&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/03/health/food-supply-safety-loopholes-wellness"&gt;generally regarded as safe&lt;/a&gt;) for use in food by the US Food and Drug Administration. Yet by NOVA’s standards, those veggie straws are definitely ultraprocessed.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001g3b6njp87d70s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Let’s look at the nutrition label. The top ingredient is potato starch, followed by potato powder. Then come various oils, dehydrated vegetable powders (such as bell peppers, carrots, spinach), turmeric and beetroot powders (for color), and dried milk products (for the ranch taste). There are some vitamins and minerals. Oh, and salt and sugar, of course.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001h3b6n6rtu9zzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            None of that sounds dangerous, but all those powders? That’s a red flag that these kid-friendly straws may not have been made from my “Mom” vision of sautéed veggies pureed in a blender, poured into a mold and baked until puffy. Instead, it’s possible they were created from a potato-based sludge, colored and flavored with vegetable powders, and enriched with vitamins before being squeezed through a tube and baked.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001i3b6ni71kk8i7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s something scientists can’t determine. In fact, none of us can, because how these foods are made is proprietary to each manufacturer, which closely guards recipes and “bliss point” algorithms from competitors and the public.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001j3b6ngw2fnsb4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I tried to obtain access to a major food company’s production site on several occasions to understand how potato chips and other foods are made. Six months later, I gave up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001k3b6ns8ged0rc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Food companies today, they’ve closed off their processing plants,” Popkin said. “So we’ve never been able to have a clinical study studying what happens if you eat real corn versus deconstructed corn.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001l3b6n5n36zzj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But wait — I buy organic versions of the veggie straws, doesn’t that help? Unfortunately, no. Buying organic does reduce pesticide levels, but that’s not part of ultraprocessing. Turning even an organic vegetable into refined flakes and powders may destroy the plant’s food matrix — cell walls that hold nutrients — and like our Humpty Dumpty, that food must be put back together again.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001m3b6nbjbp60vq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many experts have tried to simplify the chore of avoiding ultraprocessing by advising consumers to choose foods with no more than five ingredients or avoid foods with ingredients you can’t pronounce or can’t find at home.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001n3b6n2tgqodqq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those are great suggestions if you have time to read labels. It’s also not a complete solution. Let’s look at my favorite potato chip, which only has three ingredients on the label: potatoes, salt and oil. Does that mean this potato chip is now good for me? Or is it still a junk food even though it isn’t ultraprocessed by the NOVA definition?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001o3b6nikvrvi5a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those convenient, kid-friendly frozen chicken nuggets are easy to identify as ultraprocessed. And here’s a startling fact: Nuggets typically contain &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8537092/" target="_blank"&gt;transglutaminase,&lt;/a&gt; which the industry calls “meat glue.” It’s an enzyme that helps combine parts of an animal or different animals into one product — hot dogs, sausages and deli meats are common examples. (Hint: If the food packaging reads “formed” or “reformed,” it likely contains transglutaminase.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001p3b6nzqngyr8e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Transglutaminase isn’t easy to pronounce, and it’s not an ingredient you’ll have at home. Yet the &lt;a href="https://ific.org/resources/articles/what-is-transglutaminase/" target="_blank"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/Is-Transglutaminase-Enzyme-TG-Enzyme-Safe#:~:text=Yes%2C%20Transglutaminase%20Enzyme%20(TG%20enzyme,products%20for%20over%2010%20years." target="_blank"&gt;US Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; have no problem with it because it dissipates when cooked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001q3b6nhntxbie0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This next challenge is harder: Are most breads on grocery store shelves ultraprocessed by NOVA standards? Unless it’s freshly baked from scratch, the answer is “most likely,” although experts disagree.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001r3b6njw5rlwzm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            From the NOVA perspective, if a bread lasts longer than a week or so without mold, it may have a synthetic preservative in it. Common additives in bread include calcium propionate, an artificial preservative linked to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12173999/" target="_blank"&gt;behavior problems in children&lt;/a&gt;;  &lt;a href="https://www.foodchemadditives.com/side_effects_info/781#:~:text=General%20Side%20Effects,review%20it%20and%20respond%20soon." target="_blank"&gt;potassium sorbate&lt;/a&gt;, another synthetic preservative linked to skin and respiratory issues in people who are sensitive to it; and BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) and BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene), two more artificial preservatives that &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2025/04/despite-health-harm-concerns-bha-and-bht-remain-food-and-cosmetics" target="_blank"&gt;may be linked&lt;/a&gt; to hormone and reproductive disruption and cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001s3b6nlpm4fhbv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But what if the bread is made with whole wheat or whole grains you can actually see and taste? It may still be ultraprocessed, but isn’t it better for you? That is still a fiercely debated question.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001t3b6n0sps4a7u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, here’s a tricky one: plant-based meat substitutes. Ultraprocessed to their core, many experts say these alt meats are still better for us than red and processed meats full of saturated fats or nitrates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001u3b6ntpuo6uzk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fat composition of beef is so undesirable for health that it’s very easy to be better than that,” leading nutrition researcher Dr. Walter Willett told me &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/21/health/plant-based-meat-benefits-wellness"&gt;earlier this year.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001v3b6naa4ks2q8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Animal products not only have too much saturated fat but lack polyunsaturated fat, fiber and many of the minerals and vitamins available in plants,” said Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001w3b6nnu98pqg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many of the alt-meat products have dramatically improved their nutritional profiles since they first hit the market. Recent studies &lt;a href="https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Guide_-Where-does-plant-based-meat-fit-in-the-UPF-conversation_19-May.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; by the Physicians Association for Nutrition, or PAN International, found plant-based meats were dramatically lower in saturated fat, a little lower in overall calories, equal in protein, dramatically higher in fiber (beef has no fiber), and a bit higher in salt and sugar than conventional meat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001x3b6n1vb8dx5n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s also the role of plant-based meat in saving the planet. According to the &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Good Food Institute&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/resource/environmental-impacts-of-alternative-proteins/" target="_blank"&gt;promotes alternative proteins&lt;/a&gt; and coauthored the report, replacing a beef burger with a plant-based patty can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 98%&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and land use by up to 97%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001y3b6ng9goqqba@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I could go on and on, but here’s the bottom line: Deciding what is “ultraprocessed and bad for your health” and “ultraprocessed, but OK to eat” is really complicated — especially for a society unwilling or unable to give up inexpensive, convenient food.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader_elevate vossi-subheader_elevate--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmj1llnjb00373b6nv990gvau@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="a-lot-of-huffing-and-puffing-going-on" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        A lot of huffing and puffing going on…
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001z3b6nqktiftvo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fortunately, the world is taking action. In mid-May, the World Health Organization put out a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/call-for-experts-to-develop-a-who-guideline-on-consumption-of-ultra-processed-foods" target="_blank"&gt;global clarion call&lt;/a&gt; for scientists to help define and create guidelines for ultraprocessed food consumption. Once the panel is chosen, the work is expected to take two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00203b6n34x02gt9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A week later, the Trump Administration released its first “Make America Healthy Again” report, calling for action on &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/22/politics/maha-rfk-report-medicines-processed-foods-pesticides#:~:text=The%20report%20states%20that%20children,Kennedy%20told%20reporters%20on%20Thursday"&gt;ultraprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt; they say are a danger to our children’s health&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;An August 15 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/15/health/maha-report-draft-pesticide-ultraprocessed-food"&gt;leaked version&lt;/a&gt; of the second report — which was supposed to announce specific policy actions — instead called for the government to “continue efforts to develop a U.S. government-wide definition.” The final report, &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/maha-commission-report-childhood-disease-strategy.html" target="_blank"&gt;released in September,&lt;/a&gt; provided no additional action.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00213b6nk5k303vo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unfortunately, the final MAHA report is all promises and has no teeth,” University of Carolina’s Popkin &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/10/health/maha-report-children-health-response-wellness"&gt;told me at the time&lt;/a&gt;. “In my opinion, it shows the food, agricultural, and pharmaceutical industries got to the White House and won the day.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00223b6nxphulf9y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrew Nixon, deputy assistant secretary for media relations at the US Department of Health and Human Services, told me in an&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;email the administration is confronting the UPF challenge, which is a “major driver of the nation’s chronic disease epidemic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00233b6n76o0g9we@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Replacing them with real, whole foods is one of the most effective ways to Make America Healthy Again,” Nixon said. “We remain committed to serving the American people, not special interests or outside critics, by delivering radical transparency and upholding gold-standard science.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00243b6njra0ps5f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other groups have stepped into the void. The American Heart Association, for example, divided ultraprocessed food into &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001365" target="_blank"&gt;three categories&lt;/a&gt; — least healthy, moderately healthy and healthy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00253b6nkypfpr5w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Understandably, the AHA is most concerned with how foods impact the heart. High-fat red and processed meats fall within the “least healthy” category in the AHA report — as they should, considering their role in heart disease and colon cancer. However, red meat is also the &lt;em&gt;least &lt;/em&gt;processed food in that category.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00263b6nbxck5sk5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And yet, that’s the point: Regulating ultraprocessed foods by additives alone — without also addressing the health concerns of too much sugar, salt and saturated fat (hello, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/25/health/beef-tallow-healthy-seed-oils-rfk-wellness"&gt;beef tallow&lt;/a&gt;!) — won’t improve the nation’s food supply and our deteriorating health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00273b6nbt273vwu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an effort to fix that, Monteiro is campaigning for researchers and government officials to add more ingredients to the NOVA definition often used in creating food policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00283b6n9f4i7pxj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our proposal now is to target any food with an excess of sodium, saturated fat or sugar, along with synthetic colors, flavors and non-nutritive sweeteners,” Monteiro told me when I reported on a recent &lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/series-do/ultra-processed-food" target="_blank"&gt;three-part series&lt;/a&gt; in the journal The Lancet. He and Popkin coauthored the articles with 41 other internationally known scientists.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00293b6nieju32em@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, there is a missing element, according to Harvard’s Willett: “The huge blind spot of refined grains, which is the largest source of calories in the US and most countries at this time — this is not considered to be an UPF.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002a3b6non1c1zpt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Lancet series blasted the food industry, claiming global corporations continued to aggressively market and extensively profit from new and existing UPF products despite increasing evidence of harm to public health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002b3b6n5tey3pfn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The food industry doesn’t want to lose their cash cow, so they’re willing to put millions into fighting government restrictions on ultraprocessed food as well as funding nutritionists who’ll say there’s no evidence of harm,” Popkin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002c3b6noxi9dtdn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The International Food &amp;amp; Beverage Alliance, founded in 2008 by leading food and nonalcoholic beverage companies, told me in an email when the Lancet series published that health authorities worldwide have rejected the concept of ultraprocessed food due to its lack of scientific consensus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002d3b6nm2z8rndk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The policy and advocacy recommendations of this series go far beyond the available evidence — proposing new regulatory action based on ‘processing’ or additive ‘markers’ and calling for the exclusion of industry from policymaking,” said IFBA Secretary-General Rocco Renaldi.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002e3b6nmdm6mfmt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            California made history in early October by enacting the &lt;a href="https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB1264/id/3248161" target="_blank"&gt;first law in the United States&lt;/a&gt; to define and ultimately ban problematic ultraprocessed foods in public schools.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002f3b6nloi6vmlf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not only does the California legislation define ultraprocessed food — not an easy task as you have seen — it requires public health officials and scientists to decide which UPFs are most harmful to human health. An “ultraprocessed food of concern” would then be phased out of the school food supply. That’s impressive, considering California is projected to serve &lt;a href="https://a46.asmdc.org/press-releases/20250603-california-advances-first-nation-legislation-phase-out-harmful-ultra" target="_blank"&gt;over 1 billion meals&lt;/a&gt; to schoolchildren in the 2025–26 school year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002g3b6nkpnqn2tf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/09/health/california-governor-bans-red-dye-no-3-wellness/index.html"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; has also led the way in laws banning &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/26/health/food-dyes-maha-ultraprocessed-foods-wellness"&gt;food dyes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb/documents/fs/1559.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;potassium bromate&lt;/a&gt;, a possible carcinogen once widely used in breads, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/10/health/food-additives-dye-brominated-vegetable-oil-wellness/index.html"&gt;brominated vegetable oil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2004.83" target="_blank"&gt;propylparaben&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Here in California, we are actually doing the work to protect our kids’ health, and we’ve been doing it since well before anyone had ever heard of the MAHA movement,” said Jesse Gabriel, the Democratic California Assemblymember who introduced several of the bills, in an October 9 press conference.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002i3b6nhobwcthy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What’s so promising about the legislation is the scope of the effort. California lawmakers have considered many of the ways in which both junk and ultraprocessed foods may be harmful to human health — ingredients such as nonnutritive sweeteners; additives such as emulsifiers, stabilizers and thickeners; flavor enhancers; a host of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/17/health/red-40-food-dyes-wellness"&gt;food dyes&lt;/a&gt; and more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002j3b6noq80rasu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            American scientific research on the harms of UPF additives is in its infancy, but the new law has taken that into account. Additives banned, restricted or required to carry a warning by other local, state, federal or international jurisdictions will be in the analysis. That’s key, as the European Union and other countries have already regulated many additives still allowed in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Food modified to contain high amounts of saturated fat, sodium and added sugar can also be rejected, according to the law. This will help target industry strategies that may contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/health/child-addiction-ultraprocessed-foods-wellness"&gt;an addiction to ultraprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt; — an increasing concern for American children &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/health/ultraprocessed-food-ban-california-wellness"&gt;raised on UPFs&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002l3b6nvciqv3hs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The downside? The law won’t provide final details on which UPFs are most concerning until June 2028, and it won’t have all UPFs out of school lunches until 2035. I’m hopeful there will be useful updates as the process rolls along.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002m3b6ngkrhfqwx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While we wait for definitive action (don’t hold your breath), we still have to navigate the grocery store. Of course, the best way is to buy everything fresh and cook at home. But like you, I’m far too busy to do as much of that as I would like — plus my kids are grown and the pressure to set a good example is gone (although my new grandson may change that).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002n3b6ny3yjvcio@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, I stock up on frozen veggies — many are flash frozen and have the same nutrients as when first picked. Low-sodium canned beans and other legumes keep me from having to cook dry beans from scratch.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002o3b6nkqwrufzr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When I buy fresh produce, I try to buy organic if my budget allows. That’s especially true for crops in the 2025 “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/health/2025-dirty-dozen-pesticide-wellness"&gt;Dirty Dozen&lt;/a&gt;,” an annual list of foods with the most (and least) &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/24/health/pesticides-produce-fruits-vegetables-toxins-wellness"&gt;pesticides&lt;/a&gt; created by the Environmental Working Group, a health advocacy group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1yx38u00013b6px32naneu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I also do my best to avoid veggies and salad greens packaged in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/health/food-packaging-chemical-toxins-study-wellness" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;chemical-laden plastics&lt;/a&gt; (that’s a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/health/microplastics-food-packaging-study-wellness" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;whole other problem&lt;/a&gt; I write about). I especially stay away from precut veggies (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10969708/#:~:text=The%20B%20vitamins%20are%20highly,in%20small%20losses%20of%20iron." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;loss of nutrients&lt;/a&gt;) and foods sold in black plastic containers (&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/health/flame-retardant-black-plastic-wellness" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;read about those here&lt;/a&gt;.) That’s really hard because they are &lt;em&gt;everywhere!&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002p3b6nhq5m92np@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When it comes to ready-to-heat-and-eat meals, I look for whole chicken breasts, sliced beef and pork, chicken or steak kebabs, and stews with real chunks of meat. (Here’s a tip: If the package says the meat is cooked “sous vide,” I’ve found it’s more likely to be whole meat.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002q3b6n2rarfqbt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for the rest of the grocery store — the nearly 70% which is ultraprocessed — I do my best. I don’t know all the names of additives — much less which are harmful or beneficial — so that’s not very helpful to me. I could just as easily discard a food enriched with pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine (vitamin B6) or cobalamin (vitamin B12) as I could one with azodicarbonamide, a bleaching agent in bread &lt;a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:007:0045:0046:EN:PDF" target="_blank"&gt;banned in the EU&lt;/a&gt; due to cancer concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002r3b6n28d0ky1l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, I put on my detective hat, turn the product over, and read — starting with the nutrition label. Many people go straight to carbohydrates, but carbs are not necessarily the enemy — in whole foods they come naturally, along with fiber, vitamins and minerals. Foods which are overly processed, however, may need to increase levels of added sugars, salt and fat to make the food “&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31689013/" target="_blank"&gt;hyperpalatable&lt;/a&gt;” and hard to resist.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002s3b6njdl1dj2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A tablespoonful of ketchup, for example, can contain 4 grams (1 teaspoon) of added sugar, while spaghetti and pizza sauces are notoriously high in added sugar as well. If you search the shelves, however, there are low-salt, no sugar and no artificial sweetener options.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002t3b6n2b9ueek0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And this is important&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— the percentages on the nutrition label are only for &lt;em&gt;one &lt;/em&gt;serving. Let’s take honey peanut butter, part of a typical PB&amp;amp;J lunch for my kids while they were growing up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002u3b6nnxt2741m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The label says one serving — two tablespoons of peanut butter — has 13 grams of sugar (2.5 teaspoons). So if I put 3 servings on the sandwich — that’s an incredible &lt;em&gt;39 grams &lt;/em&gt;or&lt;em&gt; 7.3 teaspoons &lt;/em&gt;of sugar&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(not counting the jelly) in what many of us consider a healthy meal for a child.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002v3b6n42x3n26z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            (OK, you may know this, yes. But truthfully, how often do you stop and look at serving size? Yeah, me neither.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002w3b6nofpy0pxo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I then move to the ingredients listed in the order of prevalence. I look for signs of overprocessing (powdered veggies, of course). Additives are always at the bottom, but other culprits rise to the occasion. If sugar is first, second or third on the list, I tend to consider the food a dessert. If ingredients at the top are healthy and sugar is toward the bottom of the list, I’m not overly concerned.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002x3b6n173ijfkn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s a great example: An extremely popular organic bread in grocery stores has 35 ingredients — the first 21 are whole grains and seeds. The loaf has no synthetic additives, but it does have 4 grams of added sugar per serving in the form of organic molasses. Would you consider that a junk food? An ultraprocessed food overly laden with sugar? Or is it healthy? You decide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002y3b6nwkqz3hbz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet you shouldn’t have to decide, experts say. You should be able to go to your grocery store and buy foods that are good for you without having to play detective.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002z3b6nxx0hb3hn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The rise of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) in human diets is being driven by the growing economic and political power of the UPF industry,” wrote&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the authors of the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01567-3/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;third Lancet paper&lt;/a&gt;. “Curbing corporate power in food systems begins with governance reform.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00303b6nlc6kevoa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Otherwise, they added, UPFs may well “replace all other food groups” in the not-so-distant future.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00313b6nxgooe932@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yes, there will always be junk food, and yes, we will all succumb at times. But if the majority of our food was regulated to be as whole, fresh, and devoid of added sugar, salt, fat, additives and processing as possible, we would be a much healthier nation — and world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00323b6nywol4qay@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I’m not holding my breath.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Image credit: Anastasia Golovina/Stocksy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study found an association between people’s cheese consumption and a somewhat reduced risk of dementia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The observational study from researchers in Japan found that dementia risk appeared to be reduced by 1.06 percentage points.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most of the people in the study consumed processed cheese.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who regularly ate cheese were at a modestly lower risk of developing dementia in a new observational study from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reduction in risk was not large but was statistically significant, according to the researchers, thus underscoring the potential effect of diet on long-term cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Among the 7,914 people involved in the study, just 134 people who self-reported eating cheese developed symptoms of dementia after 3 years, compared to 176 people who said they were not regular cheese-eaters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who ate cheese were thus less likely to develop dementia by 1.06 percentage points. The authors of the study note that this reduction in risk is consistent with other research suggesting dairy products may have neuroprotective value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/21/3363" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, and it was funded by the &lt;a href="https://www.meiji.com/global/food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Meiji group&lt;/a&gt;, a Japanese company that sells, among other items, dairy products, including fermented and processed cheeses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is beyond the scope of an observational study to identify a direct causal relationship between, in this case, consumption of cheese and a reduced risk of developing dementia. The study simply reports an association between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect of cheese consumption on dementia risk may actually have something to do with how little cheese Japanese people eat, compared to people in the United States and other Western cultures, said first author &lt;a href="https://sciprofiles.com/profile/428968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Seungwon Jeong&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, from the Department of Community Welfare, Faculty of Health Sciences, at the Niimi University in Okayama, Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/cheese-consumption-by-country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;current estimates&lt;/a&gt;, the average amount of cheese consumed per person per year in the U.S. is of 17.4 kilograms (kg). It is the nation that eats the most cheese by far. Japan ranks 15th, with a per capita consumption of just 2.6 kg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Japan has a very low baseline level of cheese consumption, so a small difference in frequency may appear more pronounced statistically in this context,” said Jeong. “We did not assess dose–response relationships, and cheese consumption in Japan is substantially lower than in Western countries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Therefore, even relatively small increases in consumption might be associated with meaningful differences,” she said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous studies,” Jeong noted, “have also suggested that effect sizes may vary depending on the regional context and baseline intake levels. In countries where cheese consumption is already high, similar increments may not lead to statistically significant differences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the far higher rate of cheese consumption in the West, “this study is intriguing but should be taken with a big grain of salt,” cautioned &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, a registered dietician specializing in heart disease, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eating a small amount of cheese once a week [in the study] was linked to a slightly lower risk of dementia but this is observational over just 3 years, and can’t prove cheese is doing the work. The ‘benefit’ could easily come from other factors, like a generally healthier diet, lifestyle, or socioeconomic advantages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Still, if you enjoy a little cheese, this suggests it can fit into a brain healthy diet, but it shouldn’t make headlines that cheese alone will protect your brain,” she told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming large quantities of cheese — more likely to occur in the U.S. than Japan — has been the source of some concern, even for dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Jeong pointed out that, “according to general nutritional guidance, excessive intake of any food is not advisable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cheese has historically raised concerns because of its typical high sodium and high saturated fat content that can worsen blood pressure or lipid levels, both well-established dementia risk factors,” said Routhenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10509445/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;large cohort studies&lt;/a&gt; generally show that small amounts of cheese are not linked to cardiovascular harm or dementia risk, and some suggest potentially favorable outcomes for fermented dairy,” she admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although our study was epidemiological rather than mechanistic,” said Jeong, “previous literature suggests that cheese contains &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325059" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;vitamin K2&lt;/a&gt;, antioxidant components — such as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/287842" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;selenium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vitamin-e" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt; — protein, and amino acids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These, Routhenstein explained, “help keep blood vessels healthy, support calcium balance, and reduce inflammation, factors that may protect the brain and lower dementia risk.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more than 80% of the cheeses eaten by participants in the study were processed, Jeong added that less-processed, or fermented, cheeses, “generally contain more bioactive peptides or probiotics, so it is possible that a higher proportion of fermented cheese intake could show a stronger association with cognitive health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some epidemiological studies,” said Jeong, “have reported favorable associations between the consumption of fermented foods containing lactic acid bacteria and cognitive function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not all cheeses are created equal,” explained Routhenstein, “and how you eat them matters as much as the type.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fermented cheeses are more favorable, especially in a modest 1–to–2-ounce portion as part of a balanced diet with vegetables, legumes, or whole grains, rather than on a heavy, high-fat dish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Highly processed, high-sodium cheeses or preparations with refined carbs, heavy cream, or deep-frying are less ideal,” Routhenstein cautioned.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Large amounts of cheese in dishes like casseroles can increase saturated fat and sodium over recommended limits, reducing potential benefits,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In short,” Routhenstein concluded, “cheese can fit into a brain-healthy diet, but it is not just the cheese itself, it is the portion, preparation, and overall context of the meal that matter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 07:04:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTFBsaVFRZVJ3dWZPNnJrSFFWWkZ2anM4OGVxQ01yMXJjTTlFcTQ3bFpEbDloR0w2Qm5WUW53MXR5YjJKOUpVc3BkZ2FwZy1uc0JvV3dhWHZSVGlDejlNaU9TbHpTbjNkMllqd3VIaTZ0aTRXSk1ZWTBrY2tn</guid></item><item><title>如果您每天步行10,000步有困难，请尝试这种科学支持的步行锻炼-《独立报》</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/health-and-fitness/10000-steps-walking-workout-heart-health-b2880115.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gIQPHK sc-jbiisr-1 sc-1wfc891-0 fooWDH" id="main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="big-letter"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;alking is cheap, accessible and immensely good for you, improving all manner of metrics from heart health and blood pressure to aerobic fitness and mood. For these reasons and more, it should form the foundation of your weekly movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This insight has given rise to the goal of walking &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/10k-steps-a-day-walking-b2735565.html"&gt;10,000 steps a day&lt;/a&gt; – a figure recent &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ugr.es/en/about/news/how-many-steps-take-each-day-reduce-risk-premature-death8000"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; claims has “no scientific basis”, but one that promotes 90-odd minutes on your feet each day, which will still deliver plenty of health perks for most people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The common rebuttal to this popular prescription is a lack of time; the idea of carving out 90 minutes of walking time in a busy day can seem insurmountable to many, even when this is split into smaller chunks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those in this camp, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/emmanuel-stamatakis.html"&gt;Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of physical activity, lifestyle and population health at the University of Sydney, suggests an alternative approach based on his recent research around walking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan below is designed as a starting point for sedentary people who struggle to find time to exercise. It uses the latest science to secure optimal bang for your buck from your steps, providing a pathway to more movement and better health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The time-efficient walking plan for better health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each day, complete: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-1k7glnk-1 dDVXDN irZnNR"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One or two walks at a comfortable but steady pace, lasting 10 to 15 minutes or more. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;During these walks, include two to four 30 to 60-second fast-paced bursts. These bursts could also involve climbing stairs or walking uphill to increase the intensity. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-healthy-habits-every-day-b2837119.html"&gt;Do these five things daily for 90 days to see a ‘profound difference’ in your health, fitness and energy levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/27/10/19/According-to-experts-theres-more-to-consider-than-just-the-number-of-steps-youre-taking.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/27/10/19/According-to-experts-theres-more-to-consider-than-just-the-number-of-steps-youre-taking.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/27/10/19/According-to-experts-theres-more-to-consider-than-just-the-number-of-steps-youre-taking.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Walking requires no specialist equipment, but can offer many health benefits, particularly for those who currently have low activity levels" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-203181"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Walking requires no specialist equipment, but can offer many health benefits, particularly for those who currently have low activity levels&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The science behind this plan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people who will prosper most from exercise are not the sporting elite, but rather those who currently move very little – the transition from zero exercise to some exercise is where the greatest spike in benefits can be seen. This is the population Professor Stamatakis chooses to focus on in much of his research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our primary audience is people who are less active – often older adults or individuals who struggle to accumulate large daily step volumes,” he says. “These are the people who tend not to reach conventional targets such as 150 minutes of weekly exercise or 7,000 to 8,000 steps per day. For millions in this group, structured exercise can feel unrealistic or unappealing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues set out to find small but achievable adjustments people could make in their daily behaviours to access “meaningful health benefits”. This year, they uncovered a couple of options: aiming for longer walks rather than shorter ones, and increasing the intensity of your walks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those taking 8,000 steps a day or less, longer walks lasting 10 minutes or more were found to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease by two-thirds compared to those who accrued their daily steps through shorter walks, according to a 2025 &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41144973/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Sydney and Universidad Europea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main takeaway is a very empowering one: there are options other than dramatically increasing the amount of physical activity you do to improve health,” Professor Stamatakis says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study suggests that even one or two comfortable, steady 10 to 15-minute walks a day may meaningfully reduce cardiovascular risk. For many older or less active adults, this is a far more achievable goal than trying to accumulate thousands more steps or beginning structured exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not saying short walks don’t count; they absolutely do. But if someone’s daily movement is mostly made up of, for example, two- to three-minute bouts of light- to moderate-intensity walking, shifting even a portion of that into slightly longer stretches may produce measurable health gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A brisk, continuous walk to the shops, around the block or during a phone call can be a great start. The idea is adjusting patterns, not striving for perfection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/strength-training-for-longevity-b2826608.html"&gt;The science-backed exercise method that can help fight the effects of ageing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bHmhpR"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/04/14/16/iStock-2068501719.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/04/14/16/iStock-2068501719.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/04/14/16/iStock-2068501719.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Increasing the intensity of your walk by climbing a hill or raising the pace can increase the health and fitness perks on offer" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-203182"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Increasing the intensity of your walk by climbing a hill or raising the pace can increase the health and fitness perks on offer&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second 2025 &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39467622/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Professor Stamatakis and his colleagues discovered the merits of vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity - or VILPA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vigorous-intensity activity is that which leaves you out of breath, to the point you can’t speak in full sentences; lifestyle activity is movement you do organically as part of your daily routine. Combine the two and you have acts such as climbing the stairs, carrying heavy shopping or even vigorous housework. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research found that, in non-exercisers, “between five to 10 episodes of vigorous-intensity activity, lasting up to one minute, done on a daily basis, seems to be associated with between 30 and 50 per cent lower risk of cardiovascular conditions, cancer and mortality”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A sustainable daily plan of physical activity for people who do not do many steps might include one or two longer bouts of walking at a comfortable but steady pace, each incorporating three to four short ‘VILPA’ bursts of very fast walking lasting 30 to 60 seconds each,” Professor Stamatakis says. “If the opportunity arises, these short bursts may also involve stair climbing or uphill walking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using this scenario, the person could accumulate 15 to 30 minutes of walking per day in the pattern most likely to be beneficial. This includes three to eight minutes of &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/exercise-more-effective-walking-heart-health-b2878666.html"&gt;vigorous-intensity activity&lt;/a&gt;, which, we know, can work miracles for heart health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see long-term benefits, the caveat to this plan is consistency. This practice must be followed on three to four days per week to begin with, and built up to a daily habit over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/nutrionist-healthy-longevity-diet-b2862364.html"&gt;What foods nutrition experts really eat to stop chronic illness in old age (and always avoid)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 kjtpPj"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/08/11/14/A-new-scientific-review-suggests-walking-can-offer-many-impressive-benefits-beyond-simply-reducing-a.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/08/11/14/A-new-scientific-review-suggests-walking-can-offer-many-impressive-benefits-beyond-simply-reducing-a.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/08/11/14/A-new-scientific-review-suggests-walking-can-offer-many-impressive-benefits-beyond-simply-reducing-a.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Longer walks lasting 10 minutes or more have been linked to increased positive impacts on heart health than shorter strolls" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-203183"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Longer walks lasting 10 minutes or more have been linked to increased positive impacts on heart health than shorter strolls&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The purpose of this plan &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end goal here should still be to increase your overall activity levels in line with &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/behealthy/physical-activity"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/physical-activity-guidelines-for-adults-aged-19-to-64/"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; physical activity guidelines for adults aged 19-64. “Do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week, or do at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or do an equivalent combination of both”. Introducing formal exercise will usually be the most direct route to improved health and fitness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this plan is designed for non-exercisers who are not currently physically active – those who take less than 8,000 steps per day, by Professor Stamatakis’ definition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a professional athlete or avid exerciser added two 15-minute walks into their days, the impact on their heart health would likely be negligible as they already have a strong foundation of fitness. But for those who struggle to squeeze regular movement into their routine, it represents a significant step in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of Professor Stamatakis’s research is to expand the options available to “the 80 to 85 per cent of the population, usually middle-aged and older adults, who are not keen on regular structured exercise”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not about an optimal fitness solution,” his colleague and co-author Dr Matthew Ahmadi adds. “If you want to become fully fit, of course, structured exercise is the way to go, but it comes with major commitments. You need to have the time, motivation and skills to know how to do it; sometimes you need to spend money on gym memberships and gear, and even travel to another place because not everyone lives near a park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a long list of reasons why most people don’t exercise regularly, or at all. This is the target population that our research is addressed to, and these are the people we want to help because they are at the highest risk of chronic disease and compromised lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/negative-health-effects-of-sitting-down-b2842653.html"&gt;From back pain to heart health – Experts reveal how to counter the negative effects of too much sitting down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPeW9MX3o5TTZyUTE3MnNyM1diUzkxWFVxdG12X3dOOTlqZDVtM1FYbE1ISFo2bnZ5Rkg1a1MxX3hVakdQa2VMQUIxNC1OWGdrM2M3cnpGNUZqT190bWlQVUtkR3AzT09ZUDUzOW55RFdLdGQ2Z0VXeWxpVVpaVXVfdUREb3JWdjdUTUlydEpfQm0yMGhDLUR5NU1XZThDcG54aEtKLTNR</guid></item><item><title>一位瑜伽老师说，这是她用来改善老年人姿势和平衡的简单三步站立顺序- Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://www.fitandwell.com/wellness/yoga/a-yoga-teacher-says-this-is-the-simple-three-move-standing-sequence-she-uses-to-improve-posture-and-balance-in-older-adults</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

I’ve seen clients in their 90s regain steadiness and confidence simply through consistent standing-only sequences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing practices remove barriers, creating independence, confidence, and accessibility without needing props or a mat, which makes them more accessible to those who may not have much space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re short on time, Ory recommends integrating these movements into your day. You could practice while brushing your teeth, waiting in line or preparing meals if you don’t want to set aside a specific time for yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5oPaTGRhP5DVjUwXWEf6L" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5oPaTGRhP5DVjUwXWEf6L slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the three standing poses and how to do them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-mountain-pose" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-mountain-pose"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

Roll your shoulders back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your chin level with the ground—ease your head gently back to counter a forward-leaning neck if this is an issue for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Invite the breath to flow without force, creating stability without rigidity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="443ecfad-644f-4675-8501-656de248fe0b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;: “This grounded alignment helps improve posture, proprioception and balance, especially for older adults or anyone experiencing vertigo, knee sensitivity or general instability,” says Ory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-tree-pose" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-tree-pose"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

You can also slide your foot up to your calf or inner thigh if this is in your range. You can use a wall for support if needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grow your branches by extending your arms over your head. Let them move with the gentle feel of a breeze. Alternatively, you can extend the opposite arm to your raised leg and sweep it over your head for an added side stretch (pictured).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you wobble or fall, practice returning with softness and humor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="c8dbf6a9-944d-4f8e-9a9c-b5515bde78d1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;: “Tree pose develops single-leg strength, ankle stability, inner-thigh activation and deep focus,” says Ory. “It’s supportive for clients recovering from surgery or regaining balance and confidence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-chair-pose" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-chair-pose"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

You should feel your quads and glutes engage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your chest lifted and spine straight, bringing your palms together in front of your chest. You can also hold hands behind your back or use a strap for a heart-opening shoulder stretch here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure to breathe steadily and keep your eyes focused

It feels harmless, even normal. But according to health experts, the amount of alcohol that many people consider routine actually puts them into the category of a heavy drinker without realising it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t about addiction, it’s about understanding how much alcohol our bodies can handle before health risks increase significantly. Experts now say the surprising truth: regularly consuming what feels like a modest amount, the equivalent of about two drinks every day, can already push someone beyond safe limits and into higher-risk territory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Alcohol Consumption Linked to Increased Cancer Risk, Classified as Carcinogen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t realise they’ve crossed that line because social customs and habits make those drinks seem “normal.”middle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your 'Normal' is a medical diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides an unequivocal definition for excessive consumption. Based on weekly volume, Heavy Drinking is categorized as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For Women: Consuming 8 or more standard drinks per week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For Men: Consuming 15 or more standard drinks per week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This definition directly contradicts what many adults consider a relaxed or moderate habit. Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Sarah Wakeman brought this discrepancy into sharp focus when discussing these thresholds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drinking two glasses of wine a day consistently… that would put me in the heavy drinking category. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would surprise most people, right? For many people that's very normal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This quote is the crux of the problem: a routine considered socially normal, a few drinks over dinner several times a week—is medically classified as high-risk consumption, subjecting the body to accelerated, chronic damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Calculating your standard drink&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deception thrives because we confuse a "serving" with a "standard drink." The medical world defines a standard drink as containing 14 grams of pure alcohol. This standardization exposes the hidden volume in your glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the typical Indian consumer, this means:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hard Liquor (Whiskey/Vodka): A 30ml peg (the standard measure) is one standard drink. If you're pouring 60ml pegs, you’re instantly consuming two standard drinks per glass.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wine: That generous pour in your large wine glass (often 200ml) is not one drink, it's nearly two standard drinks and often pushes women straight to the weekly limit in a single evening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By simply multiplying the number of drinks by the actual alcohol content, you will find your weekend intake often skyrockets well past the 8/15 line, making your body work overtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cancer, liver failure, and brain damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crossing the 8/15 weekly threshold accelerates the trajectory toward severe, chronic disease. The health consequences are systemic and often irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cancer Risk is Non-Zero: The global consensus is that no safe drinking level exists when it comes to cancer. Alcohol is a proven carcinogen linked to increased risk for at least seven types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, mouth, throat, and liver cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Organ Failure: Chronic heavy consumption overwhelms the liver, leading to fatty liver disease, inflammation (hepatitis), and ultimately irreversible cirrhosis (scarring) and organ failure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brain and Mental Health: Heavy use is linked to cognitive impairment, accelerated risk of dementia, and is strongly associated with the worsening of mental health conditions like depression and anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence clearly indicates that a change in behavioral patterns is now necessary. If your weekly alcohol consumption regularly remains at or exceeds 8 standard drinks for women and 15 for men, you are effectively accepting an alarming and avoidable increase in serious health risks. To truly prioritize your health and well-being, it is essential to acknowledge these medical guidelines and make the necessary adjustments to your social drinking habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

But winter is also a surprisingly active time for allergy symptoms in the Beehive State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though many people associate allergies with spring, you can absolutely have allergies in the winter, and Utah's unique climate makes them especially persistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry air, months spent indoors and winter inversion all contribute to a spike in runny noses, itchy eyes and coughing, even when nothing outside appears to be blooming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what to know about winter allergies in Utah, how to tell them apart from a cold or flu and what you can do to find relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes winter allergies?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter allergies in Utah come from a mix of indoor and outdoor triggers. Some are present year-round, but they become noticeable when cold weather pushes everyone inside and air quality takes a dip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Indoor allergens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indoor allergens are most often the &lt;a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/news/yes-you-can-have-allergies-winter#:~:text=Winter%20is%20cold%20and%20virus,can%20trap%20dust%20and%20allergens." rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;cause of winter allergies&lt;/a&gt;. When doors and windows stay shut for months, indoor particles circulate constantly through your home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common triggers include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dust mites&lt;/strong&gt;: These thrive in warm indoor environments and can irritate sinuses throughout winter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pet dander&lt;/strong&gt;: Dogs and cats spend more time indoors during cold months, shedding more allergens into the air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mold&lt;/strong&gt;: Bathrooms, basements and humid areas can harbor mold spores that worsen symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indoor pollution&lt;/strong&gt;: Wood-burning stoves, fireplaces and candles add irritants to the air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Utah winters are extra dry, static and dust buildup are even more common, creating an environment where allergy symptoms can flare easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Outdoor allergens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outdoor allergens don't disappear in winter. Some trees, including juniper, cedar and elm, begin releasing pollen as early as late February. Sensitive residents can feel symptoms weeks before spring officially arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Track the daily pollen levels through &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/weather/pollenCount" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;KSL's pollen count page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Inversion and air quality&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah's winter inversion also plays a significant role. When cold air becomes trapped under warm air, pollutants build up close to the ground. These pollutants aren't allergens, but they irritate the respiratory system and make allergy symptoms feel more intense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor air quality can trigger:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congestion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coughing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Throat irritation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watery or itchy eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breathing discomfort, especially for people with asthma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indoor air quality can deteriorate when heating systems operate continuously. There are some &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/50880894/5-ways-to-improve-your-utah-homes-winter-air-quality?" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;easy steps you can take to improve your home's air&lt;/a&gt;, including replacing your air filter and testing for radon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is it winter allergies, a cold or the flu?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold and flu season arrives just as winter allergies ramp up, which makes it tricky to know what's causing your symptoms. But there are some &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/34133189/do-you-have-a-cold-hellip-or-is-it-seasonal-allergies" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;consistent differences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to tell them apart&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration&lt;/strong&gt;: Colds and the flu usually clear up within three to 10 days. Allergies tend to linger for weeks or months. If your symptoms last longer than 10 days, allergies are more likely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: Allergies don't cause fever. The flu often does.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body aches&lt;/strong&gt;: Viral illnesses commonly cause body aches; allergies don't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mucus color&lt;/strong&gt;: Allergies usually produce clear mucus. Yellow or green mucus tends to &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-nasal-mucus-color-what-does-it-mean/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;indicate a viral or bacterial infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Itching&lt;/strong&gt;: Itchy eyes, nose or throat are classic allergy symptoms, not cold or flu symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If symptoms include a high fever, sudden worsening, shortness of breath or anything that interferes with normal breathing, it's important to seek medical care. Allergists can pinpoint specific triggers and recommend long-term options like &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/46301789/allergy-shots-helps-utah-father-battle-spring-allergy-season" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How long do winter allergies last?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter allergies in Utah can last from late fall through early spring. Indoor heating, inversion cycles and early tree pollen mean symptoms often persist from November into March or even April. Your personal triggers and exposure levels will determine how long your symptoms stick around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention and relief tips&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While allergies can't be cured, there are several steps you can take to reduce symptoms and improve daily comfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Improve indoor air quality&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since indoor allergens are one of the biggest winter triggers, start by reducing the particles circulating in your home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Change HVAC filters regularly. High-efficiency filters capture dust, mold and dander.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vacuum and dust often. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter for best results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash bedding weekly. Hot water kills dust mites and removes buildup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Control humidity. Keep indoor humidity between &lt;a href="https://www.aaaai.org/tools-for-the-public/conditions-library/allergies/humidifiers-and-indoor-allergies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;40% and 50&lt;/a&gt;%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use an air purifier. HEPA purifiers help clean bedrooms and high-traffic areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reduce exposure to specific allergens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dust mites&lt;/strong&gt;: Use allergen-proof pillow and mattress covers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pet dander&lt;/strong&gt;: Keep pets out of bedrooms and groom them more often.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mold&lt;/strong&gt;: Clean damp spaces regularly and address leaks promptly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Medication options&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find relief from winter allergies in Utah with common over-the-counter treatments, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antihistamines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasal corticosteroid sprays&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saline rinses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Short-term decongestants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When to seek professional help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your symptoms last more than a few weeks or don't improve with over-the-counter treatments, it may be time to see an allergist. Persistent congestion, recurring sinus infections, wheezing or difficulty breathing can all signal that you need additional support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An allergist can help identify your specific triggers and create a treatment plan. This could include prescription options or long-term therapies like immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

With claims they aid digestion and bathroom regularity, improve skin health and promote a flat stomach, millions of Americans are spending hundreds on them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Probiotics are live microorganisms, typically bacteria or yeasts, designed to supplement the natural community of beneficial &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15302429/medications-gut-microbiome-health-bacteria-antibiotics-colorectal-cancer.html"&gt;microbes in the human gut&lt;/a&gt;.  They are intended to function as supportive reinforcements, helping to restore a healthy balance within the digestive system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their widespread popularity stems partly from a confluence of social media-driven factors, primarily the growing public understanding of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12448183/Theres-no-real-proof-probiotics-pills-yoghurt-drinks-ease-irritable-bowel-syndrome-says-study.html"&gt;the gut's critical role&lt;/a&gt; in overall health and the meteoric rise in the number of wellness gurus gaining traction on &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-4ae5aee0-d799-11f0-aafc-8308d89a827d"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As research continues to illuminate, there are connections between gut microbiota and everything from mood to metabolism. So, consumers have proactively sought ways to improve their internal ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a growing contingent of doctors and researchers now advise the roughly 4 million Americans taking probiotics to manage their expectations, as many popular products, which can cost anywhere from $20 to more than $60 for a month's supply, are over-hyped and may not be effective for their intended use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts told the Daily Mail that, in many cases, the efficacy of probiotics depends on the strains the capsules contain. The wrong strain will not produce the benefits people expect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nicolette Pace, a registered dietitian nutritionist based in New York, told the Daily Mail: ‘Probiotics are promising, but the hype has far outpaced the science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Supplements often contain strains chosen without strong data, and researchers still have not identified which strains reliably help specific conditions.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to microbiologists, healthy people who eat well do not need a daily probiotic, an expense they consider unnecessary (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dan Jackowiak a nutritional consultant and holistic healthcare practitioner, told the Daily Mail: ‘Most of the time, when people take a random probiotic for bloating, gas, or IBS, good studies do not show a clear, consistent benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Some studies show a little help, some show none, and the results don't line up well. That's why major gut health guidelines say there isn't strong enough proof to recommend probiotics for most everyday digestive problems.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The global probiotic supplement market, projected to surpass $65 billion this year, is fueled by claims that these products can address a vast spectrum of ailments, from digestive issues to mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Gastroenterological Association released a landmark verdict on probiotics in 2020, finding insufficient evidence to recommend them for most common gut conditions like IBS, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The group only endorsed specific probiotic formulations for three narrow uses, including preventing C. difficile, a type of bacterium that causes severe inflammation of the colon, in patients on antibiotics, preventing a serious condition in preterm infants and managing a complication of inflammatory bowel disease called pouchitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pace told the Daily Mail: ‘Researchers haven’t yet matched specific strains to specific conditions, which means many supplements are created based on manufacturer preference rather than evidence. Some formulas are grounded in science, but many are not.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that if someone chooses to use a supplement anyway, the most practical option is to select one containing many strains in hopes of better coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Popular probiotic supplements include the capsules pictured above&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Just understand that a general “take a probiotic pill for overall health” approach is not strongly supported by clinical data,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people, however, report anecdotal evidence of their benefits and doctors tend to say they can continue taking them, as there is minimal downside or risk of severe health effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jackowiak said: ‘The reason people feel like probiotics changed their lives is mostly that some people really do match with a strain that helps their specific gut situation. If you're healthy and want better gut health, I would not start with probiotic pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The most reliable way to support your gut is still food, especially eating more kinds of plants and more fiber. That has more substantial evidence than taking a general probiotic.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since probiotics are sold as dietary supplements, the FDA does not test them for safety or effectiveness before they reach stores. This puts the responsibility on buyers to research whether a product's claims are backed by real evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A research team from Georgetown University Medical Center examined 93 probiotic products bought from national retailers and found a significant gap between marketing and evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only 35 percent of the products could be linked to published clinical studies that proved their specific strains were beneficial at the doses provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority of products, 65 percent, might have been effective, but researchers could not verify this because the labels lacked the precise scientific information; namely, the exact strain designation and its dose, needed to check against medical databases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dietitian Nicolette Pace notes that the science on probiotics lags far behind the hype. Supplements often use strains without strong evidence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Contrary to common marketing tactics, the study found that more expensive products with multiple strains and higher doses were not more likely to be backed by evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that simpler, less expensive products were more beneficial. The researchers concluded that the burden of proof falls on consumers, as companies rarely list clinical studies on their labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2018 study found that the probiotics' ability to influence human health is far more individualized and limited than commonly believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers discovered that while probiotic bacteria pass through the digestive tract and are detectable in stool, they are largely prevented from colonizing the gut lining by a person-specific defense mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This resistance is driven by an individual's unique native gut microbiome, which acts as a barrier that determines whether probiotic strains can take hold and exert any meaningful effect, suggesting that the current ‘one-size-fits-all’ model for probiotic supplements is ineffective for a significant portion of the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 20:15:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNWUtERkVWRjhXcEVDVGtzVFYxN1ktNmY3UnpDSEtQYy1Vc09GTlgxbkZmdnNoMWdjMEpGaUZtSWhHZUFhZ1pvMVVUeFoycHpVdzJIQUtCZk9lVE5Kb0d3bUxUdHdUX2hZd19jaWs2SWpCaHdFelY0djMxanB5Q3dGQ1ZRSWdvdlM5ako2U3N0UEtxcGxLNG0tRHZfWGsxX2w0VExYWlA4Y9IBrAFBVV95cUxPSTlxOGlxQWtLTHNKU2dWTXJKakcwajlicmFaWllBTHhtdFNMVU0wMHhLV0VOTFdveXNYVU1NWExqdmZaUGF5M191cmpveEpncFFFcXJWVHJTTHpoaXRuQnNpelo3a0hLUHdJNUoxa3N4SDdmekhzdVZHZGYxUS0ydUs1LUxscWNPZTdyZ0lNMU5hNmhCT0MtSDAwTWVLYVpLUHBDOHJETE0wOUt2</guid></item><item><title>心脏病是45岁以下突然死亡的主要原因：研究-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heart-disease-leading-cause-of-sudden-deaths-under-45-study/articleshow/125954017.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI: Sudden deaths are no longer confined to old age. An AIIMS study has found that more than half of all sudden deaths examined over a year occurred in people under 45 — many of them apparently healthy, who collapsed without warning at home or while travelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published this month in Indian Journal of Medical Research as part of an ongoing Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) project, the cross-sectional study was conducted between May 2023 and April 2024 at the departments of pathology and forensic medicine at AIIMS New Delhi. Of the 2,214 autopsies analysed, 180 cases — 8.1% — met the criteria for sudden death. Young adults aged 18–45 accounted for 103 of these cases, or 57.2%, with an average age of 33.6 years and a strong male predominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Keep your heart young post-30s with these 4 simple ways&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease emerged as the leading cause. Dr Sudhir Gupta, from AIIMS’s department of forensic medicine and an author of the study, said cardiovascular conditions accounted for 42.6% of sudden deaths in the young. Most had advanced coronary artery disease with severe blockages, often without any prior diagnosis, indicating that fatal heart disease had progressed silently. Respiratory causes — such as pneumonia, tuberculosis and asphyxia — accounted for a little over one in five deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than one-fifth of deaths in young adults remained unexplained despite detailed imaging, full autopsy and microscopic examination. These “negative autopsy” cases point to hidden electrical or genetic heart disorders that routine investigations may miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most deaths occurred at home or during travel, frequently at night or early morning. Sudden loss of consciousness was the most common symptom reported by families, followed by chest pain and breathlessness. Only a small number of young adults had known conditions such as diabetes or hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Over half of those who died young were smokers or consumed alcohol — rates similar to those for older adults. The study found no significant link between sudden deaths and Covid infection or vaccination — vaccination coverage was high across age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among adults aged 46–65, coronary artery disease was even more predominant, accounting for over 70% of sudden deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the findings, Dr K K Talwar, chairman, PSRI Heart Institute, said the study highlights a disturbing rise in premature coronary artery disease. He noted that many unexplained deaths occur likely due to inherited electrical disorders of the heart, which routine autopsies cannot detect, underscoring the need for genetic testing and family screening. He stressed early preventive check-ups, strict avoidance of tobacco and alcohol, and routine heart evaluations in younger people, while reiterating there is no evidence linking Covid vaccination to sudden cardiac deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers warn that sudden death in the young often stems from underlying disease, making early detection critical.

For men, hair loss can be genetic but can be&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; triggered by weight loss or even a fever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If hair loss is accompanied by fatigue, brain fog and weight gain, you may be suffering from an underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism, which slows the metabolism down, according to Professor Kristien Boelaert, a professor of endocrinology at the University of Birmingham. A blood test can determine if the issue is thyroid-related. “Once thyroid levels come back into balance, hair loss will recover but this can take several months,” Boelaert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/beauty/article/weight-loss-jabs-hair-loss-cause-8376fbg8f" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why some people on weight-loss jabs are losing their hair&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4dc1d114-de65-478a-b32b-c10c97322eae" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Greasy hair&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Genetics and overproduction of sebum in the scalp’s sebaceous glands are the primary causes of greasy hair, which can be exacerbated by hot weather and exercise. “Washing hair daily using a mild shampoo, such as Simple, will usually control symptoms,” Stevens says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Look at food intake too. “A diet high in ultraprocessed foods — specifically saturated fats and refined carbohydrates — may increase oil production in the scalp by affecting hormonal balance and sebum regulation,” says Rhiannon Lambert, a nutritionist and author of The Unprocessed Plate. “Reducing your intake of these foods and focusing on a diet rich in vegetables, wholegrains, lean proteins and healthy fats can support both scalp and overall health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/beauty/article/sun-damaged-hair-10-products-that-really-work-56pxj7gj3" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sun-damaged hair? 10 products that really work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="01393e47-e68a-424a-9f89-8439e5707996" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Colour loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The development of white or grey hair signals diminishing melanin production, a normal part of ageing. But a rapid colour loss could indicate a vitamin B12 deficiency. A blood test can determine if the problem is vitamin-related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Key sources of B12 include eggs, dairy, fish and meat — vegans may struggle. “Try a supplement of foods fortified in B12, such as plant milks or breakfast cereals,” Lambert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="11efb7b0-ecb3-43c1-b53b-4edc7b66c7b8" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Brittle hair&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Hairdryers and tongs can distress the hair shafts, but brittle hair can also be a sign of iron deficiency. This can change the texture of your hair and make it fragile, as iron is vital for red blood cells, specifically the haemoglobin within them, which carries oxygen to hair cells. Aim to eat iron-rich food at each meal, such as red meat, dark green leafy vegetables, legumes, eggs, tofu, nuts and dried apricots, raisins or figs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/article/the-secret-to-healthy-hair-try-a-japanese-head-spa-jm5jkmzq8" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The secret to healthy hair?

See a doctor if you’re concerned. Generally, if you have sensitive skin or eczema, avoid shampoos containing sodium lauryl sulfate, which clean well and lather nicely but can disrupt the skin barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If you develop a rash, a trichologist may remove any crusting and apply a steroid cream and recommend a tar-based shampoo — which slows down bacterial growth and reduces skin flaking. You might also need to change how you rinse you hair: “Sometimes people get an itchy scalp because of leaving product on,” says Dr Emma Craythorne, a consultant dermatologist based in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2e48324d-446d-4fac-bc9e-563d1b157187" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Extreme dandruff&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The scalp continually sheds its top layer, but if you get crusty flakes bigger than half a centimetre seek advice: you may be overproducing candida, a type of yeast. This may be caused by stress or a poor diet, both of which can weaken the immune system, making it harder for your body to control the growth of candida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Dandruff can be managed with shampoos containing ketoconazole, zinc pyrithione, or coal tar,” Stevens says.

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to mix and match meals if there’s one you don’t like. The Mediterranean diet is a flexible way of eating that emphasizes a wide array of fruits, vegetables, legumes, healthy fats and whole grains. You can repeat a meal in this plan or browse some of our other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18314/cuisines-regions/mediterranean/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet recipes&lt;/a&gt; for additional inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can eat the same breakfast or lunch every day if it’s easier for your routine. Each breakfast and lunch are high-protein, fairly similar in calories and follow the principles of the Mediterranean diet. If you’re closely monitoring calories or other nutrients, you may want to adjust a snack or two. Otherwise, a simple swap should work for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) recommends 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, though protein needs can vary.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, people who are pregnant, older adults and athletes typically have higher protein requirements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you have questions about your individual protein needs, consider reaching out to a registered dietitian for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_183-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean is a plant-forward way of eating that emphasizes a high intake of healthy fats, like fish, nuts, olive oil and avocado. This eating pattern has been linked to a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cognitive decline, certain cancers and obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Though it’s coined after the Mediterranean region in which it was first studied, the Mediterranean diet is a flexible way of eating that’s adaptable to a wide variety of cuisines and cultures. If you’re interested in following the Mediterranean diet, aim to cook more meals at home and include a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For proteins, the Mediterranean diet emphasizes fish, eggs, poultry, dairy and legumes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It typically limits red meat and particularly processed meats as well as refined grains and excess added sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

If you're recovering from sickness or injury, the nutrient will help your body heal. Protein is also needed to build muscle, especially if you exercise regularly. Also, high-protein breads can help you meet your protein needs if you have difficulty getting the nutrient from other sources. Fortunately, high-protein bread can be enjoyed just as you would any bread—in &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/853635/favorite-sandwich-recipes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sandwiches&lt;/a&gt;, as toast, or as a side dish.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whole grain bread is a type of high-protein bread, according to Giana DiMaria, MS, RD, CDN, CNSC, CCMS, registered dietitian at New York Medical College. However, there are many varieties available, so be sure to choose one labeled "100 percent whole wheat flour," says DiMaria. The ingredient list should also include whole grains such as &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1527161/oats-steel-cut-rolled-quick-lowdown" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;oats&lt;/a&gt;, barley, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/millets-health-benefits-cooking-info-7486377" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;millet&lt;/a&gt;, brown rice, spelt, or &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/what-is-sorghum-8723400" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;sorghum&lt;/a&gt;, which are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/best-plant-based-proteins-11710274" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;plant sources of protein&lt;/a&gt;, she notes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To make &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/what-are-sprouted-foods-8743276" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sprouted grain bread&lt;/a&gt;, whole grains (which are technically seeds) are allowed to sprout, or germinate. This is done by soaking the grains until they sprout, per DiMaria. "The sprouting process makes the grains easier to digest and increases the bioavailability of protein," says Landry. "Sprouted bread is also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/high-fiber-foods-11725829" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;good for fiber&lt;/a&gt;, B vitamins, magnesium, and folate," says Connie Elick, MS, RD, and instructor of plant-based culinary arts at the Institute of Culinary Education's Los Angeles campus.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When seeds are incorporated into bread, the final protein content is higher. Examples of seeds that may be used in bread include pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/how-to-eat-flax-seeds-8681980" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flax seeds&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/benefits-of-chia-seeds-11759791" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;, according to Landry. Seeds also provide healthy fats (particularly &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/best-omega-3-foods-to-eat-11815581" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;), vitamin E, magnesium, and zinc, he notes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some breads contain nuts, which offer plant-based protein and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/best-anti-inflammatory-foods-11716890" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory fats&lt;/a&gt;. Nuts also contain insoluble fiber, which bulks the stool and regulates bowel movements, says DiMaria. It's common to find high-protein breads made with a mixture of nuts and seeds.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "These breads are made with flours from &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/8192192/health-benefits-lentils" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lentils&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/garbanzo-beans-vs-chickpeas-8362708" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chickpeas&lt;/a&gt;, or other legumes, which are protein-rich," explains Landry. Depending on the product, the legume flours may be used as the primary ingredient or blended with traditional grain flours, he says. Legume-based bread "can also be a good source of carbohydrates, fiber, phosphorus, manganese, zinc, and other nutrients," per Elick.&lt;br&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(CNN) —&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;a href="https://cnn.com/2025/05/27/health/genetic-mutation-sperm-donor-scli-intl"&gt;sperm donor with a rare genetic mutation&lt;/a&gt; linked to an increased risk of developing &lt;a href="https://cnn.com/2025/12/06/politics/food-and-drug-administration-turmoil-leadership"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; fathered at least 197 children across Europe, some of whom have already died from the disease, according to a new investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The donor, who is himself healthy, had a rare mutation in a gene named TP53, which is likely to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare disorder that increases a person’s risk of developing cancer. He was unaware when he made the sperm donations that he was affected by the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, CNN reported that the man had fathered at least 67 children in eight European countries, but a major investigation published by news outlets Wednesday has shown that the number of affected children is in fact far higher than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgmy90z991o"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of 14 European public service broadcasters involved in the investigation, the new figure is the product of freedom of information requests and interviews with doctors and patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man donated to a single private sperm bank in Denmark named the European Sperm Bank (ESB), but his sperm was later used by 67 clinics in 14 different countries. The final number of affected children may be higher still, “as data has not been obtained from all countries,” the BBC added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not known how many of these children have inherited the genetic mutation, but only a small proportion of those who have done so will avoid developing some form of cancer in their lifetimes. People with the condition have a 90% chance of developing one or more kinds of cancer by age 60, and around 50% do so before age 40, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22073-li-fraumeni-syndrome"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edwige Kasper, a biologist at Rouen University Hospital in France, identified an initial 67 children during a presentation at the annual conference of the European Society of Human Genetics in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, she said 10 of the children had been diagnosed with cancers such as brain tumors and Hodgkin lymphoma, and another 13 were carrying the gene but had not yet developed a cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will require regular medical examinations due to their increased risk of developing cancer, and have a 50% chance of transmitting it on to their own children, Kasper said back in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Clare Turnbull, professor of cancer genetics at the Institute of Cancer Research, London, told CNN that “Li Fraumeni syndrome is a devastating diagnosis to impart to a family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a very high risk of cancer throughout the lifetime,” she added, “with a sizeable risk of childhood-onset cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case “represents a highly unfortunate coincidence of two exceptionally unusual events: that the donor’s sperm carry mutations for an extremely rare genetic condition affecting fewer than 1 in 10,000 people and that his sperm has been used in the conception of such an extraordinarily large number of children,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Herbert, professor of reproductive biology at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, said the investigation “highlights an urgent need for more comprehensive genetic screening of sperm donors and for strict cross-border controls on the number of children conceived from a single donor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is staggering that a single donor was used to conceive almost 200 children across a relatively small number of European countries,” she told CNN in a statement sent via the Science Media Centre on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Paulli Budtz, a spokeswoman for the European Sperm Bank (ESB), told CNN that the company is “deeply affected by the case and the impact that the rare TP53 mutation has on a number of families, children and the donor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They have our deepest sympathy,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ESB tests and performs an individual medical assessment of all donors in full compliance with recognized and scientific practice and legislation,” Budtz said, adding that the ESB supports calls for a limit on the number of children that are allowed to be born using a single donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The legislation on these areas is complex, with many and often conflicting considerations, and the implementation of the regulation differs greatly from country to country,” she added. “Hence, there is need for common and transparent European standards.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The-CNN-Wire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;™ &amp;amp; © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

To make up for the lack of published information, he included conference presentations and preliminary, unpublished findings in the review paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Upon compiling available evidence, Van Ameringen and his team found “stronger signals” for the efficacy of psychedelics, specifically psilocybin (the psychoactive component of “magic mushrooms,”) than for cannabinoids like THC and CBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Van Ameringen theorizes that the difference is related to how these substances interact with areas of the brain related to OCD. While cannabinoids activate the brain’s CB1 receptors, which regulate symptoms like compulsions and anxiety, available evidence shows they don’t offer lasting relief from OCD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Psilocybin, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07624-5" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can reduce connectivity&lt;/a&gt; in the brain’s default mode network, which “essentially is involved in self referential thinking and rumination. The default mode network is really activated in OCD”, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A difference in the methodology of cannabis and psilocybin studies might also have contributed to the different results, says Dr Mohamed Sherif, a psychiatrist and computational neuroscientist at Brown University who will lead a future clinical trial on psilocybin for OCD. Psychedelic clinical trials, like the one Sherif is planning, tend to offer patients not only medication but also encouragement to frame their experience as a therapeutic “journey”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This was not done in cannabinoids [studies,]” Sherif explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Terrence Ching, a clinical psychologist at the Yale School of Medicine, similarly wondered if the way people use cannabis versus psilocybin might explain the different outcomes. While people tend to use cannabis for temporary relief, psilocybin can help facilitate actual changes in the brain and in patients’ perception of their OCD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“One could use cannabis for the same therapeutic reason, of confronting something deeper about their OCD or their obsessive fears. But conventionally, people tend to use cannabis for an avoidance function,” Ching explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Preliminary results from Ching’s clinical trial on a single dose of psilocybin for OCD were included in Van Ameringen’s review paper, and showed that psilocybin was effective for OCD symptoms compared to placebo. Ching is now preparing the results of the trial for publication, and planning a second clinical trial where OCD patients will receive two doses of psilocybin at different times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During the single dose trial, 11 patients each received psilocybin or niacin, a placebo intended to mimic some of psilocybin’s effects so that patients would be unsure which drug they’d received. During dosing sessions, patients would sit with two facilitators who would offer minimal guidance in the form of open ended questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ching said his protocol included strict rules about the type of touch that was allowed if patients requested it – only a hand on the shoulder or forearm – to create unambiguous ethical limits. &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-mdma-therapy-videos-1.6400256" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Past psychedelic clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; have generated controversy when facilitators initiated unwanted touch with participants who were under the influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ching said the trial was useful not only in showing that psychedelics can improve OCD symptoms, but also in revealing more about the nature of OCD, both for clinicians and for the participants themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Psilocybin is known for inducing “mystical experiences”, characterized by a specific type and intensity of psychedelic effects, according to Ching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“What we see in OCD is more often partial mystical experiences, people are kind of pumping the brakes when they have a sense that the psilocybin wants to take them into a deeper state of experiencing,” Ching said, adding that this highlights one of the core features of the disorder – the need to be in control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While clinicians in psychedelic trials might typically encourage patients to go deeper, Ching said that with OCD patients, it’s important to remain “non-directive and non-judgemental”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During the trial, Ching saw patients recognize their own resistance to the drug and gain deeper insight into their need for control, saying things like: “I really realize that this is how I’ve approached unknowable things in my life, but that’s what life is. Life is full of unknowable things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ching is hopeful about the future of psychedelic medications, but there are several obstacles that make researching them difficult. Psilocybin is still an illegal schedule I substance in the US, which means that researchers must take additional steps to study it, including working with a DEA liaison and using a DEA approved safe that “needs to be bolted down to the ground”, in a private windowless room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers also must deal with the issue of “functional unblinding”, or the fact that psychedelic effects can mean trial participants are able to guess whether they received psilocybin or a placebo, which could alter their perception of their own symptoms. This is especially problematic given the hype around psychedelics, Ching said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many participants will enter a trial expecting a “miracle cure” – a narrative Ching believes is actually harmful to psychedelic research: “What we need to do now is to seriously, to treat psychedelics seriously, as any other worthwhile medication, to investigate in a controlled, rigorous way, in a way that is ethical, that pays homage to traditional Indigenous users of psychedelics, because there are, there is great wisdom there too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 16:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNeFVSNkdROUtpNC1RZnVkRHZCbDRwLWdNVUxoY3ZkSERTNkxpTzBlM3hhNkRjTHNkRWJEZWNpT1d0SEYtWk00bEUtdHZEMTlkM2c5UFhuUXdJWXpGV0NpbGJPeVZGZlN6bDFTTGlJMUlFdDhtZWFWNk1NemxGZTY2Z2ZwMWpUb190UmpoX1NR</guid></item><item><title>康涅狄格州报告4年多来首例麻疹病例--《波士顿环球报》</title><link>https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/12/13/metro/connecticut-reports-first-measles-case-in-2025/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content

Electromagnetic radiation in the form of light or sound waves hit a mirror or wall, respectively, and change course. This allows our eyes to see a reflection or echo of the original input. However, for more than 50 years, &lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1139931" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scientists have theorized;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;scientists have theorized&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that there’s another kind of reflection in quantum mechanics known as time reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This term might conjure up images of &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a20718322/building-a-time-machine/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a nuclear-powered DeLorean;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a nuclear-powered DeLorean&lt;/a&gt; or a particular police box (that’s bigger on the inside), but that’s not quite what scientists mean by the term. Instead, time reflections occur when the entire medium in which an electromagnetic wave travels suddenly changes course. This causes a portion of that wave to reverse and its frequency transforms into another one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because these time reflections require a uniform variation across an entire electromagnetic field, scientists assumed it would require too much energy to actually observe time reflections in action. But scientists from the Advanced Science Research Center at the CUNY Graduate Center (CUNY ASRC) in New York City &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/982119" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:successfully observed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;successfully observed&lt;/a&gt; time reflections by sending broadband signals into a strip of metal filled with electronic switches that were connected to reservoir capacitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This allowed the researchers to trigger the switches at will, doubling impedance along the strip. This sudden change caused the signals to carry a successful time-reversed copy. The results were published in the journal &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41567-023-01975-y&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fa69717180%2Ftime-reflections-are-real-scientists-confirm%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature Physics;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Physics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It is very difficult to change the properties of a medium quick enough, uniformly, and with enough contrast to time reflect electromagnetic signals because they oscillate very fast,” Gengyu Xu, a coauthor and post-doc student at CUNY ASRC, said in a press statement. “Our idea was to avoid changing the properties of the host material, and instead create a metamaterial in which additional elements can be abruptly added or subtracted through fast switches.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This time reflection also behaves differently than spatial reflections. Because this time echo reflects that last part of the signal first, the researchers say that if you looked in a &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; mirror, you would see your back instead of your face. To translate the experience acoustically, it’d be like listening to a tape on rewind—which is to say fast and high-pitched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The shift in frequency, if it could be perceived by our eyes, would look like colors of light suddenly changing to another color, such as red switching to green. This strange counter-intuitive nature of time reflection is part of what has made studying the concept so difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This has been really exciting to see, because of how long ago this counterintuitive phenomenon was predicted, and how different time-reflected waves behave compared to space-reflected ones,” corresponding author Andrea Alù, a physics professor and director of CUNY ASRC’s Photonics Initiative, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The big question: &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;hy&lt;/em&gt; have scientists worked toward recreating this theoretical time reflection in a laboratory? Well, more minute control of electromagnetic waves can vastly improve wireless communications and even lead to advancements in low-energy, wave-based computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In other words, it simply helps to know everything there is about electromagnetic waves—both forward and backward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 15:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOVnBWZ3dKY3o4OVJDdzdjNFpRWFNnQmJpQjlwUGpTdmszZ095WDFqWnVkb0pXWTRIS3JqQ1hwRGlMTDFwX181ZzBwd1JfU2VhLWxHb1ZZODYwdW1IaFg0MTlTZkRmcEVLQ0czQUJlX1dvVGk5RjF2enNfRERadGNRYWZuVWVNOTNGcjFsWGNWeU5ueVZVczVmTUc5dw</guid></item></channel></rss>
